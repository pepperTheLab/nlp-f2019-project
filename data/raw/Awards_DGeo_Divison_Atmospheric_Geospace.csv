Real-time severe storm prediction is a challenging task that currently requires a human forecaster with a thorough understanding of the dynamics and current state of the atmosphere.  This study will develop and apply data science techniques to four-dimensional radar data from severe storms throughout the continental U.S. with the goal of identifying critical spatiotemporal relationships that can improve the understanding and prediction of tornadoes.  The long-term goal will be to develop techniques to fundamentally improve our understanding of severe storms in general (including hail, wind, and tornadoes) by analyzing the new knowledge identified by the data science models.<br/><br/>This study seeks to advance the scientific knowledge of tornadogenesis by identifying novel precursors to tornadoes in two unique 4D weather radar datasets. Data science has the potential to advance knowledge by processing and objectively evaluating a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time. This provides a mechanism by which large, complicated meteorological datasets can be assessed for their predictive capability or alternative applications without the need for time consuming subjective evaluation. The methods developed will enable others to evaluate existing Earth system data to a spatiotemporal extent that is not possible with established approaches.  The application of data science techniques to a novel domain will require the development of new techniques focusing on spatiotemporal 4D weather radar data."

Solutions to these problems can have strong socioeconomic impacts. Advances in computing and big data analytics are essential in obtaining these solutions, allowing us to make appropriate assessment of resources in light of future issues related to climate change. These solutions likewise require broad thinking that can only be afforded by promoting diversity. However, Geoscience has historically produced the lowest number of minority doctorates in STEM and has been one of the least diverse disciplines. Similarly, gender inequality has continued to plague Computer Science. <br/><br/>The REU site provides opportunities for undergraduates to conduct research projects that integrate computing and geoscience to advance on-going research activities related to coastal zones, climate variability, and big data analysis. For example, research activities by REU students will help seek ways to improve climate forecasting, better understand physical processes in the coastal zones, increase national preparedness for climate change, understand the nexus between food, energy and water and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. To promote interest and increase diversity in Geoscience and Computer Science, underrepresented students will be recruited from South Carolina, nearby states, and the Southeastern U.S. region, especially those attending all-women and historically black colleges and universities with limited research opportunities. The REU site's goals are (1) to increase the percentage of women and other underrepresented students in graduate programs and careers in Computer Science and Geoscience, (2) to provide meaningful research experiences in computing intensive research topics of societal relevance, and (3) to provide a supportive environment for students to improve their research, critical-thinking, problem-solving and communication skills."

The fundamental measurement is a time difference caused by bending and delay of GPS radio waves as they propagate through the Earth's charged atmosphere and then through the density gradients of the neutral atmosphere.  The elegance and simplicity of the measurement is related to the GPS's purposefully chosen radio frequencies; as unaffected as possible by the intervening atmosphere as they reach the Earth's surface, making them all weather, unaffected by clouds, aerosols, etc.  This renewal project builds and continues to improve on earlier work supported by NSF and its partner U.S. agencies, NOAA, Air Force, NASA and Navy, with costs shared equally by the United States and Taiwan, which operate the COSMIC satellites.<br/><br/>Since its launch in April 2006, COSMIC has provided high quality data for science and operational use.  The UCAR COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) is currently producing between 1,000 and 1,500 Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) soundings per day. COSMIC data are now being assimilated in near real-time by most global numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers, including the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).<br/><br/>Since its launch, the COSMIC system has produced close to 3 million high quality neutral atmospheric and ionospheric GPS RO profiles and many other valuable data products.  These high resolution globally distributed data sets are being used to advance Earth system science by approximately 1,700 registered users from 55 countries, representing major U.S. and international universities, leading operational weather centers, research laboratories, and several private companies. <br/><br/>The work being conducted  includes: (i) operation and maintenance of the CDAAC for data processing, quality control, and dissemination; (ii) improvement of the quality and quantity of COSMIC data products by enhancing the GPS RO science payload firmware and CDAAC software processing algorithms; and, (iii) operation of the COSMIC Program Office to support the national and international science communities. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  This project has high intellectual merit in that it operates, maintains and improves the state-of-the-art COSMIC radio occultation processing system that provides global, continuous, and all-weather observations of the atmosphere and ionosphere for research and operations.  The COSMIC system is providing a gold-standard RO data set.  This project will lead to cutting edge advances in system operation, GPS signal tracking, data processing, and inversion techniques to maximize its research value for the atmospheric sciences. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The COSMIC data have significant impact on research and operations in the atmospheric sciences because of their quantity and quality, complete global and diurnal sampling, and their ability to penetrate deeply into the lower troposphere.  The fact that the COSMIC data are of high precision and accuracy, high vertical resolution, and require no inter-satellite cross-calibration, makes them ideally suited for climate research and instrument validation.  COSMIC also provides much-needed ionospheric observations for analysis and forecasting of space weather, and other ionospheric research.  This project also has a significant education and outreach component.  It will involve graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows in scientific collaborations, and will continue to organize science workshops and support education and training activities.  The COSMIC data and the processing software will continue to be made freely available to the broad university and user community.  Beyond COSMIC, these activities will also have positive impacts on planning and execution of future RO missions."

For understanding the physical mechanisms of the complex multi-scale processes on the Sun and developing Space Weather forecasting techniques, it is critical to develop a common cyberinfrastructure to collect, access, analyze, share and visualize all forms of data from ground-based and space observatories, as well as from data-driven numerical simulations and modeling, and develop capabilities for their efficient analysis using advanced computer science techniques. The main goal of this project is to create a Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will foster new collaborations between heliophysics and computer scientists, which will result in ideas and concrete plans for developing building blocks supporting the goals of the EarthCube initiative. This RCN will actively encourage involvement of a diverse pool of community members and will provide an organized virtual structure that will promote a science transforming open source knowledge collaboration. This collaboration will enhance the science return from individual research projects run by the RCN participants. <br/><br/>The activities of the RCN will be overseen by a steering committee composed of academic Heliophysicists and computer scientists from leading universities and research centers in the field. The steering committee will organize three topical working groups led by the members of the principal investigator (PI) team, which will address specific challenges related to: 1) Finding data and discovering knowledge, 2) Working with data and cross-disciplinary data, and 3) Simulations and modeling. The steering committee will organize topical working groups that will have as primary goals to build and strengthen the partnership between heliopyhsicists and cyber/computer scientists, foster new collaborations that will lead to better science outcomes, develop and discuss new ideas, methodologies and tools for efficient integration and analysis of the existing and upcoming large databases generated by space and ground-based observatories and supercomputer modeling centers. The RCN working groups will be led by the members of the PI Team, who will organize virtual seminars, as well as special sessions during general conferences in the field (such as the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union and the Solar Heliospheric and Interplanetary Environment conference). In addition, the PI team will organize annual plenary technical interchange meetings attended by all working groups. The RCN steering committee will closely work with the EarthCube Governance and participate in the annual EarthCube meetings. The RCN will actively involve students and young researchers in its working groups and promote and support their participations in the EarthCube meetings. The project outcomes will be published in regular project reports, scholarly articles, and presented at the EarthCube meetings and scientific conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their standard data products are not directly useful for most planning and decision-making processes that are increasingly confronted with climate change. They are (i) not giving the necessary variables and quantities at (ii) the required temporal and spatial scales, nor are they (iii) sufficiently quality tested for application-critical characteristics. The current ""hand-down"" approach for providing EaSM data to end users leads to substantial losses of knowledge about the scenarios, the data, and the tools involved. Yet that knowledge, accompanied by transparent and accessible information about uncertainty and best practices, is critical for ensuring effective decision-making. To realize the promise of extensive EaSM investments, the challenge is therefore to properly and effectively integrate its broad capabilities with operational applications so that it can be made relevant for users who need actionable, robust and transparent information.<br/><br/>This team brings together experts in climate modeling and data analysis, in water resource management operations and planning, and in weather and climate statistics. The focus is on water resources because of the central role of water in climate change impacts. The collaborative effort will focus on four primary tasks that will transform the use of EaSM output and related downscaled data for water resources: <br/>1. Identify the climate data, based on water resource management needs, that influence decision-making, using the team's understanding of key physical processes. <br/>2. Adapt and convert established quantitative weather-forecast verification methods for climate-model evaluation. Accessible and transparent evaluation statistics will be the cornerstone for establishing ""best practice"" uses. <br/>3. Characterize changes seen in future climate projections, using the new methods to link the changes and their uncertainties to specific climate change impacts and needs.<br/>4. Implement the new validation methods in the evaluation framework of the EaSM of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), where they can inform model development and enrich the model assessment through user-developed benchmarks. <br/><br/>A major hindrance in linking climate-change simulations with impacts on water-resources management is the differing perspectives of the modeling community, focused on globally important earth-system processes and feedbacks, and the water operations community, focused on local-scale processes specific to a region. The project will overcome this barrier through an extensive dialogue among the team members that identifies key decision information and how to extract it from an array of global and regional climate data available to the project. The effort will lead to new methods for integrating climate change science and data in water resource planning and operations and also new tools and benchmarks for assessing EaSM performance, useful for guiding model development.<br/><br/>This project is an initiative of the new Societal Dimensions Working Group of the NCAR Community Earth System Model. The Working Group seeks to engage climate scientists and climate-information users in a dialogue leading to more effective use of climate model output. The work will develop user-applicable data and improve quality control by identifying important, sector-motivated measures of climate behavior and sources of uncertainty for sector applications. The project's dialogue will provide a prototype for interactions with other water managers and open avenues for those in other operational activities (e.g., energy utilities, transportation sector, health community) to engage in substantive interaction with climate modelers on climate-change information."

The BBSO operates the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST), which is currently the highest-resolution operating solar telescope in the U.S.  This telescope enables spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the Sun's photosphere, chromosphere, and the base of the corona.  In the near future, the BBSO will become the new home for the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigation of the Sun (SOLIS) instrument, which is currently being operated by the National Solar Observatory.  After its relocation, the BBSO will become a comprehensive solar observing site, and it will be offering not only solar high-resolution observations, but also synoptic data of our star.<br/><br/>The GST will continue to dominate the high-resolution U.S. ground-based solar observations until the 4-meter DKIST acquires its first light in 2020.  Even when the DKIST becomes operational, the GST will still play a crucial role in joint campaign observations with the DKIST to maximize scientific return of both.  The unique observing conditions at the BBSO provide the GST with an opportunity to be dedicated to campaign studies, whereas the DKIST will have the complementing mission of serving individual users.  Comparable off-axis designs have made the GST an ideal test-bed, or path-breaker for various DKIST instrumentation and technologies.  Furthermore, most of the DKIST critical science cases can be tested and verified with the GST observations in advance to select the most critical and high impact cases for DKIST first light.  The BBSO plays a crucial role in training the next generation of scientists who build instruments and develop modern data analysis tools.  During this project, two PhD students will be supported to conduct cutting-edge research using the BBSO facilities.  The high-resolution data coupled with modeling and analytical tools will aid comprehensive studies of the origins of space weather.  The collected data have been, and they will continue to be, used in many PhD thesis works.  The BBSO solar data are fully open to the scientific community, and a substantial portion of the GST observing time is open to the community.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The GST plays, and it will continue to play, a leading role in advancing high-resolution studies of the Sun until the end of this decade and beyond.  During this five-year project, the BBSO team will obtain, analyze and interpret the highest resolution solar data ever taken, while developing and applying analytical tools in order to tackle a number of critical science questions related to solar research, in particular those pertaining to the origin of the solar activity.  This includes: (i) studies of flares and eruptive activity; (ii) studies of non-flaring activity of the solar atmosphere; and, (iii) studies of photospheric and low-chromospheric structures with the CYRA.  The CYRA is the first-of-its-kind fully cryogenic spectrograph, which is used to probe the rich spectral regime between 1.0 and 5.0 micron in the infrared.  The project team will use the CYRA's high-resolution observations in order to investigate the solar atmosphere above various magnetic structures.  The BBSO researchers will investigate the true magnetic fields distribution by the virtue of CYRA's high Zeeman sensitivity, and they will conduct thermal infrared observations of the flaring solar atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary payload of each satellite is a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) which receives positioning signals from  the GPS transmitter satellites as they rise and set relative to the COSMIC satellite. The GPS signals are refracted by the atmosphere as they travel from the transmitter to the receiver, to an extent which depends on the temperature and water vapor content of the lower atmosphere and the density of electric charge in the ionosphere. The refraction causes a delay in the phase of the transmitted signal which can be inverted to retrieve profiles of electron density (in the ionosphere), dry atmospheric temperature, and water vapor (although water vapor requires additional information). Because the profiles are retrieved from the rising and setting, or occultation, of the GPS transmitters, the technology is referred to as GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO), or more generally as GNSSRO, where GNSS is the Global Navigation Satellite System.  GNSSRO has proven to be a highly effective observing method as the measurements can be made under all weather conditions, are unaffected by clouds and aerosols, and are absolutely calibrated (SI traceable) through the clock system that supports the GPS transmitters.<br/><br/>Funds under this award support COSMIC-related work in four categories: 1) processing, serving, and archiving COSMIC data for use by the research community; 2) conducting research to improve GNSSRO inversion science and techniques; 3) conducting research in support of scientific applications of GNSSRO data; and 4) education and outreach activities to promote the use of GNSSRO data and its application to atmospheric research.  Item 1 is the bread-and-butter activity of this award and its predecessors, and support is also provided here for improving the quality of the profiles and generating additional data products such as monthly mean climatologies for both lower- and upper-atmospheric variables. In addition to the COSMIC satellites, a small number of GNSSRO ""missions of opportunity"" are also supported.  These are research satellites to which a GNSS receiver has been added as a secondary payload (GRACE-B for example).  Activities under item 2 continue the PIs' leadership role in the development of new GNSS processing techniques, for example by developing methods to correct errors caused by diffraction in sporadic E layers in the ionosphere. Research under item 3 develops new assimilation techniques such as the use of 2D ray-tracing methods to account for horizontal refractivity gradients.  Another task is to develop long-term climate-quality datasets in which profiles from different satellites are optimally combined to account for differences in their error characteristics. GNSSRO data are well-suited for generating long-term multi-mission datasets given their SI traceability.  Work under item 4 addresses a gap between the availability of GPSRO data and its adoption by the research community.  Activities include hosting academic visitors, conducting meetings and workshops, and holding summer colloquia and tutorials.<br/><br/>The work has intellectual merit due to the great value of the COSMIC observations for weather, climate and ionospheric research.  The work has scientific broader impacts through the PIs' education and outreach efforts to promote the adoption and use of the data by scientists from several research communities.  In addition, the PIs provide the COSMIC data to operational weather forecasting centers worldwide, and the data has been shown to be quite useful for improving the skill of weather forecasts.<br/><br/>This award supercedes AGS-1033112, the previous cooperative agreement under which NSF provided funds to COSMIC.  While NSF is no longer providing funds via the earlier CA, that award will remain active as it contains funds from other agencies to support the development of the follow-on COSMIC-2 mission.  This award does not provide funds for COSMIC-2."

There is much disagreement on whether we have already witnessed substantial impacts. The focal point of these debates is the question ""who-is-causing-who"", as changes in high latitudes take place at the same era as those in other latitudes, including mid-latitudes. The question how to infer the causality from data (observations and model outputs) is one of the most outstanding issues that the climate science community needs to resolve urgently. Here, the PI plans to apply causal discovery techniques, a unique type of statistical and data analysis, to the question of causal connections between the Arctic and mid-latitude circulation. These tools will provide insight into the causal pathways connecting Arctic temperatures to mid-latitude weather, quantify the ability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate these pathways, and assess how these pathways may change in the coming decades. <br/><br/>The funded research will advance our understanding of the two-way links between the Arctic and mid-latitude weather, which in turn, can lead to improvements in short-term weather forecasts as well as improvements in predictions of weather/climate variability in the coming decades. In addition, this project will include the development of an online ""gateway"" of accessible explanations of data analysis techniques with accompanying atmospheric-science-motivated examples for atmospheric scientists: the Data Analysis Tools for Atmospheric Scientists (DATAS) Gateway. The recent explosion of climate data and increasing complexity of earth-system models requires that now, more than ever, atmospheric scientists be equipped with the necessary skills to make novel and robust discoveries. A joint community effort is planned for creating, testing, and disseminating the DATAS Gateway material. These community coordinated research/education activities include peer contributions and review, graduate student workshops, statistical and gateway-developer consultants, and integration into current and planned curricula across seven universities. The DATAS Gateway will not only be a resource for scientists across the globe, but will also allow for the sharing of ideas and tools, spur scientific breakthroughs and support five undergraduate researchers. A sustainability plan will be developed to transition the DATAS Gateway to a community-driven effort to ensure that it outlives the 5-year horizon of this CAREER grant. The project as a whole will additionally support a graduate student and individuals under-represented in STEM by supporting the efforts of six female faculty (the PI and five collaborators).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a collaborative effort, led by Utah State University and with participation also from University of Southern California and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The objective is to first combine multiple existing first principles ionospheric data assimilation models to develop a modular Data Assimilation System (DAS) capable of modeling the global Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Electrodynamics (ITE).  Next, a Multi-model Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) will be constructed for modeling the I-T-E system that incorporates the existing data assimilation models with different physics, numerics, and initial conditions. MEPS will allow ensemble modeling with different data assimilation models for specific science studies and applications.  MEPS will be modular so that it can be coupled to lower atmosphere (weather) models and to first-principles-based magnetosphere models. Hence, MEPS can take account of upward propagating tides, planetary waves, and gravity waves. Since MEPS reconstructions will be consistent with the available I-T-E measurements, self-consistent ion outflows, convection E-fields, precipitation, currents, etc., can be provided to magnetosphere models for inputs and/or validation. The modular architecture also means that data assimilation models (ionosphere, thermosphere, electrodynamics) developed by others can be easily incorporated in MEPS. In addition, MEPS will include different data assimilation models for specific parts of the near-Earth space domain, which will allow ensemble modeling of specific events with several different data assimilation models. The MEPS data assimilation models will be made available to the scientific community so that others can study the I-T-E system with state-of-the-art data assimilation models. The use of these models will lead to a paradigm shift in how basic physical processes are studied in near-Earth space.<br/><br/>When completed, the MEPS model (with component data assimilation models; ionosphere, ionosphere-plasmasphere, thermosphere, high-latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics, and mid-low latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics) will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) for access by the scientific community and eventual transition to use for operational space weather forecasting.  The results of this effort will help provide a several hour predictive capability for the ITE that is a high priority national space weather need.

The magnetosphere is the high altitude extension of Earth?s magnetic field, and spans the region of space where the geosynchronous satellites orbit the Earth. Our magnetosphere responds dramatically, even violently, to solar storms resulting in geomagnetic storms and drives the electric currents that cause aurora borealis and intensify the Van Allen radiation belts. The electric currents that flow between Earth?s uppermost atmosphere and the high-altitude magnetosphere are a reflection of the state of the entire region of Earth?s space environment and their measurement allows us to study the system. The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) is the first ever system providing continuous, global measurements of these central electric currents and their dynamics as Earth?s magnetosphere responds to solar storms. AMPERE measures these currents by collecting the magnetic field data from all of the Iridium satellites, sampling the field from each satellite once every 20 seconds. There are 66 satellites in the Iridium constellation and AMPERE acquires data around the clock from every single one. With AMPERE we now have a system in place to provide continuous 24/7 pictures of what is really happening to near-Earth space, much like weather radars track the actual progress of weather fronts and major storm systems.   Iridium is a private sector constellation of satellites, owned by Iridium Communications. AMPERE is the first-of-its-kind partnership between the commercial sector and research scientists to achieve something that the government could not have accomplished on its own. The expansion of this achievement under AMPERE-II will yield the first capability to observe the electrodynamics of near-Earth space with the global, continuous coverage necessary to resolve geomagnetic storms. It places the scientific community in position to make major advances across a range of challenges in magnetosphere and ionosphere science. AMPERE-II will harness the full potential of these new data to transform our understanding of Earth?s interaction with near-space and increase our ability to cope with the effects of solar storms.<br/><br/>Electric power is the cornerstone technology on which virtually all other infrastructures and services depend. Yet it is particularly vulnerable to adverse space weather effects.  Protecting the nation?s power grids from the potential catastrophic effects of space weather is increasingly recognized as a critical element of ensuring the sustainability of modern society.  Currents induced in the power grid during geomagnetic storms can actually melt the copper windings of transformers at the heart of most power distribution systems.  Replacement of failed transformers can take weeks or months. Sprawling power lines act like antennas, picking up the currents and spreading the problem over a wide area.    Accurate understanding and reliable prediction of the electric currents in the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere that cause this space weather effect are crucial. If utility operators know a geomagnetic storm is coming and just how bad it?s going to be, they can take measures to reduce damage?e.g., disconnecting wires, shielding vulnerable electronics, or powering down critical hardware. A few hours without power is better than weeks or worse. AMPERE data continues to be the only global, continuous source for observations of the energy input into the ionosphere via electric currents that are critical for developing improved specification and forecasting of the ionospheric current systems that pose a potential hazard to the power grid. This makes the AMPERE project a critical component in our first line of defense against this potential space weather hazard. <br/><br/>AMPERE-II will provide key observations and derived products of the global Birkeland currents at timescales within geomagnetic storms and substorms together with analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on important science questions on magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling and dynamics, including:  How does the M-I system respond to driving by plasma and magnetic fields of CMEs? What is the M-I system response to solar wind high-speed streams? What are the stages and sequences of activity onset and electrodynamic reconfigurations? What do they tell us about underlying governing processes? How are radiation belt dynamics and high-altitude magnetic reconnection related to and governed by global electrodynamics? What are the consequences of high-latitude electrodynamic forcing for the thermosphere and ionosphere?  To maximize the use of AMPERE-II by the research community, the project will carry out a number of engagement activities, including: Forming an AMPERE Users Group as an open forum for updates, questions, requests, and discussion; Establishing an AMPERE Core Users Team as an advisory team to recommend/review new products, validation analyses, and organize workshops; Hosting a series of Science Mini-workshops for focused collaborative science discussion as well as Student Workshops envisioned as 2.5 day events of student science investigations and tutorials."

Previous research has shown that VLF waves from these sources play a significant role in the dynamics of Earths radiation environment. This project will focus on quantifying how much VLF energy from sources on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere propagates through the charged layers of Earth's upper atmosphere and into the magnetosphere.

This research will develop a new, integrated sensor capable of remotely sensing both the electric field change for lightning processes and the ambient electric field environment near a thunderstorm.  In particular, this work will modernize measurements of the charge neutralized by a lightning discharge and provide important experimental contributions to the field of atmospheric electricity and meteorology to better model the process and understand theoretical development. The new instrumentation will enable basic research into lightning leader physics, and its relationship to the storm environment and other available lightning attributes. Further, current investigations relating storm evolution and lightning activity rely on indirect measurements of the energetics of lightning. This work will directly measure this quantity and provide experimental data to improve theoretical understanding of the relationship between storm evolution and lightning.  Research will be pursuant to the NSF Big Ideas Initiative, in which data-driven discovery and decision-making are enabled through modeling and analysis of complex data.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Many investigations in the basic science and applications of lightning and its associated attributes rely on indirect measurements of the energetics of the discharge. This work will provide direct measurements of the charge neutralized by lightning, thereby enabling an improved understanding of how to use lightning in a variety of applications. This work focuses on two scientific applications: (1) the modeling of the environment in which a lightning leader propagates, and (2) the variation of charge neutralized by lightning in relation to thunderstorm development.  Various models of the electrical environment will be used to investigate what conditions exists that lead to higher leader speeds and large peak current return strokes. In addition, the attributes of failed leaders (leaders that do not immediately lead to return strokes) will be analyzed. To further investigate existing promising results relating severe weather development and lightning activity, this work will use direct measurements of the energetics of lightning.  This will provide a more robust experimental input to the theoretical understanding of the connection between a strengthening storm and lightning activity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Lightning is one of the most familiar atmospheric phenomena, yet research to fully realize the societal impacts of high quality lightning data continues to evolve. The ability to create this data via instrument development will help ensure a competitive STEM workforce; the development of sensors for this research will help provide important training in the next generation of scientists. The correlation of lightning and severe weather has yielded tantalizing possibilities in the use of lightning data to aid severe storm warnings. Research from this project will be used for real-time displays of the electrical environment and not just current lightning activity, increasing lead time to get personnel to safety. In addition, the improved understanding of ongoing storms and lightning activity, particularly ones that may become severe, will have the capability to further show the benefit of quality lightning instrumentation. This is particularly useful, as the launch of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is scheduled in November 2016. This instrument will provide total lightning data and measurement of lightning energetics across a large section of the Western Hemisphere. In addition, two education initiatives will be enabled by this work. The basic design of a digitizing system will be incorporated into a currently in-development course on data typically used by atmospheric and earth scientists.  In addition, a lightning module suitable for high school science classes will be created.  This will include development of an instrument that can be assimilated into current research, providing a unique STEM educational experience."

The errors are assumed to be Gaussian, or evenly distributed, but for some variables that may not be the case.  The research in this award will improve our understanding of non-Gaussian errors.  The potential impact on society would be improved weather forecasting.  Data assimilation is also growing in other areas of science, so the research potentially has cross-cutting applications.  An early career scientist will also be trained in this growing area of research.<br/><br/>The research team will address several different aspects about how non-Gaussian distributed errors affect data assimilation and retrieval systems, but also how to detect when the Gaussian assumption is not optimal.  Research will move forward on five topics:  1) Build conditional probability density functions (PDF) for different atmospheric dynamics from forecast difference fields, as a proxy for the background error fields, and then develop mathematical and stochastical models to link the conditional PDFs to specific atmospheric dynamics, 2) Derive, test in a toy problem, and then implement into the WRF-GSI, a mixed PDF hybrid variational-ensemble system, 3) Investigate the impact of different PDF assumptions for different scales of dynamics in both retrieval and hybrid data assimilation systems, 4) Extend the lognormal detection algorithm to a near real-time capability for educational diagnostics, 5) Create web pages to illustrate the different values that the systems produce combined with the detection algorithm output as an educational tool for researchers to see the effects of the distributions on the performance of the retrievals."

This project will contribute essential results to this goal pertaining to understanding the global reaction of the Earth's magnetosphere-ionosphere system to the solar wind and how the solar wind couples to the magnetosphere.  The reaction of the magnetosphere to driving as well as the driving by the solar wind are more complex than commonly thought and than current models can capture or explain.

The ""indices"" will be measures of the currents, plasmas, energetic particles, waves, morphology, and energy flow in the system. The collection of time-dependent indices will be put together to form a time-dependent ""Earth Index Collection"" of measurements. Canonical correlation analysis will be used to identify and explore correlation patterns between the multivariable Earth index collection and the multivariable solar-wind data set. For the primary mode of reaction of the Earth index collection to the solar wind, a time-dependent ""collective index"" will be identified and defined and the universal coupling function that drives that primary mode will be defined. Secondary global modes of the reaction of the Earth to the solar wind will be identified, cataloged, and investigated and the properties of the solar wind (the secondary coupling functions) that drive the secondary modes will be identified. Attempts will be made to connect the secondary coupling functions with physical mechanisms such as the viscous interaction, changes in the location of the dayside reconnection line, and changes in the morphology of the magnetosphere. By analysis of the secondary modes of reaction, the ""sectors"" of the Earth index collection will be identified and the indices that comprise each sector will be cataloged. Exploring suppression and confounding in the multivariable solar-wind data set as its variables correlate with the Earth measurements, causal correlations versus non-causal correlations will be identified.

Speleothem records (i.e., oxygen and carbon isotopes, crystal fabrics, trace elements, strontium and uranium isotopes) will be developed from cave monitoring.  An isotope-enabled reactive transport modeling tool will be used to parse the multiple interrelated environmental influences on environmental proxies.

Quantitative comparison of these maps with isotope-enabled climate models for time slices through the last deglaciation and Holocene will help clarify the driving mechanisms behind precipitation change and regional climate variability. Expected outcomes of the research include: 1) development of a history of precipitation variability along the U.S. west coast consisting of overlapping stalagmite records from multiple proxies for extending to 33,000 years before the present; 2) cross-validation of proxy and monitoring data with isotope-enabled reactive transport models 3) evaluation of speleothem initial Uranium isotope ratios as a paleo-infiltration indicator; 4) detailed records of inter-annual to multi-decadal precipitation variability at sites with contrasting modern precipitation responses to ocean-atmosphere oscillations and perspective on the evolution of these patterns through time; 5) evaluation of the driving mechanisms of California precipitation variability, including megadrought conditions, through proxy-model comparisons; and 6) improved understanding of the role of changing moisture source in the development and decay of drought conditions.<br/><br/>The education plan builds on the researcher's ongoing relationship with the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt University (SSMV) through multi-year mentoring of a team of high school students from the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) who will conduct field experiments, geochemical research, and ultimately, the creation of an online educational tool for use in Tennessee classrooms.

In tandem, undergraduate and graduate students will construct and run a set of citizen science projects aimed at the investigation of particle acceleration in solar flares using data from the past generation of (indirect) hard X-ray observations.  The family of citizen science projects will serve the important purpose of education at the university level and will additionally serve as a solar physics outreach tool as we directly engage the public in high-energy research.  Thus, education, outreach, and research are naturally integrated within the project.  It is intended that these initial citizen science efforts will develop and blossom beyond the extent of this project, opening up citizen science as a platform to analyze the wealth of data provided by multi-wavelength observations of the Sun.  In addition, this project will provide significant support for a relatively new solar physics research group at the University of Minnesota that includes several early-career women, directly affecting the future gender balance of the solar and stellar physics communities.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The research program of this five-year CAREER project constitutes an integrated approach to studying particle acceleration and coronal heating associated with impulsive energy releases (flares) on the Sun and other stars.  The main objective is to investigate how high-energy flare properties scale with total energy released by using newly available focused hard X-ray measurements.  This objective will be achieved through three complementary efforts.  Firstly, existing and anticipated data sets from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Focusing Optics X- ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) will be used to investigate the physics of small microflares on the Sun.  Second, the first set of focused hard X-ray observations of young stellar objects (YSOs) will be analyzed to understand energy release in giant flares.  Finally, a student-built family of citizen science projects will analyze solar flares observed over the last solar cycle by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in order to unearth new insight into flare particle acceleration.  The research agenda is expected to significantly advance flare knowledge by illuminating the physics of small-scale energy release in sub-A-class microflares -- a regime never before studied at high energies.  Furthermore, the project will utilize never-before-available hard X-ray observations of YSO flares to investigate whether they are governed by the same processes of energy release, particle acceleration, and heating as in solar flares, and will ascertain the aspects of those flares that may have the ability to affect developing planetary systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These incoherent scatter radars (ISRs) are used to examine the properties of the electromagnetically charged layers of Earth's atmosphere. AMISR science is directly relevant to several societally important aspects of space weather, including geomagnetically induced currents, satellite drag, radio scintillation, radio absorption, the radiation belt particle environment, and space weather impacts on transpolar aviation. In addition to maintaining infrastructure that enables research and education, student involvement in AMISR research is supported by prioritizing student experiments, attending community workshops, recruiting undergraduates through the SRI Research Experience for Undergraduates program, recruiting undergraduates at UAF to assist with optical data analysis, and participating in the annual ISR summer school. <br/><br/>The project includes the continued operation and maintenance of these facilities at their current locations with no new construction or major repairs. The AMISR facilities offer unique observational capabilities that continue to enable a variety of scientific investigations related to multiple Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey goals for Solar Wind-Magnetosphere and Atmosphere- Ionosphere-Magnetosphere interactions. RBO is the only incoherent scatter radar site in the world above 80 degree geomagnetic latitude. This location deep in the polar cap permits unique investigations of the polar geospace environment. The combination of the advanced radar capabilities of PFISR, the extensive suite of optical instruments in Alaska, the sounding rocket launch capabilities at the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), and the location of PFRR in the main auroral oval make PFRR one of the premiere sites in the world for research in upper atmospheric physics, auroral plasma physics, and magnetosphere- ionosphere coupling. The AMISR operations and maintenance team will proactively support user-driven science through a variety of community engagement activities. Furthermore, the SRI team will develop new data products and documentation to enable future science investigations. SRI International (SRI), the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), and ATCO Structures and Logistics (ATCO) will jointly manage this project. The operation and maintenance plan includes managing user-requested experiments for each radar, continued operation of continuous low duty cycle operations at PFISR, routine analysis and distribution of data, maintenance of existing hardware, and logistical support for all other instruments at RBO. Additionally, several engineering studies to formulate long-term maintenance plans for the facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will collect data from the AMBER, MEASURE and SAMBA magnetometer arrays and process the data in a uniform manner. The data will be used in several different research projects. One of the major projects will be to improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the plasmasphere, including the mass density within the plasmasphere and the location of the plasmapause. The other major research project is to understand how ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves propagate from high to low latitudes and how these waves affect the structure of the equatorial electrojet. Such wave activity may play an important role in the formation of plasma bubbles in the electrojet which then cause strong radio-wave scintillations. Radio-wave scintillations are an important space weather phenomenon that can affect radio communications and GPS location services. <br/><br/>In addition to the fundamental research to be carried out by the members of the project, the data from the instruments will be made available to other scientific researchers through a simple web portal. The project will also include education and public outreach activities that involve middle and high school teachers and students. Teachers and students will use the data to enhance public understanding of Earth's space environment.<br/><br/>There are two main scientific goals of this program. The first goal is to understand the structure and dynamics of the plasmasphere. To examine that topic the project will make use of resonant oscillations of ULF waves in the plasmasphere. The resonant waves allow one to determine the mass loading along the magnetic field lines that pass through the locations of the magnetometers. The field-line resonance data can also be used to identify the location of the plasmapause (or more accurately, the location of the plasmasphere boundary layer). The PBL can commonly be located on the dayside because ULF wave activity is a common phenomenon on the dayside. In order to locate the PBL on the nightside, the project will utilize TEC (total electron content) data from GPS measurements. <br/><br/>The second major scientific goal of the project is to investigate the dynamics of the equatorial electrojet, including the affects of ULF waves and the formation of large plasma irregularities that lead to radio scintillation effects. Radio scintillations at low and equatorial latitudes can have significant effects on radio communications and GPS location accuracy. Indeed, when strong radio scintillation occurs, GPS receives may fail to work at all. This project will examine the longitudinal variability of density irregularities and scintillation. It will also determine how often and under what solar wind conditions ULF waves can propagate from high latitudes to low and equatorial latitudes."

OPAL will measure lower thermospheric temperatures from 90?140 km altitude by observing the daytime O2 A-band (near 762nm) emission with a high-sensitivity, hyper-spectral limb imager. The instrument will be incorporated into a 3U Colony 2 CubeSat provided by the National Reconnaissance Office.  <br/><br/>The lower thermosphere is an important interface between the lower and upper atmosphere, but progress in our understanding has been hindered by a paucity of measurements in this critical region. The OPAL mission will help fill this gap by providing much needed global observations of the neutral temperatures, which in turn will lead to an improved understanding of the physical processes that are responsible for day-to-day changes in the I/T system on global, regional, and local scales. In particular, it is important to measure how energy propagates from high to lower latitudes and to quantify the wave coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere.  OPAL will directly measure the thermal response at low and middle latitudes to geomagnetic activity. OPAL will quantify the global characteristics of waves from below within the lower thermosphere by measuring their temperature signatures.<br/><br/>The mission is being proposed jointly by the Space Dynamics Laboratory at Utah State University (USU/SDL) and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), the Hawk Institute for Space Sciences (HISS) and Dixie State College of Utah (DSC). A majority of the OPAL mission will be developed and implemented by graduate and undergraduate students with professional staff serving as mentors. The program will combine USU/SDL, UMES, HISS, and DSC student training and participation. Physics students will play a major role in the science team, data analysis, and publication of the scientific findings. Engineering students will produce spacecraft and instrument design drawings, develop, integrate and test hardware, and calibrate the instrument.  The OPAL mission also would be the first cubesat to fly a scientific hyper-spectral imager payload.  Hyper-spectral imaging measurements are extremely important to many areas of research, including atmospheric chemistry, ocean depth and temperature, land-use, ecology, astronomy, and surveillance. It's a challenging payload for a cubesat mission due to the requirements (power, attitude control, data rates, etc) the imager poses on the cubesat system, making this a high-risk-high-reward project."

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur.  The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work in this project is specifically focused on understanding the formation of ice crystals in SO clouds, a necessary step in determining whether the relatively low abundance of ice particles compared to SLW droplets is due to a dearth of INPs.  A specialized wing-mounted inlet called a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) is used to collect cloud liquid droplets and ice crystals and separate them from ambient aerosols and other non-cloud material.  Further processing using a device known as a continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) separates INPs from cloud condensation nuclei (CCN, the particles on which water vapor condenses to form liquid droplets) which are not conducive to ice formation.  INPs are collected and later analyzed using laboratory techniques including electron and X-ray microscopy to determine their composition and other properties. Similar data is collected on an Australian research vessel operating in the same region.  These data are combined with additional campaign data to address questions including:<br/><br/>* Are INP concentrations predictive of the extent of cloud glaciation?<br/><br/>* What are the relative roles of sea spray from the underlying ocean and long-range transport in the free troposphere as sources for INPs in SO clouds?<br/><br/>* Can INP characteristics and abundances be related to surface seawater composition (measured on the research vessel), including organic matter and biological activity?<br/><br/>* What evidence do SOCRATES observations provide for the occurrence or absence of secondary ice formation processes (i.e. ice particles formed from other ice particles in various ways)?<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors.  Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments.  The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research. The work also promotes international scientific collaboration through its partnership with Australian colleagues. Summer internships are planned at the PIs' home institution to allow undergraduate students to participate in post-campaign data analysis, as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website.  This project provides support and training to a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Comparison of the turbulence data to lightning flash rate and extent will test the hypothesis that turbulent convective motions are the source of electrical energy in storms. The rich textural character of thunderstorm data will be conveyed to the public in an innovative art exhibit. Data and software will be shared openly alongside traditional forms of publication.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>After thunderstorms become electrified, it is of basic interest to understand how often lightning will occur and how extensive those lightning flashes will be. Electrical potential energy stored in a storm's electric field is the result of charge carried on precipitating and non-precipitating hydrometeors which are themselves embedded in the storm's flow. In updraft regions of the storm, where conditions are most favorable for electrification, the storm's flow is highly turbulent, while downstream in anvils or in organized stratiform precipitation regions, flow is smoother. Recent work with a Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) has revealed that a lightning energy spectrum calculated from flash extent and flash rate looks much like the energy spectrum that would be predicted by Kolmogorov's classical turbulence theory for thunderstorm convective plumes. This project will assess turbulent characteristics of thunderstorms using high-resolution radars to quantitatively measure thunderstorm kinematics with weather radars. The combination of radar and LMA data will provide a quantitative test of the hypothesis that turbulence controls the distribution of sizes of charge regions, which in turn controls flash rate and extent. By establishing quantitative links between convective and electrical energy at the range of scales native to both lightning and the convective character of the plume, this project is expected to establish a fundamental new relationship between lightning and deep convection, including a reliable statistical statement about the distribution of flash sizes expected in thunderstorms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>Attending lightning are recreational, commercial and environmental impacts, which makes lightning an area of interest to individuals and formal decision support services provided by and between businesses and government agencies. This project will help clarify the distribution of electrical potential in storms, which controls to a large extent whether a flash strikes ground. The field campaign and its results will be shared at local high schools to stimulate interest in science and mathematics. During the project, artists will produce an immersive gallery exhibit derived from field data. This exhibit will include a survey component to test its effectiveness in presenting lightning data with the rich texture as it actually exists in storms, countering notions of lightning as singleton storm-wide discharges between simple vertically stacked charge layers. Data collection, analysis, and publication of results in a team setting will provide students with scholarly and methodological training through a project that is rich in cross-disciplinary theory and in practical skills tied to observational work. In an era of increasing computational resources and emphasis on data management and digital knowledge dissemination, this project will train students to adopt best practices in reproducible scientific research using open, pan-disciplinary tools enabled by dispersed, diverse internet-based communities."

The three stations are important because they enable long-term cosmic-ray modulation studies with a data base dating back six Solar Cycles.  The NMs are the legacy workhorse instruments for heliospheric physics.  Because of their simplicity, ruggedness, and tolerance for mis-adjustment, they have registered numerous transient phenomena, i.e., ground level enhancements (GLE) and Forbush decreases (FD) for more than a half century.  They have also been used to monitor the global galactic cosmic-ray intensity that has served as a measure of solar-induced heliospheric activity and has also been used to quantify the dynamics of the transport of cosmic rays within the heliosphere.  Conducting these measurements over several Solar Cycles, for example, revealed the 22-year charge-sign dependent heliospheric drift.  When treating the global network of NMs as a single magnetic spectrometer, the cosmic-ray spectrum of these phenomena can be measured from the atmospheric cutoff rigidity at high latitudes to almost 20 GV, the geomagnetic cut-off of the most equatorial station.  UNH owns and operates three stations in this network.  A fourth (Climax) is moribund, and a fifth (Maui), is irreparably decommissioned.  The intent of this project is to return the three operating UNH neutron monitors to a complete operational status and support their operation for one year.<br/><br/>This one-year RAPID project allows time-critical hardware fixes (controllers and barometers), data processing and recording, overdue maintenance and contractual arrangements with host organizations.  Of particular urgency is the full return of the Leadville station to supplant the data stream formerly produced by the Climax monitor.  These NM data, along with those of the other instruments in the global network, are critical to interpretation of spacecraft data and the collective measurements of GLEs.  Partially filled requests from other investigators for data from one or more of these instruments illustrates their importance to the system.  The project provides the means to bring all three stations up to standards by the end of 2018.  The three stations are important because they enable long-term cosmic-ray modulation studies with a data base dating back six solar cycles.  They are also important for GLE studies, providing ""ground truth"" for measurements such as PAMELA and AMS.  The PAMELA studies by the project team indicate that to fully appreciate and interpret space-based measurements, NM measurements are necessary.<br/><br/>This project helps support the non-profit Mount Washington Observatory, which is a meteorological and science resource for the entire New England community.  For the international community, it enables the spectrum analysis of GLEs with NMs during impulsive anisotropic phases of an event.  This is possible with the South Pole instruments, but the yield function of Polar PolarBARE is very different.

These storms can generate intense snowfall rates of several inches (5-10 cm) per hour, leading to accumulations of more than a meter of snow in the course of a day, and can be accompanied by near zero visibility, strong winds, bitter cold, and even thunders. This project will investigate lake-effect precipitation over the Great Lakes region of the Northeastern U.S.: a multi-scale phenomena combining strong synoptic and mesoscale forcing with fine convective-scale structures that present a prediction challenge. This research will contribute to the graduate theses and dissertations of multiple students, as well as provide material for classroom exercises on numerical weather prediction and effective use of ensemble data. <br/><br/>The NSF-sponsored Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign provides an excellent test environment for the evaluation of data assimilation techniques due to the rich observation dataset, including sounding systems, ground measurements, aircraft sensors, and mobile radars, as well as the rich, diverse scientific interests of a large group of collaborators investigating fundamental science. This project will implement and compare the most advanced four-dimensional ensemble and hybrid data assimilation systems, and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses for analysis and prediction of lake-effect snow. Radar products for winter weather will be assimilated, and their impact on timescales of predictability determined. Results will quantify the impacts of each observing system on forecast quality, establish the intrinsic and practical predictability of lake-effect snow, and assess the contributions of the lake surface boundary, model errors, and synoptic and mesoscale initial conditions and their underlying dynamics.<br/><br/>An additional broader impact is the development and evaluation of the best data assimilation techniques. This has the potential to provide guidance to operations as the nation moves toward a national convective scale ensemble. The next-generation regional operational prediction systems will require kilometer-scale convective-permitting model resolution and rapid updates ingesting all available observations using the most effective four-dimensional ensemble and/or hybrid data assimilation techniques. Improved forecast lead time and accuracy for lake-effect events will have positive societal impacts on residents of lake-effect prone regions. Reanalysis fields produced by this research are a vital component to the analyses of collaborators investigating the structure and evolution of lake-effect snow bands and the role of upstream lake-atmosphere interactions."

Koopman operators were derived in the early 1930s and used to prove an important theorem on the behavior of idealized dynamical systems. But they remained largely unknown beyond dynamical systems theory until the early 2000s, when their usefulness for complicated, data intensive problems was recognized. Since then, the idea of Koopman operators in combination with machine learning algorithms has been applied to various problems in fluid dynamics, stability analysis of power networks, the development of financial trading algorithms, and brain activity research. Like these applications, climate research is often data-driven and involves analysis of a complex system, thus Koopman operators could be a valuable addition to the climate research toolkit. <br/><br/>The advances in pattern extraction and predictive capabilities for complex systems stemming from this project will have great impacts in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems and will be applicable to various disciplines that deal with time-evolving phenomena, from climate science, fluid dynamics, to neuroscience and economics.

The team will apply the data-driven methods to climate simulations of El Nino Southern Oscillation to study the interactions of natural variability and forced response of the climate system.

It was once believed that only very explosive volcanic eruptions could affect the content of small particles in the stratospheric. However recent observations suggest that substantial volcanic enhancements of the stratospheric aerosol layer have occurred due to a series of smaller eruptions since about 2005. These eruptions have occurred just at the time when ozone recovery should be becoming more and more discernible. Volcanic aerosols have had major, well-documented effects on past changes in ozone, but have received only qualitative rather than quantitative attention in efforts to identify recovery to date. This research will advance the understanding of the sensitivity of ozone to changes in stratospheric aerosols and improve the basis for estimating uncertainty in ozone recovery. <br/><br/>A broad range of aerosol data since 2000 from satellite- and ground-based methods will be compared and used to improve the characterization of recent stratospheric aerosol changes and the uncertainties across different measurements. Data to be used include the CCMI (Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative) project aerosol data together with lidar data from distributed stations, satellite observations, and the University of Wyoming balloonsondes. The Specified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) will be used in the conduct of sensitivity tests to examine how uncertainties in kinetic rate constants, in background aerosol levels, and in variability of water vapor influence how volcanic surface area changes affect ozone depletion in the lowermost stratosphere, including the region close to the tropopause.<br/><br/>The largest stratospheric aerosol burden since 1991 was observed in 2011 following the Nabro eruption. At that time, reported column abundances of stratospheric aerosol at some locations and times reached as high as 30-50% of the maximum values obtained after Pinatubo. To date, the implications of these perturbations for mid-latitude and global ozone loss and recovery have not been assessed. Ensuring that the signature of chemical recovery can be fully understood is broadly acknowledged as a needed step in the comprehensive evaluation of scientific understanding and its role in the science-policy interface on this highly visible issue."

The goal of this investigation is to understand how the short-term variability that is observed in the ionosphere total electron content (TEC) during the September equinox may be explained as a result of the wave coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere regions. These TEC variations can be characterized as ionospheric weather that occur as a result of several dissipative processes that are supported by the coupling of large scale lower atmosphere waves to the ionospheric plasma of the region between 100 to 350 km. The key idea that would be studied in this award is based upon the fact that the transmission of large scale waves upward from the lower atmosphere region maximizes during the equinoctial period. Normally, the stratospheric winds would block these waves from reaching such high heights. However, the September equinox is when the direction of stratospheric winds reverses direction being eastward during winter and westward during the summer. During the equinox, these stratospheric winds are weak and then transmission of the large scale waves through the middle atmosphere region becomes possible. The investigation will compare modeled results for the oxygen composition, temperature, and plasma densities in the region of 100 to 350 km computed for the September equinoctial study to the satellite measurements of these quantities for this same period. An undergraduate student will be involved in the proposed research activities through the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program. The involvement of a SOARS student will serve to enhance participation of historically under-represented groups in the atmospheric sciences. The research will further benefit society through an improved understanding of short-term, day-to-day, variability in the ionosphere. Understanding this variability is critical due to the impact of the ionosphere on communication and navigation signals. <br/><br/>The modeling research would use numerical simulations of the plasma densities using a newly-developed, state-of-the-art whole atmosphere data assimilation model (WACCMX).  Incorporation of data assimilation in WACCMX will represent the first whole atmosphere model with a comprehensive ionosphere and thermosphere to include the data assimilation capability, enabling new insights into lower-upper atmosphere coupling during specific events. By employing a data assimilation whole atmosphere model, the numerical simulations can be directly compared with the observations.  This capability will be used to diagnose the mechanisms responsible for the observed variability. The realization of the proposal objectives will result in an overall improved understanding of the upper atmosphere variability that occurs using the September equinox transition as a representative simplified case study drawn from the overall range of upper atmosphere dynamics.  This simplification is a result of the weakness of stratospheric winds during the reversal period. The elimination of the need to know in detail the stratospheric winds thus enhances the ability to assess and measure the modeling capability to simulate the other physical processes ongoing in upper atmosphere dynamics."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation. Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes. More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate. Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this grant incorporate results from the campaign into their outreach to New Mexico high schools, in part through a class on weather and climate offered in the Masters of Science Teaching program at New Mexico Tech. They also develop materials for K-12 classroom teaching in their state. The project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research fellow, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight-week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights of the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar. Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. The PIs have developed a theory in which deep convection over warm oceans is controlled by three thermodynamic factors: heat and moisture coming from the underlying ocean, the ""saturation fraction"" of the atmospheric column (a kind of bulk relative humidity), and moist convective instability (with a counterintuitive association between weaker instability and heavier rainfall). But the theory assumes uniform atmospheric and oceanic conditions, and this assumption may not hold in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Instead, the region features a large north-south contrast in sea surface temperature (SST) accompanied by a narrow east-west convection band called the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sharp SST contrast provides an alternative explanation for ITCZ convection, as near-surface winds generally blow across the temperature contrast and converge over the warmer SSTs. Rising motion where low-level winds converge can produce convection, but the observed convection does not clearly match expectations based on SST contrast arguments.<br/><br/>A further issue involves the vertical structure of convective clouds, as convective clouds in the eastern Pacific ITCZ are relatively shallow yet they produce rain rates similar to their deeper counterparts over the western Pacific. The PIs have an explanation for the development of heavy rain from mid-depth convection which can be tested using campaign data. A further mystery is that satellite data from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) seem to show a large amount of stratiform rain in the eastern Pacific, even though high stratiform rain fraction is usually associated with the anvil cloud and decaying cloud plumes found in regions of deep convection. The PIs argue that cloud features identified as stratiform rain in TRMM data should instead be classified as weak cellular convection, thus removing the inconsistency between stratiform rain amounts and relatively shallow convection. The combination of dropsonde and airborne radar data should suffice to distinguish between stratiform rain clouds and weak cellular convection.<br/><br/>In contrast, SSTs in the southwest Caribbean are quite uniform so convection does not develop from SST-induced wind convergence. Moreover, mid-tropospheric air over the area is relatively dry and thus not conducive to convection and heavy rainfall.  Yet convection and heavy rainfall still occur, often associated with the passage of easterly waves. These waves appear on a weekly basis and sometimes cross Central America to reach the eastern Pacific.  But it is not clear whether the majority of easterly waves in the eastern Pacific come from the Caribbean or if they form locally.  These issues are also addressed in the campaign.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A conceptual understanding of such variations will be established though idealized numerical modeling experiments (NME). The concept developed will be used to analyze more realistic NME, investigating the weather and climate impacts of observed LULC changes (2000-2010) in the maritime continent, which exerts an important influence on tropical climate. Educational aspects of this project is the integration of Polaris, a discovery engine designed for operating on big data, with NME outputs generated from the Principal Investigator's (PI) research (past, ongoing and future) to transition from a deductive to inductive methodology for teaching of graduate level courses in Atmospheric Dynamics.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>LULC change can have a substantial impact on weather and climate, but varies in complex fashion depending upon geographical setting, especially terrain and continentality. A conceptual framework for understanding the geographic variability is gradually emerging from prior studies, including those of the PI. The research activities will lead to an important addition to this framework, namely the impact LULC change in the context of island settings, and improved understanding of the effect of deforestation in the maritime continent. Note that the influence of the maritime continent on tropical climate is disproportionate to its land area, contributing to 40% of latent heating in the global tropics (~twice compared to continental convection). A large portion occurs in the vicinity of small islands as sea breeze initiated convection and is potentially impacted by LULC changes. Thus the proposed research is relevant and important, especially in the context of the IPCC determination that radiative forcing caused by land-atmosphere interactions is not well quantified, and is one of the key uncertainties. Whereas tools for big data analysis are becoming more common in field of Atmospheric Science, incorporation of this capability in classroom settings is lacking. Analysis of large datasets to establish relationship between atmospheric variables relevant to a phenomenon, and inferring the nature of theoretical framework needed to analyze it is an effective method for teaching of Atmospheric Dynamics. Learning in such an inductive setting mimics the natural development of the field. However, the pedagogy required for this purpose is also lacking. The PI addresses these critical gaps through integration of his research and educational activities.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>The LULC change impacts could be exacerbating or mitigating the effects large scale climate trends in the maritime continent. For some island settings, deforestation could lead to decrease in rainfall over agricultural regions and thus the concern that increase in productivity gained from expanding the crop lands may be negated by reduced rainfall caused by deforestation. Thus the results from this study have the potential to inform and lead to better policy formulation regarding climate change mitigation and sustainable environmental management. Atmospheric dynamics is often a very difficult course for students in atmospheric science. The teaching method developed via this award has the potential to transition students from mimicry to mastery, improving research creativity and retention in graduate programs. The proposed educational portal will document and share the big data supported inductive pedagogy with a wider community, allowing continued evolution from other educators and students."

For the first time, our observational capabilities, with the unprecedented quality of the solar cycle worth of Wind electron data that we are producing, combined with a theoretical analysis will allow us to quantitatively connect electron thermodynamics in the solar wind and microphysical processes and better determine the role of electrons for the evolution of the solar wind.  This 3-year SHINE project is expected to improve present understanding of the physical processes that are relevant for the generation and evolution of the solar wind from a very fundamental plasma-physical perspective based on first principles.  It will also provide much needed input for the development of predictive physics-based solar-wind models.  Including more accurate description of electron physics in such models will lead to major improvements of our understanding of space-weather processes, the propagation of energetic-particle events, as well as the propagation of cosmic rays throughout the heliosphere.<br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project describes an integrated research program to study the microphysical processes that regulate the kinetic and non-thermal features of solar wind electrons, like the electron core and halo drifts, and the electron strahl structure.  It will investigate the micro-instabilities generated by drifts, heat flux and temperature anisotropy, as well as their contributions to solar wind turbulence.  The research will be based on in-situ observations of solar wind electron distribution functions, proton measurements, as well as magnetic field and plasma wave data from the Wind spacecraft.  A hot plasma dispersion solver will be used to determine the theoretical thresholds and growth rates of electron-driven micro-instabilities.<br/><br/>The electron microphysical processes addressed in this proposal have a broader application than the interplanetary medium, as they occur in the solar corona, the coronae of other stars and compact astrophysical objects, and in other more exotic environments in the universe such as jets and supernova blast waves.  Furthermore, the topic of electron microphysics in the solar wind and in space plasma is one of the primary science focus topics by the heliophysics community in the USA, in particular SHINE.  In the past, the project team has convened dedicated sessions at the NSF-funded SHINE Workshops in 2014 and 2015, which have received very positive feedback from the heliophysics community.  The investigators plan to continue to lead the focus group and the science discussions to foster more, multi-disciplinary, collaborations within the space physics community, involving theory, numerical simulations, observations and data analysis.  As part of this project, they propose a follow-up session at the 2016 SHINE Workshop.  This science topic is also of great importance in the preparation of the upcoming NASA mission Solar Probe Plus and ESA mission Solar Orbiter, one of their key science goals being to explore in-situ the fundamental microphysical plasma processes at the origin of the heating of the solar corona, acceleration of the solar wind and the evolution of the heliosphere including CMEs and transients.  This research project will foster a close work collaboration between the UC Berkeley and the UNH.  It will support two young researchers in early phases of their scientific careers and a graduate student at UC Berkeley.

Insufficient knowledge of aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation (via cloud modification) causes a large uncertainty in quantification of the overall climatic effects of aerosols and results in poor predictions on global climate models. These needs will be addressed through the analysis of aerosol-cloud interactions via three innovative research themes: (i) Remote sensing studies on the impact of aerosols on clouds and precipitation via the direct, indirect and semi-direct effects using A-Train Satellite data sets; (ii) Observational studies on mixing processes with investigations into aerosol-cloud interactions based on cloud size, lifetime and aerosol type and surface characteristics; and (iii) Model Evaluation of cloud-aerosol interactions using collocated A-Train Satellite observations to identify inconsistencies between observations and global climate models to guide future development and improvement in global climate models.<br/><br/>By utilizing three distinctly different data types this project allows for the analysis of aerosol-cloud interactions on a variety of spatial (individual clouds to global scale) and temporal scales (micro-seconds in cloud to yearly means). The variety of platforms used for this study will also provide graduate student researchers with an exceptionally broad background and varied skill set.<br/><br/>The research described above is closely intertwined with the education goals of this project. State-of-the-art research on clouds, aerosols and climate will be integrated into undergraduate courses to increase the overall scientific literacy of a ""hot"" media topic. The adoption of group class activities utilizing multi-media teaching techniques (i.e. YouTube and Podcasts) will encourage students to identify connections between the ""real world"" current weather events and climate issues with course material. Additionally, an innovative undergraduate-graduate student mentoring program will guide undergraduates while simultaneously developing supervising and mentoring skills in graduate students as they embark on the research outlined above. The research program will also foster collaborations between the University of Hawaii and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by providing graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to intern and work with elite scientists at a renowned research facility. To broadly impact the community the PI will organize an annual Expanding Your Horizon (EYH) conference in Hawaii (the first for that state). The PI will recruit local Hawaiian women scientists and industry leaders with the goal of educating and attracting young women to the STEM fields. As part of the EYH conference the PI will sponsor hands-on workshops using data collected through the described research efforts."

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to determine the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), aerosol particles which absorb water vapor from the air to form liquid water droplets that are collectively visible as clouds.  CCN abundances are assessed using two miniature CCN counters, or mCCNs, each weighing 1.5kg.  The mCCNs are diffusion chambers in which aerosols collected in clear air (meaning outside of clouds) are subjected to humidity values above the saturation level so that those which are able to serve as CCN at a given temperature and supersaturation form droplets which can be counted. One mCCN is operated at a constant supersaturation value which is representative of the mean supersaturation level in local clouds as determined by other instruments on the aircraft.  The mCCN has a 1Hz sampling rate so that it can be used to produce high-resolution CCN concentration profiles as the GV ascends and descends through the boundary layer, cloud layer, and free troposphere.  The other mCCN is operated at supersaturation levels which are adjusted over the range of supersaturation values expected in SO clouds, so that a full CCN spectrum (CCN concentration as a function of supersaturation) can be recorded over five minute sampling intervals during level flight.<br/><br/>Three hypotheses are addressed with the measurements, along with other campaign data:<br/><br/>1) Anthropogenic aerosols are transported over the SO in the free troposphere and mixed downward into the boundary layer during the passage of frontal weather systems. The balance between the injection of aerosols by downward mixing and their removal by rain events establishes a north-south gradient in aerosol and CCN concentration across the South Polar front.<br/><br/>2) Sea spray and continental transport determine aerosol and CCN properties over the SO, while the seasonal cycle of biological activity plays a larger role in aerosol-cloud interactions in the Antarctic coastal regions (south of 56 degrees);<br/><br/>3) Relatively small changes in CCN concentration over the SO has a profound impact on cloud microphysical properties as the sensitivity of cloud microphysical properties is high at these low aerosol concentrations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research. This project has educational benefits for undergraduate interns from the NSF-funded Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) center and a students from a local charter school, who will assist with calibration and operation of the instrumentation and data analysis.  In addition, the project support and trains a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

This would yield photometric studies of the Sun, which is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding solar variability.  The current solar cycle 24 demonstrates that solar variability is still unpredictable, and therefore requires continued measurement.  While absolute solar radiative flux is measured from space, solar images from ground-based telescopes are used to decipher information about the photospheric and chromospheric sources of variability.  The SFO and California State University at Northridge (CSUN) are well suited to continue to carry out long term photometric observations, while keeping costs low and employing undergraduate and graduate students, as well interested faculty.  The resulting data product will be a uniform photometric record of daily solar images in multiple wavelengths, eventually at least 50 years long, which will yield information needed to study active region contributions to solar irradiance across two or more Hale magnetic cycles.  The models to be developed with the new CFDT3 data will be used to: (1) provide support for space-based irradiance monitors; (2) characterize past and future variations in the amount of solar power reaching Earth; and, (3) gain deeper understanding of the physical sources of the Sun?s irradiance changes.  The SFO/CFDT photometry program records full-disk solar images at multiple wavelengths on all sunny days (about 65% of the year), and maintains an archive of metadata describing solar variability.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the SFO?s photometry program is four-fold: (1) maintain a fundamental scientific data set; (2) support space-based solar irradiance monitors; (3) generate secondary data of interest to the larger scientific community; and, (4) fulfill an educational mission.  Using the new data from CFDT3, the project team will reconstruct changes in the Sun?s total and spectral radiative output.  These reconstructions are a valuable tool for the solar irradiance research community: not only do they provide scientific information, but they also allow the identification of discontinuities in the space-based irradiance record that can help bridge gaps between spacecraft missions.  The analyses of solar variability are applicable to the study of other Sun-like stars.  A major impact is educating undergraduate and graduate students in observational solar physics.  California State University at Northridge is designated as an Hispanic Serving Institution and Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution.  Its pool of students reflects the ethnic diversity of its geographic area.  CFDT3 is a hands-on instrument that will entice and encourage students to explore and consider Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers.  Its accessibility allows for its integration into CSUN?s Physics and Astronomy curriculum at both graduate and undergraduate levels.  Public outreach efforts through CSUN planetarium presentations expose the ethnically diverse population of the San Fernando Valley to the possibilities of scientific research."

This clear sky location is ideally situated for making observations of the highly dynamical environment associated with the mountain waves generated by the surface winds blowing over the Andes. This location is also well suited for detecting sodium particles transported to high altitude by the Appleton fountain effect that operates near the geomagnetic equator. Both of these mechanisms make the Andes dynamical environment a ""hot spot"" that is unique in the world with nothing equivalent available for study in the United States.  ALO is an upper atmosphere observatory that supports optical remote sensing instruments, including a wind/temperature (W&T) lidar operating at the sodium wavelength (589 nm) and several airglow instruments. The lidar system measures simultaneously nighttime atmospheric wave perturbations (associated with gravity waves) of temperature, wind and airglow intensities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region (80-105 km) at high vertical spatial (<1 km) and temporal resolutions (~1 min) during the low moon period of each month. The MR data provides measurements of the background tidal winds that allow the determination of the intrinsic phase speeds needed for studying gravity wave propagation physics. These results taken together are aimed at achieving a detailed study of atmospheric waves and turbulence structures through modeling comparisons of data with turbulent structure morphology. This project will support engineering undergraduate students at ERAU thus helping to extend the STEM undergraduate education effort at ERAU into the remote sensing area.  One graduate and one undergraduate student would be directly involved in this project. Moreover, these applications made possible by the enhanced quality of the MR data would provide new opportunities for graduate student training in the radar remote sensing technology as well as having these students undertake studies regarding new questions in upper atmosphere research. Students involved will learn the principles of the MR remote sensing technique through the use of formal lectures and informal hands-on interactions. Activities involving the graduate student are site radar noise survey, the process of radar installation and subsequent hardware maintenance. The student would also be responsible for data retrieval, validation and archival processing. The undergraduate student would help set up the Madrigal server and update the ERAU website concerning the meteor radar status. These activities will provide training to these students on how to become an experimental scientist. The MR would also support undergraduate and graduate education at ERAU as the department offers an undergraduate course in Space Physics, one MS level course Experimental Methods in Space Science, and two PhD level courses Upper Atmosphere Physics and Remote Sensing: Active and Passive. Students will learn advanced techniques involved in MR and use the MR data for various course projects. Students can design their own software for meteor identification, wind and temperature retrieval. <br/><br/>The MR measures horizontal wind continuously (day and night) in the same altitude region as the height range observed by the lidar with ~2 km vertical and 1 hr resolutions. It complements the optical lidar measurements by providing background tidal wind information that is critical for deriving gravity wave (GW) intrinsic parameters and understanding the phenomenology of GW wave propagation with regard to reflection, ducting, and dissipation processes. The MR capability for continuous wind measurement is essential for resolving longer time scale oscillations such as atmospheric tides and planetary waves, and for the study of their interactions with small-scale waves. The new MR will not only continue the MR wind measurement series but also provides new capabilities to infer temperature, turbulence diffusion coefficient, and the diurnal variation of GW momentum flux.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When ice crystals form in clouds they tend to grow at the expense of liquid droplets, as water preferentially evaporates from droplets and condenses onto ice particles through the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process.  The PIs hypothesize that the persistence of SLW in SO clouds is due in part to a lack of ice nucleating particles (INPs), particles which trigger freezing within liquid droplets.  INPs are much less common than cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the particles onto which water vapor condenses to produce liquid droplets, as ice nucleation can only occur on particles which have a conducive crystalline structure.  Lack of INPs is a reasonable conjecture as many ice nucleating materials such as soil minerals and plant matter come from land and might thus be unavailable over the SO.  But ice nucleation can also be driven by fragments and splinters of ice from the breakup of graupel and other frozen precipitation particles, and the PIs hypothesize that this sort of ""secondary nucleation"" is hampered by factors including limited cloud depth, weak cloud updrafts, and low precipitation rates.<br/><br/>The examination of controls on the depth, amount, and longevity of SLW in SO clouds is conducted using several wing-mounted probes to characterize raindrops, cloud droplets, and ice particles.  Instruments including a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP), a two-dimensional cloud probe (2DC), and a 2-D stereo probe (2DS), are used to generate size distributions for particles from 25 microns to 2mm.  A Particle Habit Imaging and polar Scattering probe (PHIPS) is used to determine the shape of ice particles, and two additional probes are used to determine cloud  SLW content.  The wing-mounted probes are used along with data from inlet-based instruments to assess the relative importance of secondary ice formation compared with primary nucleation.  Data collected by airborne radar and lidar provides information on cloud ice particles and droplets on larger spatial scales as well as information on cloud updraft and downdraft strength.  Further work is performed using numerical models.<br/><br/>The campaign has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. In addition, the pristine conditions of the SO are the closest available analog to the pre-industrial atmosphere and thus campaign observations could be helpful in understanding the anthropogenic contribution to aerosols and aerosol-cloud interactions. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research. Educational broader impacts include the participation of three graduate students in campaign and post-campaign activities.  Several outreach activities are planned for the deployment, involving public speaking and tours of the aircraft.  Social media outreach is also planned, through blog postings, twitter, and a Facebook page."

Improvement of weather forecast models for hurricane landfalls will benefit hurricane preparation especially for the states along the coast lines, leading to reduced damages. <br/><br/>A team of researchers at Colorado State University and University of Texas at Arlington will work together with a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow to collect and compile near-surface wind data from in situ, radar, and satellite observations present along the North Carolina coast, and in particular the areas surrounding Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, which encompasses the downstream estuaries of Chowan River, Pamlico River, and Neuse River, and was impacted by both Florence and Michael. In addition, they will use satellite observations in combination of the surface hydrological observations to estimate surface roughness changes. By comparing spatial variations of surface roughness changes and wind, they will investigate flood-rainfall-wind interactions. The significance of the interaction and the magnitude of the surface roughness change between pre-inundation and maximum inundation will provide useful information on whether these factors will be included in numerical forecast models for hurricane landfalls. <br/><br/>The study will recover and maintain time-critical wind data sets especially datasets in private sectors which are often not well maintained or broadcasted. The investigators will engage science community and agencies through meetings and web broadcast, and educating and training a graduate student and a post-doc research associate on conducting researches. The team will publish the data set in the CSU web portal, present their results at science conferences, work with agencies, in particular NOAA, to ensure that the forecasters are aware of the availability of the dataset.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest is the coupling of the lower atmosphere to the ionized layer near 100-150 km that is called the ""dynamo region"". Large-scale wave variations of winds and temperatures in the lower atmosphere that are called thermal tides are generated by the heating caused by the daily passage of the Sun overhead or by the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor or stratospheric ozone at tropical latitudes. Other large-scale waves called planetary waves (PW) may also be caused by weather activity within the lower atmosphere. These large-scale waves may have periodicities as long as 16 days and very large horizontal wavelengths (thousands of km).  These waves will propagate to higher altitudes where the winds, ionized gas content, and Earth?s magnetic field interact to generate electric fields and currents.  These, in turn, will induce magnetic field perturbations that may be measured by the global network of magnetometers (141 sites). The production of PW and tidal waves within the lower atmosphere is highly variable, and consequently, the winds and temperature profiles associated with these wave structures will exhibit significant variability from day-to-day that can be detected through the application of sophisticated analysis procedures to the global magnetometer data.  Part of the research motivation for this approach is that the electric fields generated within the dynamo region will map upward into the ionosphere above 250 km and generate variability of electron density at high altitudes that need to be understood for successful space weather forecasting, which has been given national priority. The research supported by this award would determine the ionospheric variability using the magnetometer data to measure the meridional and zonal components of magnetic field variations relative to a steady state baseline. The origins of this variability can then be considered in regard to possible factors to identify causal relationships. The award represents a strong potential for exciting and transformative science because the global analysis of ground magnetometer data will provide new insights into atmosphere-ionosphere coupling by tides and PW in a way that cannot be achieved by any satellite-based series of observations that is limited by the nature of local time sampling of the ionospheric variability.  The broader impact of this award is that a woman Egyptian graduate student would be supported in her PhD work in this award thus enhancing the cultural diversity of the aeronomy community.<br/><br/>The science motivation for this award is summarized by the following list of physical processes that need to be fully understood to understand space weather variability: (1) The dynamo region (ca.100-150 km) of Earth?s atmosphere is where electric fields are mainly generated through the dynamo action of neutral winds during daytime; (2) These electric fields have profound influences on the variability of the whole ionosphere; (3) Dynamo region variability is thought to originate from solar flux influences on electrical conductivity, and from the variability imposed by tidal and PW neutral winds, and disturbance winds associated with geomagnetic activity; (4) This variability has never been observationally quantified globally in a systematic way; (5) Knowledge concerning the variability of the dynamo region provides insight into the sources of variability for the overlying ionosphere; and (6) A global array of ground magnetometers exists that can provide the above knowledge.  Examination of the global magnetometer data through application of standard time-series analysis tools would seek to understand the cause-effect factors underlying the ionospheric variability with the focus being that a major fraction of this ionospheric variability is likely to be caused by the large-scale waves reaching into this region from below. These results would be compared with variations of the standard solar and magnetic field indices to search for evidence of causal relationships between the tides and PW excited in the lower atmosphere and whose influences extend into the 100-150 km dynamo region generate electric fields that then map along magnetic field lines into the F region ionosphere. The F-region plasma redistributions that they produce carry with them the spatial and temporal signatures of these tides and PW, and of the processes that produced or modified them at lower altitudes."

Improvements in our understanding of the atmospheric and space sciences rely on the use of both ground- and space-based observations.  In addition to providing insights into many complex environmental processes and trends, these observations can also be used to evaluate the performance of regional/global climate models, ecosystem-level models, and space weather models, each of which represent our best theoretical descriptions of these processes.  These observations and models are used to protect human health and welfare in a number of ways, ranging from aiding in the development of adaptation strategies to protect community infrastructure in a changing climate, to allowing for the prediction of the timing and intensity of solar storm interactions with our atmosphere, which have the potential to impact communications and our nation's power grid.  Through the introduction of the students to topics such as measurement design, quality assurance and control, data analysis and presentation, model development and evaluation, and assessment and communication of scientific uncertainties, this project will seek to produce scientifically and ethically responsible future scientists, while improving the overall self-efficacy of these students regarding their continued participation in STEM fields."

The ionosphere affects modern technologies such as civilian and military communications and navigation and surveillance systems.  Reliable communication and navigation, therefore, often requires correction of the signals for effects imposed by the ionosphere. To do that the properties of the ionosphere, such as its variability with respect to magnetospheric disturbance, time of day, season of the year, and solar cycle variability must be well understood and modeled.     The fundamental measurements of IT-SPINS are high-sensitivity line-of-sight observations of Ultra Violet nightglow radiance produced by the recombination of Oxygen ions with electrons in the upper ionosphere.   IT-SPINS will rotate at two rotations per minute about the orbit normal and will acquire 60 radiance measurements per revolution.  Observations from several rotations will then be combined in a tomographic inversion algorithm to produce two-dimensional altitude/in-track images of the emissions.   In this way, IT-SPINS will provide the first-ever set of unambiguous, geographically-extended measurements of the Oxygen ion distributions within the nightside ionosphere.  Specifically, IT-SPINS will provide crucial information on the ion gradient structures in the, so-called, Topside Transition Region, from approximately 500km to 1000km altitude, where a transition takes place in the plasma conditions from being dominated by Oxygen ions to being dominated by Hydrogen ions. Prior studies of the TTR have primarily used large incoherent scatter radars at only a few locations around the World. Consequently, a thorough climatological study of the TTR's dependence on latitude, local time, and solar and geomagnetic activity does not exist at present. Lacking fundamental understanding of the variability of the TTR and the detailed morphology of Oxygen ion distributions throughout the TTR is a critical limitation currently in our ability to accurately model and predict ionospheric variability.   <br/><br/>Beyond fundamental space weather objectives, the IT-SPINS project places a significant priority on experimental learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education at the university undergraduate level. Undergraduate students will participate in responsible roles on all aspects of the project.  This provides the students with rare and valuable opportunities to learn and practice project management; systems engineering; engineering design, development and testing; and flight operations and data analysis skills through first-hand, project-based learning while being mentored by faculty and professional staff. In addition, through affiliation with the statewide Montana Space Grant Consortium (MSGC), the project will engage traditionally disadvantaged students at MSGC affiliated Tribal Colleges with IT-SPINS operational activities during the orbital phase.  <br/><br/>IT-SPINS can achieve compelling science results over a wide range of available orbit inclinations (>40 degrees) and altitudes (500-700 km). This altitude range puts us at optimal viewing of the TTR above, and plasma structures below the satellite while ensuring a 25-year de-orbit criteria. The following primary and secondary science objectives and derived science questions are designed so that a subset of them can be addressed by IT-SPINS regardless of the satellite orbit it will be given. The primary science objective for the mission is to study the variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles.  The following three questions will be addressed: 1) How does the altitude and thickness of the boundary between O+ dominated ionospheric physics and H+, He+ dominated plasmasphere physics vary as a function of magnetic L-shell, magnetic longitude, local time and geomagnetic activity?  2) How well do Geospace numerical models predict the observed variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles? 3) What is the importance of the charge exchange between O+ and neutral hydrogen to the TTR?   Imaging the mesoscale structuring of equatorial plasma bubbles and polar cap patches constitutes a secondary science objective for the mission. The equatorial part of the secondary science objective can be addressed by both mid- and high inclination orbits, whereas the polar patch part can only be addressed for high inclination orbits (~70 degrees or higher)."

The successful modeling of cirrus coverage, cloud evolution, and response to a changing climate has been limited by fundamental uncertainties in the microphysics of the constituent ice particles.  Important questions remain regarding cirrus ice particle nucleation, growth and sublimation efficiency, and particle morphology.  This project will address two of these fundamental uncertainties through novel use of modern nanotechnology tools.  First, do ice crystal facets in cirrus clouds exhibit roughened surfaces at the nanoscale and microscale, and if so, what factors affect the degree and character of roughening? Secondly, does the presence or absence of roughened surfaces alter predicted rates of water vapor-ice phase exchange?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Improved modeling of cirrus clouds is of widely acknowledged strategic importance for climate modeling, and there is broad agreement that a paucity of laboratory measurements of ice microphysics is among the most significant constraints on progress.  Aircraft probes and cloud chambers are making advances, but one avenue of potential discovery remains largely untapped: modern materials imaging and analysis tools have yet to be fully applied to ice surfaces under atmospherically relevant conditions.  Such analysis can be expected to reveal new information about ice crystal surface structures and kinetics. Preliminary data acquired by Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) have already demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of ice surface roughness in lab-grown crystals, and revealed growth rates that deviate from classical predictions.  However, the ice crystals already analyzed by ESEM have been made on a substrate in a pure vapor environment; the relevance of these findings to the atmosphere cannot be fully established without a revised experimental approach.  This project aims to address this question head-on by conducting laboratory experiments under gaseous conditions more representative of the atmosphere and through balloon-borne capture, retrieval, and analysis of actual cirrus particles.  Successful completion of the project will firmly establish the character of surface roughness on cirrus particles, contribute to improved modeling of vapor deposition/sublimation, and provide the clearest, highest-resolution images of cirrus ice particles ever acquired.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This project will be conducted by physics department faculty and students at a primarily undergraduate institution, The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), in Ewing, NJ.  Undergraduate research has proven to be a highly effective tool for recruiting outstanding students into careers in the field of atmospheric science.  Largely because of the relative scarcity of undergraduate programs, the atmospheric sciences lag behind other natural sciences in developing this pipeline. This project will help to more firmly establish atmospheric science within the physics department at TCNJ, a large and growing department.  By providing cutting-edge research opportunities to outstanding physics undergraduates, the project will pave the way for an under-utilized path into careers in atmospheric science.  In addition, during each year, two of the undergraduate researchers in the program will be dual science/secondary education students who will carry the excitement of scientific discovery into their high school classrooms.  These future teachers will engage high school students from the high-need school districts of Trenton and Ewing, New Jersey in inquiry-centered laboratory experiences based on the scientific questions being addressed in the proje"

The project is a collaborative effort, led by UC Berkeley and with participation also from Stanford University and Lockheed-Martin.  The objective is to develop a data-driven Coronal Global Evolution Model (CGEM) to use observations of the evolving photospheric magnetic field to drive a time-dependent model of the coronal magnetic field, with the aims of both understanding how solar eruptive events work and predicting such events. The model's Earth-facing hemisphere will be driven using electric fields derived from the observed evolution of photospheric line-of-sight magnetic fields and electric currents. Far-side data inputs will be from an existing flux transport code, combined with helioseismological far-side observations of new active regions, with empirical parameterizations of orientation and flux. Because this model includes large-scale coronal electric currents, it is a substantial improvement over existing real-time global coronal models, which assume potential fields. Data products available from the model include: 1) the evolving photospheric electric field, Poynting flux, and helicity flux; 2) estimates of coronal free energy and non-potential geometry and topology; 3) initial and time-dependent boundary conditions for MHD modeling of active regions; and 4) time-dependent boundary conditions and flux tube expansion factors for MHD and empirical solar wind models.<br/><br/>When completed, the CGEM Model will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) for global runs on demand at moderate resolution for use by the general science community. Modules used to derive surface electric fields from magnetic evolution will be run continuously at lower resolution at the Stanford/Lockheed Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) for general use by the scientific community. As the JSOC serves as the main repository and distribution node for data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite mission, CGEM output will be readily available to members of the solar-physics and space-weather communities as a tool for both scientific research and space weather applications. The build-up and release of magnetic free energy in the corona is one the most important manifestations of solar eruptive activity, and the model will improve the forecast of these events, which is highly relevant to National space weather goals."

Unlike existing arrays, RAPID can be operated without any cabling between the antennas and a central location, and can be shipped, deployed and physically reconfigured quickly and easily with zero site infrastructure. This creates a unique capability to locate and configure an imaging radio interferometer array, highly customized to the specific science goal of any given field campaign, thereby supporting science investigations that hitherto have not been feasible.

With its broad frequency coverage and the ability to customize the array layout to match the spatial scales in powerful solar coronal emissions of various kinds, RAPID will greatly advance solar imaging capabilities at these frequencies, shedding new light on a region intimately linked with space weather phenomena. The reconfigurability and excellent imaging properties of RAPID will enable all-sky maps of the Galactic synchrotron background emission with superior angular resolution compared to current data, while also incorporating high precision broadband spectral data spanning a decade in frequency. The RAPID system also offers the capability of studying intense nanosecond-scale pulses from cosmic ray airshowers, capturing full amplitude and phase information in response to external triggers, with user-selected aperture sampling, and with easy portability to the location of existing particle observatories. The project will introduce important innovations to the radio measurement community, and provide a technical foundation for subsequent development of larger, more powerful instruments of this type. We will bring together leading edge technologies and techniques from multiple branches of radio astronomy, the geospace radar community, and a rapidly advancing high-tech industry to create a truly portable system with unique capabilities for the detailed study of strong radio signals. The project also features extensive education and training opportunities for students and teachers through the NSF REU and RET programs, and the diverse science topics it addresses which can be communicated to the general public with a connecting theme of radio signals.

Scientific predictions are improving rapidly, and information and communication technology has dramatically changed how people access, combine, and share information.  Yet existing paradigms for hazard preparedness and warning provide limited knowledge and tools for understanding how forecast and warning information is communicated and used. To address this gap, this project will investigate how interactions among different sources and types of information influence risk interpretations and behavioral responses as a hurricane approaches and comes onshore, in the context of evolving meteorological predictions and modern information-delivery systems.  This project brings together concepts, methods, and expertise from computer and information science, atmospheric and related sciences, and social and behavioral sciences to address three research questions:  (1) How does evolving information about hurricane risk propagate through the information system as a hurricane approaches? (2) How does communication of risk in the modern information environment alleviate or exacerbate societal vulnerability to hurricanes in general, and of the most vulnerable members of the public in particular?; and (3) Given ongoing developments in science and technology, how can hurricane forecast and warning information and its communication be improved?  These questions will be investigated by integrating the study of the real-world hazard information system with computational physical and social modeling.  Researchers will collect and analyze data from social media streams, interviews, and focus groups that include an emphasis on more vulnerable populations.  This research will be combined with high-resolution ensemble hurricane and storm-surge modeling, as well as experiments in a computational laboratory that couples the hurricane and storm surge modeling with agent-based modeling of social actors who pursue, process, and transmit such information.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this effort rests both in advancement of fundamental knowledge in each sub-discipline and in forging new connections among disciplines to address integrative questions in hazards research.  The social media, interview, and focus group research will build new understanding of how hazard information from different sources, in the digital and non-digital spheres, is accessed, combined, interpreted, and acted upon.  This work will also advance vulnerability science by combining theory from several fields to examine how risk communication, information and communication technology, and social networks influence vulnerability and adaptive capacities as a hazard approaches.  Associated weather and storm surge modeling research will build fundamental understanding about coupled probabilistic hurricane and storm surge forecasting and the predictability of storm surge across lead times.  Scenarios derived from the output of this modeling will be used to develop visual risk communication prototypes that combine geospatial physical and societal information in new ways.  Coupled hurricane/agent-based modeling experiments will enable a novel exploration of information system dynamics and emergent behaviors in a controlled setting.  Through integration  across research components, this project will build new understanding of how physical sciences, social and behavioral sciences, and human-centered computing can join to transform hazard risk communication and help prevent hazards from becoming disasters.<br/><br/>Relative to Broader Impacts, findings from this project are expected to be of utility to operational weather and storm surge forecasters, public officials, emergency practitioners, media personnel, and members of the public to improve how they create and communicate information about approaching hurricane risks.  These improvements will motivate actions to reduce harm from hurricanes, enhance capacities, reduce vulnerabilities, and over time contribute to increased sustainability.  These findings will also be applicable to other hazards for which there is some predictive skill. To promote application of findings, the project includes collaborations with practitioner partners in the hurricane forecasting, emergency management, media, and digital volunteer communities.  The project will also cross-train senior and postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in interdisciplinary approaches and methods, helping to build an interdisciplinary workforce capable of solving the complex issues of hazard resilience and sustainability."

Lacking fundamental understanding of the variability of the TTR and the detailed morphology of Oxygen ion distributions throughout the TTR is a critical limitation currently in our ability to accurately model and predict ionospheric variability.   <br/><br/>Beyond fundamental space weather objectives, the IT-SPINS project places a significant priority on experimental learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education at the university undergraduate level. Undergraduate students will participate in responsible roles on all aspects of the project.  This provides the students with rare and valuable opportunities to learn and practice project management; systems engineering; engineering design, development and testing; and flight operations and data analysis skills through first-hand, project-based learning while being mentored by faculty and professional staff. In addition, through affiliation with the statewide Montana Space Grant Consortium<br/>(MSGC), the project will engage traditionally disadvantaged students at MSGC affiliated Tribal Colleges with IT-SPINS operational activities during the orbital phase.  <br/><br/>IT-SPINS can achieve compelling science results over a wide range of available orbit inclinations (>40 degrees) and altitudes (500-700 km). This altitude range puts us at optimal viewing of the TTR above, and plasma structures below the satellite while ensuring a 25-year de-orbit criteria. The following primary and secondary science objectives and derived science questions are designed so that a subset of them can be addressed by IT-SPINS regardless of the satellite orbit it will be given. The primary science objective for the mission is to study the variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles.  The following three questions will be addressed: 1) How does the altitude and thickness of the boundary between O+ dominated ionospheric physics and H+, He+ dominated plasmasphere physics vary as a function of magnetic L-shell, magnetic longitude, local time and geomagnetic activity?  2) How well do Geospace numerical models predict the observed variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles? 3) What is the importance of the charge exchange between O+ and neutral hydrogen to the TTR?   Imaging the mesoscale structuring of equatorial plasma bubbles and polar cap patches constitutes a secondary science objective for the mission. The equatorial part of the secondary science objective can be addressed by both mid- and high inclination orbits, whereas the polar patch part can only be addressed for high inclination orbits<br/>(~70 degrees or higher)."

Students will be shown the linkages between components of the atmospheric system that are important in studies of climate, aerosols and air quality. Students will have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for conducting field, laboratory and modeling research in the atmospheric sciences. They will explore the need for high quality data that can be obtained from measurements and which leads to reliable climate and air quality model predications. This REU site will make extensive use of an online Learning Management System (LMS) and e-Portfolios to foster collaboration before, during and after the ten-week summer session. Within this dynamic research environment students will conduct meaningful research projects that address important topics in the atmospheric sciences related to air quality and environmental change. Robust evaluation of this program will contribute to the development of improved REU models for mentoring rural and Native American students from community colleges and small four-year colleges.<br/><br/>The project's specific goals are to (1) recruit a diverse set of ten undergraduates annually, targeting rural and Native American students; (2) increase participants' knowledge of atmospheric and laboratory science; (3) enhance students' academic and professional-technical development; (4) increase motivation and self-efficacy to continue in STEM education and careers; (5) build supportive networks and student identification with science; and (6) increase STEM retention. This REU experience was intentionally designed by a multidisciplinary project team to familiarize students with the culture of science and to develop skills transferable to STEM and varied careers, including technical writing, research ethics, numerical and statistical analysis, hardware development, and effective communication to professional and general audiences. The atmospheric system is dynamic and complex. The study of the atmospheric system requires researchers to develop state-of-the-art tools for observation and modeling; these activities ensure the continued advancement of knowledge about the processes that force and regulate the atmosphere's synoptic and planetary circulation, air quality, weather and climate. It is therefore of the utmost importance to sustain the pool of human resources required for excellence in synoptic and global atmospheric dynamics, air quality and climate research."

Fabry-Perot observations of upper atmospheric hydrogen Balmer-alpha emissions from Northern mid-latitudes over the time period spanning three solar minima establish a reference data set that can be used to compare with future observations and with atmospheric models. This data set shows an apparent upward trend in hydrogen optical emissions of greater magnitude than predicted alone from increases in hydrogen abundance due to the rise in greenhouse gases. In order to ensure that this is not a result of a calibration artifact, the accuracy of the Northern hemisphere long-term Balmer-alpha data set will be improved through use of updated knowledge of the background Galactic emission intensity, current analysis tools, and an updated tropospheric scattering correction code. In addition, observations from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere will be compared.<br/> <br/>The major science questions to be addressed by this project are as follows: What are the solar cyclic and climatic influences on mechanisms governing lower to upper atmospheric coupling of hydrogenous species? What are the solar cyclic and possibly longer-term trends in emission observations from geocoronal hydrogen, the upper boundary of the Earth's hydrogenous species distribution? What are the predicted magnitudes for changes in hydrogen-containing species? To address this, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) will be used to carry out sensitivity studies of solar cyclic and climatic influences on middle and upper atmospheric hydrogeneous species distributions. The NCAR Global Mean Model will be used to study how these forcings propagate through the thermosphere.<br/><br/>A faculty member at a two-year UW college campus and undergraduate students will be involved in this work. Public outreach activities will be carried out aimed at increasing public literacy about the science of climate change, and facilitating opportunities for youth exposure and involvement in the sciences."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the PI performs science outreach through the Expanding Your Horizons program, which conducts a one-day conference for about 300 middle school girls, giving them the opportunity to explore careers that use math and science.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  There are convincing arguments that rising motions associated with heavy rainfall in the ITCZ should have a bottom-heavy vertical profile, meaning that the bulk of the rising motion in clouds occurs in the lower and middle troposphere.  But the idea of a bottom-heavy profile is contradicted by satellite observations (from the NASA TRMM mission) which appear to show a large fraction of stratiform precipitation.  Such precipitation typically falls from upper-level clouds in regions of widespread convection characterized by a top-heavy profile of rising motion.  In this project OTREC campaign data is used to resolve the vertical profile contradiction and test an alternative interpretation of the satellite data.<br/><br/>A further issue is the extent to which convection in the ITCZ is driven by the near-surface wind convergence in the region.  Some argue (see for example AGS-1758603) that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is largely due to thermodynamic factors associated with stability and energy balance, with near-surface convergence playing a secondary role. Here the PI hypothesizes that the thermodynamic arguments are not sufficient and the wind convergence plays a dominant role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The idea behind the project is that the EU grant will supply the science instruments and a joint launch for all 50 satellites, which will be provided by participating teams that will secure their own independent funding for CubSat production and ground station operation.  The plan for QB50 is that all 50 CubeSats will be launched together in 2015-2016 on a Shtil-2.1 from Murmansk in northern Russia into a circular orbit at 320 km altitude, inclination 79. Due to atmospheric drag, the orbits will decay and the CubeSats will be able to explore all layers of the lower thermosphere without the need for on-board propulsion, down to 90 or 100 km, depending on the quality of their thermal design. It is expected that the network will spread around the Earth (in a single orbit plane) providing a range of spacing and temporal revisit times. The lifetime of the CubeSats from deployment until atmosphere re-entry will be less than three months.

Waves which are broad (horizontal wavelengths spanning several degrees latitude) but shallow (vertical wavelengths of about one to four kilometers), generated by large areas of tropical convection, are the subject of this investigation.  These waves are of interest for three reasons: first, the waves can induce the formation of cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the transition zone between the troposphere and stratosphere that extends from about 14km to 18.5km.  TTL cirrus can form as rising air motions associated with the waves depress air temperatures and cause water vapor to freeze out as cirrus ice crystals.  The resulting clouds may be too thin to see from the ground or from satellites, yet they have an important climatic effect as they trap outgoing infrared radiation and thus warm the atmosphere.  The prevalence of such clouds is difficult to quantify, and the relative importance of wave motions as a source of TTL cirrus, in comparison to cirrus formation due to outflow of ice particles from deep cumulus clouds, is not known.<br/><br/>Second, the freezing out of water vapor by wave-induced temperature depression could be an important constraint on the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere.  The TTL is sometimes referred to as the ""gateway to the stratosphere"", as most of the water vapor in the stratosphere over the entire globe enters through the TTL.  The stratosphere is extremely dry compared to the troposphere, but stratospheric water vapor is nevertheless important as it has a relatively strong greenhouse effect and can lead to the formation of the polar stratospheric clouds which are key to the formation of the ozone hole.<br/><br/>Third, waves can transport momentum from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and wave momentum transport is the primary driver of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), an alternation between easterly and westerly winds occurring over the global tropics with a cycling time in excess of two years. While the QBO is narrowly confined to the low-latitude stratosphere, it can influence weather and climate worldwide through its effects on prominent modes of climate variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation.  While the theory of wave momentum transport is well established, uncertainties remain as to the relative importance of different wave types in driving the QBO, and current weather and climate models have difficulty in simulating it.<br/><br/>This project seeks to improve understanding of waves in the TTL by building and launching a balloon-borne instrument which receives positioning signals from satellites of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, which includes the GPS satellites launched by the US).  The GNSS signals are refracted as they pass through the atmosphere, and the amount of refraction can be used to infer air temperature in the upper troposphere.  Because the profiles are retrieved from the rising and setting, or occultation, of the GNSS satellites relative to the receiver, the balloon-borne instrument has the acronym ROC, for Radio OCcultation.<br/><br/>ROC is developed for use on balloons flow as part of the Strateole-2 field campaign organized by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, and the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamic (LMD) of the University of Paris-Saclay. Strateole-2 is a five-year campaign, with a small validation deployment in 2018 and full science deployments in 2020-2021 and 2022-2023. Balloons are launched from the Seychelles (about 5S in the Indian Ocean), with the expectation that each balloon will circle the earth for up to 90 days and observe the TTL between 20S and 15N. This award supports US participation in the validation campaign and the first full science deployment, along with post-campaign analysis. It is one of three awards made to US PIs for participation in Strateole-2, the full set being AGS-1643022, AGS-1642277/1642246, and AGS-1642650/1653644. <br/><br/>ROC is oriented to retrieve signals from GNSS satellites on either side of the balloon flight path, with observations taken between 8km and the flight level of about 20km and a vertical resolution between 200m and 250m. The observing geometry is such that observations at lower levels are farther away from the balloon, so that observations at 18, 15, and 12km altitude correspond to distances of roughly 100, 200, and 300km on either side of the balloon.  The waves of interest have periods from hours to days and ROC can record two to three occultations per hour.  Thus the three-dimensional structure of the waves is captured by the ROC measurements as the balloon advances along its trajectory.<br/><br/>ROC is accompanied by two other instruments which provide complementary observations.  One is the Balloonborne Cloud Overshoot Observation Lidar (BeCOOL), provided by the Laboratoire Atmospheres, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS, a laboratory of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace) in collaboration with CNES.  The lidar provides measurements of cirrus clouds which can be combined with ROC observations to examine the role of wave motions in generating cirrus clouds.  The other is the Temperature SENsor (TSEN), an instrument from LMD which records atmospheric temperature and pressure at the gondola.  Gondola displacements are precisely determined by ROC, and TSEN observations are used to factor out gondola movement relative to the ambient wave motion (these are super-pressure balloons which fly at a level of constant density).  The displacement data are then used to estimate the wave momentum flux at flight level associated with the large-scale waves observed by ROC.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the value of the observations for addressing a variety of questions regarding the effect of wave motions on TTL clouds, stratospheric humidity, and the QBO.  Observations collected in this project will be made available to the research community from servers at the  Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado so that they can be freely examined by the research community. The project also engages undergraduate students through a research class, offered simultaneously at the University of California San Diego, the University of Arizona (UA), and the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), in which students design a research project based on a test flight of ROC.  The class is followed by undergraduate research internships at UCSD, UA, the Research Experiences in Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESESS) program at UNAVCO (the University NAVSTAR Consortium, dedicated to applying GNSS technology to earth science), and the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Beyond these broader impacts, the project supports two graduate students."

The National Science Foundation (NSF) GEM program is a cornerstone of NSF's Magnetospheric Physics Program which supports the study of the physics of the magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind. The GEM program focuses on the development of global magnetospheric models. The success of this effort depends on open cooperation and exchange of ideas and the development and sharing of models. Through various data-model challenges, models are compared and validated in an open and constructive process. The means of achieving the open communication and cooperation required for GEM lies largely in the regular GEM workshops. This workshop award supports the science of the program by providing an opportunity for Principal Investigators (PIs) and students present results and discuss outstanding issues in an interactive setting. There are two GEM workshops each year: the week-long GEM Summer workshop in June which includes a student day and the one-day Mini-GEM workshop in December which is held the Sunday before the American Geophysical Union's Fall meeting. This award provides coordination support for both GEM workshops and travel support for approximately 75 students to attend the Summer workshop. <br/><br/>Basic research in magnetospheric physics is a critical component of the National Space Weather Action Plan and associated efforts. The magnetosphere is the dynamic force field protecting Earth from Solar radiation. Space Weather impacts on Earth occur in and propagate through the magnetosphere. The severity of the impacts depends on the condition of the magnetosphere at the time of impact. Scientific modeling of the magnetosphere is critical for building the tools that can transition to operationally relevant models. Another very important component of the GEM workshops is a strong student-oriented educational element. The majority of this award is for support of student participation in the GEM Summer workshops. Most of the student support is directed toward graduate students but may also toward very talented undergraduate students (attending a U.S. university). In large part, the GEM workshops act to mentor the students and facilitate the transition from student to researcher in the science community. Students have the opportunity to participate fully in the focus group sessions and to present their research in poster sessions that enable detailed discussion and interaction with the broader magnetospheric community. The GEM student organization has been formalized with student leaders and a student-only meeting including tutorial lectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching objective to investigate the gravity wave-driven coupling between the terrestrial atmosphere and the lower thermosphere/ ionosphere. In-situ instrumentation will measure the perturbations the waves produce in both neutral and ion densities at F-region heights, while on-board photometers will simultaneously measure the wavelengths and amplitudes of the wave fields in the upper mesosphere. Subsequent modeling coupled with meteorological data will reveal the connections between tropospheric storms and the MLTI system using state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques that include the effects of wave dissipation. The ionospheric ion density and temperature will be measured in-situ via the retarding potential analysis (RPA) technique.  The electronics for the RPA will be built at Virginia Tech, but will involve only minor modifications to the flight proven UT Dallas design.  The in-situ upper atmospheric neutral gas density will be measured by two distinct sensors: a traditional Bayard-Alpert (BA) ion gauge provided by the Aerospace Corporation, and new, diamond-like carbon (DLC) microtip-based gauge design that is better adapted to the power constraints of a CubeSat mission.  The University of Illinois will provide a suite of nadir-viewing photometers to measure perturbations in the O2 (0-0) Atmospheric (A) and O2 Herzberg I (HI) band airglow emissions in the 90-100 km region during the nighttime portion of the orbit.<br/><br/>This mission is the first of its kind; no previous satellite experiment has ever been devoted to identifying causal gravity wave links between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, and no previous experiment has systematically mapped active gravity wave regions at low and middle latitudes through direct observation of their ionospheric effects.  These waves are a vitally important but under-explored facet of atmospheric physics.  They strongly influence the dynamics of the media through which they travel by modifying the structure of the atmosphere at altitudes well above their source regions, and they may seed the development of plasma instabilities that scintillate and disrupt radio propagation.  The fundamental science goals of the experiment are to: 1) systematically observe gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths at lower F-region heights, and correlate on a global scale remotely-sensed wave-induced airglow perturbations in the upper mesosphere with in-situ measurements of ion and neutral density fluctuations at higher altitudes, and 2) produce global maps of active gravity wave regions in the mid- and low-latitude ionosphere over multiple seasons at all local times, so that global patterns and climatological variations can be quantitatively compared to and correlated with terrestrial weather systems via modeling.  The challenging cubesat mission is a high-risk effort but one with immensely high potential pay-off in providing a unique observational dataset of fundamental thermosphere and ionosphere parameters and related cutting-edge scientific findings.  <br/><br/>Active collaborations between engineering students at Virginia Tech and the University of Illinois will be established during the design, fabrication, integration, and environmental testing of the LAICE payloads and spacecraft; at least 60 undergraduates will participate in one or more phases of the development work, and in subsequent data analysis activities.  Strong collaboration will occur between the schools in instrumentation systems, satellite communications, and data analysis. Facilities at both institutions will be used to test, integrate, and calibrate spaceflight hardware, and results will be presented at annual small-spacecraft conferences.  All data and scientific findings that flow from the experiment will be made publicly available via a web interface established for this purpose."

Physical processes leading to deep convection and High Impact Weather (HIW) in the US rely on a specific set of ingredients that are based on weather and climate experienced there.  However, the learning of deep convection and HIW outside of the US will not only improve our understanding of how it operates in other regions, but also improve our understanding of deep convection and HIW in the US.  Advancing our understanding of heavy rainfall and its processes and precursors will enable improved prediction of rainfall extremes on weather and climate timescales. The C-Band radar will aid in addressing these objectives by providing high-quality dual-polarization radar measurements for a 3-month period during the RELAMPAGO intensive observing period and also following the campaign during the RELAMPAGO hydrometeorological observing period during the wet season.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The exposure and vulnerability of the global population to HIW is increasing as a result of population growth, land use/land cover change, urbanization, and climate change. Severe convective storms have significant impacts on the human-managed environment around the globe. Enhancing our understanding processes capable of triggering intense, deep moist convection will help in mitigating its consequences, and is critical for social, environmental, and economic applications.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>This project is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>Work supported under this award specifically addresses the relatively warm, shallow clouds found at the top of the atmospheric boundary layer, with a specific focus on cloud droplet number concentration, or the number of droplets per unit volume in a cloud.  Droplet number concentration is a key parameter for understanding cloud properties and evolution, and in a pristine region like the SO it can be limited by the availability of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), aerosol particles which absorb water vapor from the air to form droplets. The PIs seek to determine if droplet number concentration can be related to CCN concentration in the local boundary layer or the overlying free troposphere, or if droplet concentrations are more strongly influenced by turbulent cloud motions, removal through precipitation, or other meteorological factors. Previous studies suggest that low clouds in the colder air to the south of the South Polar front have higher mean droplet concentrations than the warmer clouds to the north, a difference which is not presently understood. Possible explanations include increased CCN production in the colder ocean waters to the south (meaning closer to the South Pole), and higher precipitation rates with increased CCN removal to the north.<br/><br/>A variety of observations, collected in collaboration with other SOCRATES projects, are used to examine the controls on space and time variability of droplet number concentration in SO clouds:<br/><br/>* size-resolved aerosol and CCN concentrations, both above and within the boundary layer, using probes and inlets on the GV at multiple flight levels;<br/><br/>* precipitation rates, cloud updraft and downdraft strength, and cloud base and top heights determined from onboard radar and lidar.<br/><br/>* near-surface aerosol and CCN concentrations from low-level flight legs, planned to sample as low as 150m above surface;<br/><br/>* profiles of ambient temperature, moisture, and wind from dropsondes released from the aircraft.<br/><br/>These data are combined to produce integrated datasets including a north-south ""SOCRATES curtain"" dataset which facilitates comparison with numerical model output.  Modeling activities based on these datasets are also planned.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research. Outreach to K-12 students and the general public is conducted during the campaign through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website. This project provides support to two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia.  The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) maintain a blog during the period just before, during, and just after the field campaign, helping to communicate the science to a broader audience.  The award also provides funding for the education of a graduate student and to bring three additional graduate students to the campaign, allowing them to gain valuable experience in fieldwork.<br/><br/>The eight week campaign deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  The near-surface wind convergence is a consequence of a strong north-south sea surface temperature (SST) contrast between the ""cold tongue"" along the equator and the warmer waters to the north. Surface winds near the equator tend to blow across SST contrasts and converge over the warmer water, and surface convergence induces rising motions favorable to convection.<br/><br/>But the PIs argue against the notion that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is driven primarily by surface convergence, pointing out that surface convergence does not automatically result in strong convection and heavy rainfall.  Instead they hypothesize that thermodynamic factors including convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), and the influence of moisture through entrainment and downdrafts are key to understanding convection in the region.<br/><br/>The project also considers convection over the southwest Caribbean, where convection occurs despite a lack of SST contrasts and a relatively dry atmosphere.  The PIs suggest that convection in these unfavorable conditions constitutes a self-sustaining equilibrium state which can develop given the right initial state, although the same environmental conditions would equally favor suppressed convection.  Such multiple equilibrium behavior is seen in idealized models and has been associated with self-aggregation in cloud resolving models, and the PIs hypothesize that it is implicated in the active and suppressed phases of easterly waves.<br/><br/>The research is conducted using data collected during the campaign in combination with a variety of numerical models including a cloud resolving version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  The PIs have several strategies for representing the relevant dynamics and thermodynamics in an idealized form, often using a small doubly-periodic domain. Observational comparisons use data from OTREC as well as earlier field campaigns (EPIC and TEPPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CubeSats are recently developed economical tools that because of their size and low cost can carry aloft only a few instruments generally built using off-the-shelf components. Because of this, observations must be designed to narrowly focus on the specific science objectives of the mission. Despite this limitation, NSF's CubeSat program has demonstrated a high scientific output from CubeSats launched since the initiation of this program in 2010.  The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the design of multipoint networks and constellation-type campaigns that use simpler payloads but combined can be targeted to attack some of the more complex problems in the Geospace environment and related fields. The broader impacts of this project are significant.  The project builds directly on previous NSF investment in the FIREBIRD-II mission, and will maximize the benefits (both scientific and in terms of student education and training) from this and future CubeSat missions supported by NSF. The project will likely contribute to a better understanding of 'space weather' by better understanding the radiation belt sources and losses and thus indirectly contribute to more robust space infrastructure.  <br/><br/>A key challenge to be addressed in this project is in integrating disparate types of measurements across platforms to address scientific problems that are beyond the original scope of the individual missions. For the FIREBIRD-II mission, this translates into the development of additional data products such as electron spectra that enable exploring science questions about the spatial scale of precipitation where coordinated measurements can get at the picture but the data needs to be transformed into forms that are comparable to other instruments.  To investigate the spatial scales of precipitation regions, electron observations by FIREBIRD-II can, for example, be combined with ground-based VLF receivers capable of detecting D- and E-region ionization due to precipitating radiation belt electrons or radars that observe the associated ionospheric heating signatures from lower energy electrons.  The lessons learned in this development will be applied to the upcoming AFRL DSX and VPM CubeSats scheduled for launch in the end of 2016 and early 2017, respectively. Combining these CubeSats with FIREBIRD-II and other existing space assets that measure radiation belt electron precipitation, lightning observing networks on the ground, radars, VLF receivers, and a sophisticated model of lightning whistler propagation and dissipation, a campaign will be developed to study for the first time the radiation belt - lightning interactions from the lower atmosphere to the ionosphere to space and observe the resulting precipitation."

Building upon its history of successful stewardship of NCAR since 1960, UCAR will manage and support NCAR, enabling the center to serve and advance the scientific community by providing cutting-edge observational and computational facilities; carrying out challenging interdisciplinary research in the atmospheric and related sciences; executing innovative education, outreach, and training programs; and building a diverse scientific and engineering workforce. The key elements of UCAR's strategy include working closely with the community in planning, implementation and review; identifying future requirements; developing compelling NCAR strategic plans; providing effective and efficient management of resources; creating an environment that attracts and retains exceptional talent; and enabling new partnerships that advance the science. UCAR will continue to adapt and improve its management to ensure that NCAR can respond effectively to new opportunities and challenges in the years ahead. UCAR, as the collective voice of the university community, brings a unique capability to the operation of NCAR, and UCAR's 71 members and many academic, government, and industry partners enable the Center to represent broad national and international interests.<br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: Understanding Earth and its complex, dynamic and interacting components is among the most exciting and meaningful contemporary scientific challenges. NCAR, under UCAR management with many national and international partnerships, seeks to observe, understand, and ultimately predict the atmosphere and related components of the Earth system. This research requires a creative workforce, interdisciplinary teamwork, increasingly capable Earth- and space-based observational techniques, advanced computational facilities and related analysis and data services, and global communication networks. This synthesis will lead to a better understanding of problems that are national and global in both scale and impact. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Human activities are changing the weather, climate, and environment. At the same time, as our population and technological infrastructure increases, we have become more vulnerable to severe weather, climate variability and change, and other changes in Earth's life support systems. Applying the understanding and technology enabled by NCAR and its partners for the benefit of humanity is therefore the practical, useful, and increasingly urgent side of the center's range of activities. Examples include improved weather and climate forecasts and creation of tools to help policy makers and industries to manage natural resources such as air, water, energy, fisheries, and ecosystems. The discoveries that will enable society to respond to the environmental challenges facing it will be made by people with diverse and global perspectives. UCAR is committed to working with NCAR to educate, recruit, and retain talented students and professionals, especially those with nontraditional backgrounds. Because UCAR is based in academia, its management provides a natural coupling of research with education. This goes beyond developing future scientists to training teachers, developing educational materials, providing research opportunities for students, and reaching the public through a variety of avenues. UCAR's policy of free and open exchange of ideas, data, models, observational platforms and instruments, and information helps maximize the impacts of NCAR's research, development, and educational activities."

To isolate essential vs. non-essential processes of moist midlatitude dynamics, a set of geophysical fluid dynamics problems will be formulated and investigated by a research team of applied mathematicians and atmospheric scientists.  The participants will use a minimal modeling approach coupled with comparison to observational data, and when appropriate, to the results of comprehensive-physics numerical computations. The goal is to isolate the essential physical mechanisms and the role of precipitating convection in shaping some of the canonical structures of the midlatitude atmosphere.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>A minimal model will be used to study midlatitude dynamics with precipitating convection.  Cloud microphysics is included in the limit that the time scales associated with condensation, auto-conversion and evaporation are small compared to all other relevant time scales in the problem (advection, buoyancy, rotation, and rainfall). The simplified thermodynamics is based on the following design principle: the conservation laws for momentum, energy, moist entropy, and total water should all be retained, but they should have the simplest nontrivial form possible. Under these assumptions, the fully three-dimensional model accounts for precipitating convection while vastly reducing the number of necessary closure models.  Three main case studies will be conducted: (i) evolution of one or more baroclinically unstable mode(s) to investigate the role of latent heat release in the midlatitude occlusion process, (ii) the dynamics of a single-jet in the presence of low-altitude convection to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the jet-convection feedback loop and its saturation, and (iii) double jet dynamics with convection as a simplified model for the occasional merger of the polar and subtropical jets and the subsequent possibility of extreme precipitation events.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>A primary goal of the project is cross training of junior researchers in atmospheric science and mathematical modeling. New developments in mathematical modeling will be brought to the atmospheric sciences community, and simultaneously junior mathematicians will be exposed to key open problems in atmospheric science. As one way of sharing new insights with both communities, the minimal model will be made publicly available as the UW Virtual Atmosphere, with educational/research modules to explore the effects of precipitating convection on the Eady baroclinic instability problem (UWVA:Eady), and nonlinear evolution of eddies and jets (UWVA:Jet). The research is likely to provide valuable insights into extreme weather associated with jet superposition, anticipated to be more frequent in a globally warming world.  Slight increases in tropical sea-surface temperatures are expected to lead to a general northward displacement of the Northern Hemisphere subtropical jet, and thus to an increased likelihood of subtropical and polar jet superposition.  Better understanding of the role of precipitating convection in the formation and evolution of midlatitude eddies and jets will likely lead to improved ability to predict high-impact weather in a warmer climate."

The corona, the atmosphere of the sun, is where space weather events originate. Solar eruptions (coronal mass ejections and solar flares), which occur in the corona, are complex electromagnetic events and can have significant impact at Earth and throughout the solar system. In the near-Earth environment, they can adversely impact satellite electronics, cause disruptions to power grids, and harm humans in space. The effects of a 1 in 100 year storm are now the focus of the NSTC subcommittee on Space Weather Research, Operations, and Mitigation. Currently, measurements are of the solar corona modest sensitivity and resolution and from a single vantage point, that of Earth. These single point measurements are complicated to interpret due to the highly 3D nature of the system. This project will both serve as a test for a new paradigm of future high resolution space-borne instruments enabling multi-point measurements and generate unprecedented data that will enable entirely new science. This instrument is designed to work as a system with NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope which will take very high resolution images from a smaller field of view in the low corona. <br/><br/>The massively-multiplexed Coronal Spectropolarimetric Magnetometer or mxCSM, is a 15-cm hybrid off-axis mirror coronagraph equipped with a six-channel spectropolarimeter to measure the magnetic polarization signals of six coronal emission lines (CELs) simultaneously over a large field of view (FOV). With its high polarization sensitivity and large FOV, mxCSM will be able to observe the evolution of the linear polarization of the whole field with a high temporal resolution sufficient for the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and other solar eruptions. It will also measure the line-of-sight component of coronal magnetic fields in active regions with lower spatial and temporal resolution. Synoptic data from mxCSM can be used to perform tomographic inversion of the magnetic fields of large, long lived coronal structures. These new coronal polarization data will yield stringent observational constraints for coronal model validations, and will help advance our understanding of the processes that heat and structure the corona."

The close collaborations between the PI and Co-PI will add new research field (atmospheric sciences) and strengthen the current research and teaching (computer sciences) at Morgan State University, an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) that has been recently designated as Maryland's preeminent public urban research university. An education component is built into the study, where a graduate student and an undergraduate student will be supported and trained in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field at Morgan State University.<br/><br/>Coherent updraft cores are the engine for convective heat and moisture transport. However, systematic study of convective updraft cores from a Lagrangian point of view has not been performed before. This project will take advantages of existing computer image recognition and machine learning algorithms, adapt them to high resolution cloud-resolving model simulations, in order to automatically identify updraft core features and track them throughout their full life cycle. Three sets of progressively more sophisticated simulations will be carried out: ensemble simulations of triggered single convection, quasi-equilibrium state simulation, and case studies using observed large-scale forcing. Convective updraft core characteristics such as their sizes, depths, lifespan and spatial distributions will be derived from these simulations. Model sensitivity tests that perturb environmental conditions, e.g., stability, water vapor, wind shear, will reveal environmental controls on updraft core characteristics. <br/><br/>Convection organization will also be studied in the context of updraft cores through their congregation, merging and splitting.  Although not immediately achievable in the framework of current project, the ultimate goal is to use the time-variant convective core concept established in this study to improve cumulus parameterization in global climate predictions. A database including thousands of convective updraft cores and their lifecycles will be compiled and made public through this project for further study.<br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary study that takes advantage of existing data mining and machine learning algorithms in information sciences and applies them to 3D wind fields where convection is embedded. Identifying and tracking updraft cores is a novel approach that will provide new insights to dynamics and physics of moist convection and its organization. The time-dependent updraft core concept can potentially be used to replace the steady state plume model in current GCM cumulus parameterizations, allowing for a scale-independent cumulus parameterization with a physical underlying concept.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early career scientists will be given priority for travel support,<br/><br/>Despite the now extensive knowledge of atmospheric chemistry and the formation of PM, existing models do not reproduce pollutant concentrations in several air basins in the Western US. The chemistry in these regions is significantly impacted by the boundary layer meteorology which can confine the pollution mixture below the height of surrounding terrain for an extended period. During the PCAPs local and regional emissions accumulate and age, changing the composition of the PM. While previous field studies have investigated the boundary and atmospheric chemistry individually, no studies have collected a suite of data needed to assess their interactions. Additionally, because precursors of PM are often emitted with GHGs, both will be impacted by GHG mitigation plans. The goal of this workshop is to bring together research leaders and young scientists in the boundary-layer meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and urban carbon cycle communities to develop joint and complementary science objectives for a large measurement campaign in the western U.S. Discussions will focus on the following topics: 1) the impact of agricultural emissions, residential wood combustion, and volatile chemical products on wintertime air quality; 2) the data and parameterizations needed to improve models of wintertime PCAPs; 3) the impact of inter-basin transport and vertical stratification of PCAPs; 4) the emission ratios between PM precursors and GHGs; and 5) how GHG mitigation actions might affect wintertime air quality. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of a document to guide development of a future field campaign focused on addressing these scientific goals.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work funded under this award contributes to SOCRATES by measuring aerosol and cloud hydrometeor properties, specifically addressing three questions (from the proposal summary):<br/><br/>1) What are the chemical and physical properties of sub-micron and coarse-mode aerosol particles in the region, and how do they relate to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN, particles around which cloud droplets form), INP, and cloud properties?<br/><br/>2) What fraction of SO condensed water remains supercooled as a function of temperature, and can this be related to a dearth of INPs?<br/><br/>3) What is the role of biological aerosol particles in cloud formation over the SO?<br/><br/>These questions are addressed through in-situ air sampling using inlets available on the GV.  Sampling of cloudy air uses a specialized inlet known as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI), which separates cloud droplets and ice crystals from smaller aerosol particles and other non-cloud material. Droplets and ice crystals are heated in the CVI to evaporate their water substance and the resulting vapor is measured with a laser hygrometer to determine total condensed water content.  Once the water is evaporated the droplets and ice are reduced to their nucleating particles (referred to as residual particles), which are counted and sized using an aerosol spectrometer.  A fluorescence-based spectrometer is used to separately count and size biological particles so that their role in nucleation can be assessed.  Residual particles are collected on slides for laboratory analysis using electron and X-ray microscopy that can determine morphology, composition, and mixing state. A key question in the analysis is the hygroscopicity of the particles, meaning their ability to absorb water vapor and thus serve as CCN. Additional measurements from wing-mounted supercooled liquid probes are used to estimate the ratio of SLW to ice content in the clouds.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research.  A further contribution to basic research is the development of a clean-in-place system for the CVI inlet, which will improve the reliability of the CVI for future users, particular in salty marine environments.  Campaign outreach to K-12 students and the general public is conducted through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website. Events in which campaign videos, microscope images of cloud particles, and aerosol samples collected during the campaign are presented to the general public, are also planned.  This award provides support and training to a graduate student and funds the participation of a second student in the campaign, thereby contribution to the development of the future workforce in this research area."

Recent observations, including increased fire activity in 2017, suggest that aridity in the Iberian Peninsula is already increasing. This multi-institutional team of researchers seeks to provide a spatial and temporal context for on-going and future climatic changes in this region by constructing a 2,500-year-long history of hydroclimate variability from precipitation-sensitive stalagmites formed in caves in central and southern Portugal. Rainfall in Iberia is strongly correlated to the strength of the Azores sub-tropical high-pressure system, and these cave sites lie at its climatological epicenter.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this project aims to bridge the hydroclimate knowledge gap for the last 2,500 years using sub-decadally resolved, multi-proxy stalagmite records (carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, trace element abundances, growth laminae, and high precision Uranium/Thorium dating) from cave sites in central and southern Portugal.  Based on measuring, counting and comparing the uppermost Uranium/Thorium age from one stalagmite, these laminae appear to be annual in nature. Resulting data will be combined and evaluated with similarly-resolved hydroclimate-sensitive records from northern Iberia (Spain) and northwest Africa (Morocco), creating a latitudinal transect that will allow spatial and temporal constraints to be placed on the Azores High<br/><br/>This research could also provide a significant spatial bridge between the only existing high-resolution paleo-hydroclimatic reconstructions (northern Morocco and northern Spain) from this zone. Together, these time series will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of dynamical changes in the regional climate system through time, particularly in the spatial extent and intensity of the Azores High.<br/><br/>The state of the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region during recent millennia, and particularly medieval times, remains the subject of considerable debate in both proxy- and model-based studies.  Of particular interest is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an atmospheric dipole between the Iceland low and the Azores high, which is strongly linked to regional inter-annual precipitation variability in Western Europe and northwest Africa through the routing of storms tracks. Dynamics of the NAO and the Azores High are poorly understood prior to the late 19th century, and as a result, the drivers of NAO/Azores High dynamics have not been adequately explored.  An ideal place to address these deficiencies is central and southern Portugal, where few, if any, high-resolution records exist.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) includes the potential to transform the understanding of the nature and drivers of past Iberian hydroclimate variability, and through comparison with model simulations, how it may respond to future anthropogenic forcing. As such, the development and synthesis of these high resolution and precisely dated records will be of value to the broad climate/paleoclimate communities.  All data produced as part of this project will be made publicly available and archived on community websites. The project unites a diverse, internationally recognized team of researchers from major research institutions (Iowa State University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of New Mexico) and liberal arts colleges (Cornell College, Union College) to apply multi-disciplinary approaches to addressing long-term hydroclimate dynamics. This work will involve the training of a PhD student already in residence at Iowa State and at least eight undergraduate researchers in state-of-the-art climate reconstruction and modeling techniques.  A component of data collection in Portugal will involve citizen-based science at a local tourist cave and with regional caving groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For such fluctuations, velocity-space processes are essential for understanding the physics of the solar wind plasma. The project team will use both hybrid and particle-in-cell simulation techniques to pursue theoretical and computational aspects of the research. The proposed observational studies will utilize data from several different spacecraft flying in the near-Earth's space, and these data will be closely related to the diagnostics of the numerical simulations.<br/>"

This has serious consequences for our technological assets both in space and on the ground, including interruption of tele-communication, compromising the safety of astronauts, and damaging satellites and electric power grids.  Therefore, focused investigations of solar eruptions and the associated magnetic field evolution of the solar corona have the potential to reveal the underlying physical mechanism(s) of the drivers of space weather at the Sun.  This 3-year project is aimed at investigating the physical origins of solar eruptions at the Sun by means of data-driven, three-dimensional (3-D) numerical simulations.  The project also has a strong educational component as it provides partial support for a Ph.D. student and a junior scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  Thus, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This 3-year project is aimed at answering some of the fundamental questions concerning the physical origin and evolution of solar eruptions, which will expand the frontier of existing knowledge on the energy release during solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) on the Sun and the associated reconfiguration of the solar corona.  The underlying research objectives are: (i) understanding the fundamental active region (AR) eruptive physics; and, (ii) providing a practical tool as an initiation model for the development of a physics-based data-driven space weather prediction code.  The research plan is to use the MHD-DARE model developed by the project team, together with observational data from the HMI and AIA instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), to address the following science questions: (i) what are the basic characteristics of magnetic field configuration before a solar eruption?; (ii) how do photospheric surface motions, including shear, convergence and flux cancellation bring the initial emerged fields to such an unstable configuration?; (iii) what are the specific roles played by magnetic flux rope and magnetic reconnection in triggering solar eruptions?; (iv) can we understand the complexity of various flare/eruption process from topology and evolution of the magnetic field?; and, (v) how do solar eruptions leave imprints on the photospheric fields?  These aspects of the AR development will be connected to the evolution of the coronal field long before and during a solar eruption, for which the project team will use the MHD-DARE model to carry out numerical simulations driven by the time-dependent vector magnetograms.  Then, the simulation results will be analyzed to yield the evolution of the magnetic topology, electric currents, plasma flows, and Lorentz force to determine the primary triggering mechanisms of the solar eruption, and they will be compared with relevant solar observations.  In addition, the project team plans to further improve the current model by including a realistic energy equation and a plasma configuration directly from the photosphere into the solar corona."

Owing to geophysical constraints (~2/3 of aurora in the southern hemisphere are above the ocean), there is a lack of information on the southern hemisphere aurora. Current knowledge of the aurora is based primarily on observations made in the Northern Hemisphere. This has prevented full understanding of the magnetosphere-ionosphere as a whole system. With the advent of satellite-based particle and optical imaging and more observations made in the southern polar regions, there is mounting evidence suggesting that auroras are not always hemispherically symmetric and/or conjugate, especially under certain conditions and certain types of aurora. Therefore, studying the aurora from both hemispheres can provide much more information about the polar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling than any single hemisphere does. This type of approach is essential because past studies have either relied on global auroral images from a single hemisphere or on combined particle data from both hemispheres. The expected results will be made available through the JHU/APL (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory) Auroral Particles and Images Team web site, which serves up a variety of auroral data and models, including the OVATION Prime, to the space physics community. Furthermore, the expected result can be used to update the OVATION Prime auroral model.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to study hemispheric symmetries and asymmetries of the large-scale north and south auroral intensity to improve current knowledge of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Specifically, the following questions are to be addressed as science objectives: (1) Are there relationships between the IMF (Interplanetary Magnetic Field) and the north-south asymmetry of the aurora? (2) Does the southern aurora respond to sunlight in a similar manner as the northern aurora does? and (3) Is there a relationship between the geomagnetic field and auroral intensity? This project consists of analyzing FUV (far-ultraviolet) auroral images acquired by NASA's TIMED/GUVI from both hemispheres. It will be carried out using (1) a large number (~6 years' worth) of near-global auroral images in the FUV band with unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution not only from the Northern Hemisphere but also from the lesser-known Southern Hemisphere and (2) the quantitative inversion of images made at certain wavelengths which can reveal characteristics of these precipitating particles such as their energy and the power they deposit in the upper atmosphere. This method has been tested in recent case studies involving GUVI data and have demonstrated the accuracy and utility of these inversions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at studying SEP events associated with filament eruptions on the Sun.  The goal is to isolate and investigate SEPs accelerated at CME-driven shocks with minimal flare material contributions.  The work expands on other researchers' recent results by using more instruments to cover a broader energy range and extend the analysis.  The methodology involves spectral and elemental composition data analysis techniques that are well established.  The dissemination of the scientific results will be made broadly to the scientific and space weather prediction communities through published articles, scientific talks, and personal communications.  In addition, project results and relevant data sets will be made available via the public web pages of the ACE and STEREO Science Centers.  The three project teams have excellent track record of publications, participating (often in leadership roles) in various workshops (e.g., SHINE), and attending scientific conferences.  Both the team leader and a Co-PIs are under-represented minorities and funding is included for the involvement of an undergraduate student.  The project will promote strong international collaborations for the benefit of advancing space weather research both in the USA and worldwide.<br/>  <br/>The research plan of this 3-year SHINE project includes four main tasks.  The first task is to examine the characteristics of heavy ions for previously identified events.  The spectral shape variation as a function of particle species reveals characteristics of the accelerating shock, while the composition provides important clues regarding the SEP seed population.  The second task is to study smaller SEP events associated with filament eruptions by using the more sensitive SEP sensors onboard ACE and STEREO.  The inclusion of STEREO data alone has the potential to increase the number of events suitable for study and, in combination with near-Earth spacecraft, allows the examination of SEP characteristics as a function of longitude.  The third task is to define stronger constrains on the primary acceleration region by combining calculations of the particle-release times, for both for single-and multiple-spacecraft events, with timing of the corresponding solar signatures.  The fourth task is to study in detail similar filament eruption events without associated SEP events in order to identify specific features that are key to SEP generation.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the acceleration and transport of SEPs during solar eruptive events.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.

Because the intensity of cosmic rays hitting Earth is not uniform, it is important to place neutron monitors at multiple locations to form a complete picture of cosmic rays in space.  Neutron monitors are capable of detecting Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) as well as background neutrons produced by the ever-present Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR).  They produce decades-long records of stable and reliable cosmic ray intensity measurements.  Furthermore, observations from wide-spread networks of monitors can be analyzed to provide high-time resolution measurements of the most energetic and powerful of solar particle events, Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs).  The University of Delaware (UD) neutron monitors have suffered from lack of external funding over the past few years, and they are currently minimally supported through institutional funds (from the UD and the Bartol Research Institute).  However, this funding will end in July of 2019, and plans are in place to dismantle the stations beginning of June, 2019, unless external funding can be secured.  The purpose of this one-year RAPID project is to restore the North American network to a functional condition and support operation for one year until longer term support can be secured.<br/><br/>The historic neutron monitor data have shown that at each station the count rate varies with the solar activity cycle.  This is the phenomenon of solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays.  To investigate the origin of the phenomenon, one cannot rely on the count rates of one neutron monitor: hence, one needs to derive the cosmic ray intensity as a function of particle energy or particle rigidity.  Since each neutron monitor is sensitive to primary cosmic rays above some geomagnetic cutoff rigidity, one can combine measurements of stations at different latitudes.  The reliability, stability and robustness of multi-decade measurements is critical for understanding the variability of the Sun.   Of particular interest is the fact that the GCR intensity during the last two solar minimum is the greatest over the period covered by the observations by a significant factor.  This would not have been known without neutron monitors.  The current network of North American neutron monitors, combined with Russian operated stations are strategically located to provide precise, real-time, 3-dimensional measurements of the cosmic-ray angular distribution. Because of the combined effects of Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, high latitude sites have superior directional sensitivity relative to low latitude sites.  At the high latitude sites, where the UD's neutron monitors are located, the SEPs are in-focus, while cosmic rays arriving at low and mid latitude stations arrive from widely dispersed directions.  The complete network of high latitude neutron monitors allows a complete picture of when, where, and from what direction SEPs strike Earth.<br/><br/>In addition to space weather forecasting, data from neutron monitors, such as those to be collected during this one-year RAPID project, are also used in support of other science investigations, beyond studies of cosmic rays and heliospheric physics.  One use of neutron monitor data is to monitor the flux of neutrons produced by cosmic rays for a broad range of practical applications, including detecting nuclear threats for homeland and national security, calculating the radiation dose to airplane crews and passengers, understanding the rate of single-event upsets (soft errors) in microelectronic devices, measuring soil and snow moisture content, and calculating the production rate of cosmogenic radionuclides used for atmospheric tracers and nuclear treaty verification.  For all these applications, neutrons and other secondary particles produced in the atmosphere and surface materials by galactic cosmic rays (and occasionally by solar particles) are either the source of the effect or an important background.<br/><br/>This one-year RAPID project will provide an educational experience for an undergraduate student to help maintain and calibrate the neutron monitor station in Newark, Delaware.  The research agenda of this RAPID project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"".  <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"".  <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability.

Turbulence in a magnetized plasma is the primary mechanism responsible for transforming energy at large injection scales into small-scale motions, which are ultimately dissipated as heat in systems such as the solar corona and wind.  In this regard,  the main purpose of this 3-year SHINE project is to improve present understanding of plasma heating and distribution function dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas using both hybrid and fully kinetic, continuum Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. <br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project aims to accomplish the following three science objectives.  The first objective is to develop a better understanding of the distribution function dynamics related to wave damping in fully non-linear turbulence.  The second objective is to examine the behavior of Alfvenic turbulence near the proton scale.  The third objective is to determine the relative importance of proton and electron heating in large-scale intermittent structures produced as a natural consequence of turbulence.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the nature of turbulence in space and astrophysical plasmas.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.  <br/><br/>The research outcome of this project may have implications for weakly collisional fusion experiments, and it could provide additional insight into a myriad of heliospheric domains, and be of interest to the astrophysics community.  The parameters chosen and the continuum nature of the simulations will provide valuable particle distribution function information for existing and upcoming spacecraft missions, such as Solar Probe Plus.  The knowledge gained from this project will aid in the development of improved models of energy transport, which may aid in global modeling of many disparate, large-scale phenomena.  The full simulation data from the final stage of the project will be made available to the community to analyze and compare directly to available spacecraft data.  Additionally, the simulation code, Gkeyll, and associated analysis scripts are openly available for community use.  The project will support a graduate student at the University of Maryland College Park.  Additionally, underrepresented undergraduate students from mid-Atlantic minority-serving institutions will be involved in the research through the Graduate Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics (GRAD-MAP) program during their annual winter workshops.  The students in the workshops will develop input scripts and analyze simulation data to introduce them to high performance computing research, aiding in their preparation for graduate school. The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research."

Koopman operators were derived in the early 1930s and used to prove an important theorem on the behavior of idealized dynamical systems.  But they remained largely unknown beyond dynamical systems theory until the early 2000s, when their usefulness for complicated, data intensive problems was recognized.  Since that time they have been applied in such data-driven applications as fluid flow, stability analysis in power networks, the development of financial trading algorithms, and brain activity research. Like these applications, climate research is often data-driven and involves analysis of a complex system, thus Koopman operators could be a valuable addition to the climate research toolkit.<br/><br/>Research conducted here applies the Koopman operator framework to three problems in climate dynamics: 1) Understanding the variability and structure of El Nino in paleoclimate and current climate; 2) decadal-scale variability in the climate system and its implications for predictability; and 3) dynamics of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) across multiple timescales.  Research in these areas typically relies on methods such as principle component analysis to characterize variability in terms of spatial patterns and their time evolution.  But these methods yield statistical characterizations that are not dynamically based and may not be optimal for relating the variability patterns to underlying dynamical processes. Koopman operators directly express the dynamics of the system, thus they may prove more insightful for understanding how the dynamics of the climate system give rise to the forms of variability that we observe.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through its potential to enhance understanding of the climate system and thus improve the guidance available to stakeholders and decision makers concerned with climate impacts. In addition, the Principal Investigator (PI) works with the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program, through which he hosts undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.  The project also provides support and training for a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will support the work of a young scientist just starting his career.<br/><br/>Radiation belt particles can be heated, scattered and lost in their interaction with EMIC waves. The investigators will study the propagation characteristics of the waves as a function of geomagnetic activity and radiation belt dynamics. Since ground observations of the waves are much easier and cheaper than satellite observations being able to study them from the ground would be very useful. They will use GOES and THEMIS magnetic field data from space along with conjugate data from the ground in Antarctica  to address three questions: 1.) What is the relative occurrence of EMIC waves both in space and on the ground during each phase of a magnetic storm? 2.) Why are some of the waves not observed on the ground during certain phases (main and recovery) of the storm even though they are observed in space? 3.) How do heavy ions, He+ and O+, contribute to radiation belt precipitation losses and EMIC propagation to the ionosphere? This statistical study will be augmented by plasma data from LANL and THEMIS spacecraft.  Finally they will join with unfunded collaborators at PPPL who will carry out wave simulation studies using a two-dimensional finite element code. This part of the study will investigate attenuation of the waves by heavy ions."

High-latitude ionospheric plasma density and structure play a critical role in the coupled terrestrial ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) system. Experimental and modeling studies have convincingly demonstrated the presence of heavy ions of ionospheric origin in various magnetospheric regions, and that these heavy ions appreciably affect response of the ITM system to solar wind forcing. The ionospheric source and its dynamics play a substantial role in modulating this ion outflow process. This research will directly address several gaps in the current ability to observe the composition of the high-latitude ionospheric plasma and our understanding of the temporally dynamic nature of heating events and associated transients governing composition, ionospheric upflows, and the generation of mesoscale and small-scale ionospheric plasma density structures. Specific science objectives will be to provide detailed data-model analyses to determine the: (1) Location and intensity of storm-time ionospheric sources for molecular ion outflow (2) Contributions of molecular ion recombination, current closure depletion, and ion upflows to plasma loss in realistic auroral current systems (3) Time scales on which major ionospheric loss and transport processes operate, including the effects of electromagnetic induction in highly dynamic situations (4) Effects of three-dimensional current system geometries on ionospheric transport and loss, and the role of these processes in the development of smaller-scale irregularities (5) Temporal dependence of low altitude upflow, including transients in upflow initiation and finite propagation times to higher altitudes, and possible influence of some types of wave-particle interactions on upflow.

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the project builds international scientific collaboration through partnerships with researchers in Costa Rica and Mexico. The project also supports fieldwork participation by three graduate students, and outreach to local students is conducted through short courses at the University of Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>The specific focus of this project is easterly waves, which play a dominant role in the variability of tropical convection and serve as precursors for hurricane formation.  Easterly waves in the southwestern Caribbean are generally thought to propagate into the region from West Africa.  But it is not clear whether easterly waves in the eastern Pacific originate locally or reintensify after crossing Central America from the Caribbean.  Some studies suggest that formation or reintensification occurs through instabilities of strong low-level jets which occur where winds are funneled through gaps in the Central American mountains.  Generation and intensification could also happen through interaction with convection, either over Central America or off the Pacific coast of Colombia, regions where a strong diurnal cycle produces episodes of intense convection and rainfall.<br/><br/>The role of jet stream instabilities in generating or reinvigorating easterly waves is examined using data from meteorological analyses produced using observations from the OTREC campaign (provided by collaborators at ECMWF).  The interaction of easterly waves with convection over Central America is examined using satellite data and surface meteorology stations in Costa Rica. These include GPS receivers already deployed as part of the COCONet network (see EAR-1042906), which record the total precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere.  These assets are augmented with an additional 10 GPS ground stations and 10 surface weather stations, as well as two weather balloon launching stations. A key issue to be examined with the surface stations is the timing of the maxima in precipitable water vapor and precipitation, as the lag between the two (i.e. whether precipitation peaks first or precipitable water peaks first) provides valuable information regarding the organization and vertical structure of convection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, a quantitative assessment of the processes and predictability of these interactions is lacking.  This collaborative research project between the University of Miami and the University at Albany seeks to provide such a quantitative assessment and to seek a more definite answer to an outstanding question in the tropical storm research: ""why do some African easterly waves develop into Tropical Cyclone (TC) and others do not?"".

The first phase will use three decades of observational and reanalysis data to test hypotheses on the physical mechanisms related to the attribution of genesis or lack of genesis to convectively coupled Kelvin Waves, on time scales of 1-3 days.  The second phase will use two decades of archived ensemble forecast data to investigate and quantify the predictability in the context of these physical mechanisms.  The third phase will extend these ideas out to 1-2 weeks, accounting for the roles of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Nio and the Southern Oscillation.  One novel aspect of the project is the awareness of the need to take account of convectively coupled Kelvin Wave amplitude and favorability of African Easterly Wave structures for genesis.  A second novel development is to use ensemble forecasts to push the boundaries of predictability, in identifying the extent to which the complex interactions are predictable out to 1-2 weeks, and connecting the predictability ideas to the governing physical mechanisms and large-scale flow regimes.<br/><br/>The research will provide quantitative information to support tropical forecasters.  The research will also bridge the gap between the weather and subseasonal prediction communities by advancing our understanding of science and predictability beyond traditional weather time scales, which is recognized nationally and globally as a priority.  This will lead to the identification of regimes where predictive skill of genesis and tropical cyclone activity is high or low, thereby providing information to forecasters and ultimately the decision makers who take actions based on a potential tropical cyclone threat.  A by-product of the research will be the feedback provided to operational modeling centers on strengths and weaknesses of their ensemble forecasts.  Diagnostic tools developed in this research will be shared with the research community.  The project will also advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education by funding two students to pursue doctoral research, and in advancing new undergraduate and graduate courses on tropical meteorology.  An annual exchange between Miami and Albany will enable the students to visit meteorological centers and facilities in their reciprocal cities.

While the ability to forecast the track of tropical cyclones has improved, gaps remain in the knowledge and understanding of their formation or genesis, which is reflected in poorer forecasts.

Lightning produces whistler waves, which travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines. Understanding these waves and how they are amplified is important to national security and commercial interests. Military and commercial communications utilize the same very low frequency radio wavelengths and are therefore disrupted by whistler waves. The resulting scientific results will lead to improvement of predictive space weather models. This fits directly into the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, released in 2015. The project supports a female faculty member and will train and educate graduate and undergraduate students in both research and outreach activities. The proposed outreach program will target K-12 students through development of interactive in-class presentations, hands-on activities, and tours of the BU observatory and planetarium. The outreach will engage undergraduate and graduate students in both research and communicating space science to the public.<br/><br/>Whistler mode waves in plasmaspheric plumes exhibit unexpectedly large amplitudes that suggest that waves in this region are very effective in driving energetic electron precipitation. Currently, radiation belt models do not incorporate this effect. In order to understand the role whistler waves in plasmaspheric plumes play on radiation belt dynamics, this award will combine theory, modeling, and data analysis. Quasilinear diffusion theory will be used to evaluate electron scattering due to wave-particle interactions. This will be combined with modeling from a Full Diffusion code to calculate electron diffusion coefficients and a 3D diffusion code to simulate radiation belt electron dynamics. Analysis of observations from multiple spacecraft, including the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, POES/MetOp, and GPS, will establish density, wave, and particle properties associated with the generation of whistler waves in plasmaspheric plumes. The data will be compared to the developed model to answer the science questions.

Recent cave speleothem records from China going back a quarter of a million years convincingly show that the climate over East Asia underwent large and abrupt swings during this time period.  These oscillations occur at multiple timescales, from a few hundred to tens of thousands of years, and they are tied to distinct and varied forcings on the global climate system during Earth's climate history.  The standard interpretation of the speleothem records is that the East Asian summer monsoon intensified or diminished during these oscillations. However, this description is qualitative, and does not factor in the complex behavior of today's East Asian climate which exhibiting both abrupt temporal and spatial shifts as it progresses through the season, in particular from Spring to Meiyu rains, and from Meiyu to Summer rains.<br/><br/>This research explores the hypothesis that changes to the north-south position jet stream impinging on the Tibetan Plateau are the underlying cause of the abrupt climate changes in the past.  Emerging dynamical studies of the modern East Asian climate suggest that it is the latitudinal position of the jet relative to the Plateau that determines the rainfall seasonality -- when the jet is South of the Plateau, it is in a Spring rainfall regime; when it goes just North, then Meiyu; and when the jet goes well North of the Plateau, Summer. The hypothesis provides specific predictions that can be tested for different past climate scenarios, in particular during the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events recorded in ice core records over Greenland; and changes to insolation from changes to the Earth's orbital configuration. <br/><br/>The jet transition hypothesis will be tested using three complementary approaches: <br/>i) Examination of the association between jet streams and East Asian rainfall changes in state-of-the art simulations of two particular past climate scenarios (mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum) by various modeling groups around the world;<br/>ii) Idealized climate model simulations using a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model necessary for resolving the fine-scale features of East Asian climate;<br/>iii) Investigating the modern climate data and high-resolution simulations of 20th century climate to see if similar jet-rainfall relationships hold for climate changes over this historical period.<br/><br/>This project involves international collaborations with scientists from Taiwan and China, and supports a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Public lectures on paleoclimate changes (with focus on East Asia) will be offered at the Lawrence Hall of Science, using the ""Science on a Sphere"" (SOS) setup for climate data visualization."

Such grids suffice to capture the dynamics of cyclones, fronts, and other large-scale atmospheric phenomena, but these phenomena depend critically on processes with spatial scales much smaller than the grid spacing.  The small-scale processes must be represented indirectly, through parameterization schemes which estimate their net impact on the resolved atmospheric state.  For example clouds are typically too small for the grid spacing yet they are critical for moving moisture from the ocean surface to the mid-troposphere, thus cloud parameterizations play a key role in determining atmospheric humidity even on the largest spatial scales.  Parameterization schemes are inherently approximate, and the development of schemes which produce realistic simulations is a central challenge of model development.  Shortcomings in parameterization limit the usefulness of weather and climate models both for scientific research and for societal applications.<br/><br/>Most parameterization schemes depend critically on various parameters whose values cannot be determined a priori but must instead be found through trial and error.  This task, referred to as ""tuning"", is laborious as it is performed separately for each parameterization scheme and involves multiple integrations of the model in multiple configurations. It is also inefficient in its use of observations, which is unfortunate given the large amount of observational data available from satellites and other sources. The resulting parameter sets may not be optimal and may produce unexpected results when all the schemes interact with each other in global simulations.  Finally, manual tuning is not conducive to uncertainty quantification, which would be valuable for estimating the uncertainty in future climate change projections. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to replace ad hoc manual tuning with a combination of data assimilation, machine learning, and fine-scale process modeling using large eddy simulation (LES) models.  LES models have grid spacings of a few tens of meters and can explicitly simulate the clouds and turbulence represented by parameterization schemes.  These ingredients are combined to create a global Machine Learning Atmospheric Model (MLAM), in which LES models embedded in selected grid columns of a global model explicitly simulate subgrid-scale processes which are represented by parameterization schemes in the other columns. Machine learning is used to tune the schemes to emulate the behavior of the LES simulations, so that explicit simulations become an online benchmark for parameterization.  In this way all the schemes can be tuned together and interactively within a running global simulation.  Observational data from a variety of sources is assimilated during the model integration to provide a further constraint on parameter values, and estimates of parameter uncertainty are generated as part of the automated tuning.  A similar tuning process is implemented in an ocean general circulation model, and the two are combined to produce a machine learning climate model.  Model tuning is generally viewed as a necessary but mundane activity which is not in itself a research topic.  But a model capable of learning its parameters from observations and process models offers a new path forward, toward both better models and better ways of using models.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the societal value of better forecasts and projections from weather and climate models.  The work directly addresses uncertainty in forecasts and projections used by decision makers to plan for weather and climate impacts.  In addition, the modeling strategy developed here is applicable to a broad class of research areas which face the problem of relating large-scale behaviors to small-scale unresolved processes (the problem of relating genotypes to phenotypes in evolutionary biology, for example).  In addition, the PIs will establish a cross-disciplinary graduate program on data-driven Earth system modeling.

It is a collaborative effort between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and University of Michigan.  The objective is to develop a new generation of numerical simulation codes and tools for community-wide investigation of Solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), and solar energetic particles (SEP) to test theories of solar eruptions against observed events and work towards a predictive capability.  The Modular Solar Eruptions Capability (MSEC) to be developed will consist of a set of interchangeable modules and libraries, including an observables and a training library, which will enable the user to model a complete solar eruption event, from energy build-up by flux emergence to space weather impact at Earth.  The new capability builds on recent advances by the proposing team in understanding the physics of flares and CMEs and in modeling space weather.  The team has developed some of the leading theories for solar activity and has delivered some of the most widely used space weather models that is currently available to the community.    Specific defining objectives for the development of the MSEC include: utilizing a two-temperature model for the solar plasma and incorporating the necessary physics important for the energy state of the solar atmosphere; utilizing a new phenomenological model for the solar wind-based Alfvn-wave acceleration and dissipation; exploring the physical connection between the upper convection zone and the solar corona by coupling two state-of-the-art models of flux emergence with the global model of the solar corona, thereby addressing the issue of energy build-up and CME initiation in a self-consistent manner.  The team forms a strong collaboration between internationally recognized experts in basic solar and heliospheric theory, in the modeling and data analysis of observed events, and in computational physics. <br/><br/>When completed, the MSEC will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) for access by the scientific community and eventual transition to use for operational space weather forecasting.  The state-of-the-art simulation codes and tools comprising the final MSEC constitute an innovative and potentially transformative capability that will be used by the whole community to attack the solar eruption problem. While the team will pursue an exciting science program that uses the new models to attack the core science problems in solar eruptions, it is envisioned that the bulk of the science results ultimately will be obtained by the outside community.  The results of this effort will help advance our understanding and modeling of solar eruptions, which are high priority national space weather needs.  Educational components of the project include the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  The collaboration builds on and greatly strengthens a longstanding partnership between the partners.  Amongst others, this will provide the opportunity for students of University of Michigan to work with leading NASA scientists and have access to the unique resources at GSFC, a national facility."

Initial research led by the PI focused in the Cordillera Vilcanota of Peru has identified that most precipitation occurs at night, is likely stratiform rather than convective in structure, and is associated with Amazonian moisture transport arriving from the northwest. These findings upend conventional understanding on regional precipitation in the scientific literature; however, it is unclear whether these patterns also hold for other regions in the tropical Andes. For this CAREER proposal, project activities aim to address the following research questions:<br/>1) How do the temporal patterns, moisture source regions, and ENSO relationships with precipitation occurrence vary in the tropical Andes? 2) What is the vertical structure (e.g., echo top heights, moist layer depths, melting layer heights) of tropical Andean precipitation and how does it evolve temporally? The tropical Andes Mountains will serve as the study site, with in-situ observations focusing on the glacierized regions above 4,000 m in the Cordillera Vilcanota (Peru) and Cordillera Real (Bolivia) and adjacent populated valleys. <br/>The educational activities of the proposed project will be based in both the tropical Andes and the southern Appalachian Mountains and include the following: 1) Involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of the proposed research, including extensive field experiences, 2) Development of collaborative partnerships with the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio de Abad de Cusco<br/>(Peru) and the Universidad Mayor de San Andres (Bolivia), 3) Education and outreach programs with exposure to 250,000 annual visitors at Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina, and 4) K-12 education activities in a rural mountain school district in conjunction with the 2012 North Carolina Teacher of the Year.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>Precipitation variability in tropical high mountains is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, factor influencing local climatic expression and a variety of environmental processes, including glacier behavior and water resources. Precipitation phase (e.g., rain vs. snow), timing (e.g., afternoon vs. overnight), frequency, and amount influence surface albedo and soil moisture, whereas cloud cover associated with precipitation events reduces solar irradiance. Considerable uncertainty remains in the multiscale atmospheric processes influencing precipitation patterns and their associated regional variability in the tropical Andes -- particularly related to<br/>precipitation phase, timing, and vertical structure. The proposed research is transformative in that it aims to investigate the multiple spatiotemporal atmospheric processes associated with precipitation delivery in the tropical Andes, which is of considerable importance to climate variability and change, glacier behavior, hydrology, agriculture, ecosystems, and paleoclimatic reconstructions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>The proposed research, education, and outreach activities will build on the mission of Appalachian State University, which is to resourcefully blend teaching and scholarship. In particular, the proposed activities will promote collaborative interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach with a variety of partner organizations, both abroad and in the U.S., thereby<br/>fostering global learning. The proposed project will engage underrepresented groups from the tropical Andes Mountains and rural southern Appalachian Mountains in citizen science and educational activities through local schools and partner organizations. The PI will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of the proposed project, providing them with valuable<br/>international research, outreach, and field experience, thereby furthering their professional development. The proposed instrumentation and citizen science observations will also significantly expand the observational networks in a severely data-limited mountain region, providing an important long-term contribution to the atmospheric science community. Broader scientific<br/>benefits from the proposed activities include improved precipitation forecasts, increased scientific understanding of precipitation-climate-glacier interactions in the context of ongoing climate variability and change, and improved ice core-based reconstructions of past climates in tropical mountain environments."

The Portfolio Review recommended the creation of a class system for facilities. Class 1 contains the large, single location ionospheric radars that the program was initially developed to support. Class 2 contains networks of instruments distributed across broad geographical locations. In response, the AGS Division funded a two-day workshop led by Mark Engebretson and Eftyhia Zesta on May 5-6, 2016 in Greenbelt, Maryland. Workshop participants accepted the Portfolio Review's recommendation that within 3-5 years these arrays should transition from being projects that are separately funded and managed within the science programs to being collectively supported as a Geospace Sciences Facility. Workshop participants discussed possible pathways for optimal, robust, and effective organization and scientific use of these ground arrays. The outcome was a set of recommendations for the ground magnetometer community to carry out which was published in ""Ground Magnetometer Array Planning: Report of a Workshop"" (Engebretson and Zesta, 2017). This award supports the initial implementation of these recommendations, namely to gather detailed information about operations and products of all magnetometer arrays supported by NSF-AGS, and to use this information to create a set of standards that can be used to prepare for transitioning these arrays to a Class 2 Facility.<br/><br/>Ground-based magnetometers are one of the oldest and most effective types of observational tools used to study Earth's space environment. They continue to provide essential data for a variety of studies of Earth's ionosphere, upper atmosphere, and magnetosphere. Magnetometer arrays are supported and maintained by countries all over the world. The US arrays contribute valuable information for synthesizing an understanding of the global dynamics in Earth-space. They remotely measure currents that define the dynamics of the ionosphere and magnetosphere, including those associated with geomagnetic storms and substorms and those associated with global compressions of the magnetosphere from interplanetary shocks and bow shock-related instabilities. They also make it possible to track Alfven wave - borne energy propagation throughout the magnetosphere and wave-particle interactions that variously can intensify or deplete the fluxes of energetic particles, including ultrarelativistic electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts.

The results from the research project will be widely disseminated in conferences and peer reviewed publications.<br/><br/>Clouds and the associated precipitations are products of storms of various sizes ranging from a few kilometers to few thousand kilometers.  In extratropics, particularly in winter seasons, clouds and precipitations are produced mainly by cyclones or storms that are few thousand kilometers wide. These large-scale storms are organized by mid-latitude westerly jet stream meandering meridionally along the latitude circle and tend to amplify over the North Pacific and North Atlantic off the east coasts of the two major continents. Latent heating release occurring during the formation of clouds and precipitations is known to play a critical role in the rapid amplification and lengthening of the life cycle of these storms. Besides releasing latent heat, clouds also alter atmospheric radiative heating profile by absorbing thermal energy emission from the surface and atmosphere below that are warmer while radiating heat out at a colder temperature, as well as reflecting more incoming solar energy back to space that causes cooling at the surface. Cloud-induced radiative heating anomalies may have long-lasting effect not only on the development of these storms but also on the westerly jet stream that carries them, as cyclones tend to preferentially amplify or redevelop over certain longitude sections in mid-latitudes, such as the North Pacific and North Atlantic. This research will diagnose how radiative heating anomalies associated with clouds affects the westerly jet and Rossby waves in which cyclones that produce clouds are embedded.  Specifically, the research team will calculate 3D cloud-induced radiative heating rate anomalies in mid-latitudes using observational datasets and modeling output. They will examine the contribution from such anomalies to the low-frequency variability of the westerly jet stream and large-amplitude long-lasting atmospheric circulation anomalies, such as blocking flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The TTL extends from about 14 to 18.5km over the tropics and is above the tops of all but the tallest convective clouds.  It often contains thin cirrus clouds which, though difficult to see, play an outsized role in trapping outgoing radiation and thus warming the troposphere.  It is sometimes called the ""gateway to the stratosphere"" because most of the water vapor in the stratosphere, and many other stratospheric constituents, enter the stratosphere by moving upward through the TTL.  The stratosphere is extremely dry compared to the troposphere, but stratospheric water vapor is of interest because it has an important greenhouse effect and can lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which play a role in ozone hole formation.<br/><br/>Work under this project seeks to improve understanding of the TTL by developing and deploying a temperature profiler as part of a long-duration ballooning campaign.  The profiler, with the acronym FLOATS (Fiber-optic Laser Operated Atmospheric Temperature Sensor), measures temperature along a fiber optic cable 2km long which is suspended below a balloon gondola.  FLOATS works by injecting laser light into a fiber optic cable and sensing Raman backscattered light. It can measure temperature with 0.3K precision and a vertical resolution of 3m, generating a profile every two to five minutes.  A proof-of-concept prototype was developed under an EAGER award, AGS-1419932.  <br/><br/>FLOATS is deployed as part of the Strateole-2 field campaign organized by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, and the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamic (LMD) of the University of Paris-Saclay.  Strateole-2 is a five-year campaign, with a small validation deployment in 2018 and full science deployments in 2020-2021 and 2022-2023.  Balloons are launched  from the Seychelles (about 5S in the Indian Ocean), with the expectation that each balloon will circle the earth for up to 90 days and observe the TTL between 20S and 15N. This award supports US participation in the validation campaign and the first full science deployment, along with post-campaign analysis.  It is one of three awards made to US PIs for participation in Strateole-2, the full set being AGS-1643022, AGS-1642277/1642246, and AGS-1642650/1653644.<br/><br/>The FLOATS measurements are used to address three scientific objectives, all of which use temperature variations along the fiber optic cable to examine the behavior of gravity waves (wave motions in the air in which buoyancy provides the restoring force).  The first is the depression of the cold point tropopause (CPT) temperature by vertically propagating gravity waves, which is a key factor in determining how much water vapor enters the stratosphere through the TTL.  If condensation or sublimation occurs when relative humidity reaches 100%, then the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere should not exceed the amount corresponding to 100% relative humidity at the CPT temperature. Earlier work by one of the PIs and others suggests that wave-induced CPT temperature depression could be significant, and an increase in wave activity could be responsible for a substantial portion of the decrease in CPT temperature and stratospheric water vapor believed to have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century.   The second science objective is to understand the role of gravity waves in producing cirrus clouds in the TTL.  The problem is complementary to stratospheric dehydration produced by temperature depression, as water vapor prevented from entering the stratosphere by colder temperatures instead freezes out to form cirrus ice particles.<br/><br/>The third objective is to measure the vertical momentum flux associated with the waves.  These waves are critical for the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which can influence the skill of long-range weather forecasts.  Momentum flux would be estimated by combining FLOATS measurements (which give wave amplitude, vertical wavelength, and phase speed) with additional measurement taken on the balloon gondola including wave-induced directional displacement inferred from GPS positioning.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the value of the observations for addressing a variety of questions regarding TTL processes and the stratospheric QBO.  In particular, wave momentum flux data is of value for developing gravity wave parameterizations for use in improving numerical models used for weather forecasting.  FLOATS observations will be made available to the research community from servers at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder, so that they can be freely examined by the research community.  In addition, the project constitutes a demonstration of a novel technology for meteorological observations which could have a wide array of scientific applications. Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area."

They have the potential to do significant damage to satellites, power grids, and humans in space.  CMEs change in significant ways as they propagate through the interplanetary medium.  There are only a few locations between the Sun and the Earth where measurements of the ICMEs (Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections) have been made.  As such, this 3-year SHINE project is potentially transformative as it plans to use data and models to examine ICMEs that hit Mercury and Earth.  The goals are to determine how their properties evolve, how solar wind interactions change them, and what critical factors affect the direction of the magnetic field in them.  This last point is particularly important as the direction of the field when it hits Earth plays a very large role in the effect that the CME has on electric and telecommunications systems.  The outcomes of this study have the potential to vastly improve the science behind prediction models used in space hazard early warning systems. <br/><br/>The main goal of this SHINE project is to develop the physical understanding of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) propagation and evolution in the inner heliosphere inside 1 AU.  To accomplish this goal, the project will use multi-spacecraft observations of the same ICME events at Mercury (MESSENGER) and at 1 AU (ACE, WIND, STEREO), in conjunction with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of these events to focus on ICME magnetic field (strength and direction), speed, and shock structure evolution from 0.3 AU to 1 AU.  The main efforts of the analyses include force-free field fitting of the magnetic ejecta to determine the flux rope orientation and axial magnetic field strength at Mercury and at 1 AU, ICME shock shape determination at both distances, solar wind velocity estimation at Mercury (from proxies as well as models), and MHD simulations of real ICME events in order to discern global structure and changes during propagation.  MESSENGER has now amassed a large dataset of ICMEs from years of observations at Mercury's heliocentric distances, and so this project is very timely and will lay the groundwork in mapping ICME evolution in preparation for the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions.  The three key scientific questions addressed in this project are: (1) how do ICME properties (e.g., magnetic field, speed, shock structure) evolve from Mercury to 1 AU; (2) does the global magnetic field structure inside ejecta change significantly on average from Mercury to 1 AU; and, (3) what are the critical factors that affect change in flux rope orientation during propagation?<br/><br/><br/>The project is highly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, and it will have a strong impact on the SHINE community.  SHINE and the broader scientific community will be served through the following avenues.  First, databases and results from the project will be made freely available to the scientific community.  Second, the project team will engage the SHINE community through the SHINE workshop to take part in a challenge to use the observed ICME events as campaign events to test models.  Third, the project will support an early career, female scientist, thereby contributing towards retaining highly qualified young scientists in academic research and promoting the advancement of women in science.  Fourth, the Co-Is will teach undergraduate and graduate classes related to space science, and the research results will be incorporated, when possible, into advanced undergraduate and graduate classes.  The project team will utilize the scientific outcome of this project to motivate and educate students, teachers, and the public with an appreciation of the importance of solar physics and STEM fields in general by leveraging the special initiatives of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS) at UNH.  Therefore, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research."

This project uses carbonyl sulfide (COS), an atmospheric trace gas, as a proxy for carbon dioxide uptake by plants, since both gases are consumed inside leaf cells by the same enzyme.  This method will be used to estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) through photosynthesis in a tropical rain forest. The results will provide a better understanding of the carbon cycle and its role in the Earth system science. Both the Atmospheric Chemistry Program and the Ecosystem Science Program at NSF are supporting this interdisciplinary project. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.<br/><br/>Three methods being employed for estimating ecosystem GPP in the rainforest are: (1) a field campaign to measure ecosystem fluxes of COS as novel tracer of GPP, (2) a network of distributed flux chambers to obtain new information on spatial and temporal patterns of plant and soil CO2 fluxes, and (3) an education-outreach program that will collect long-term data on CO2 fluxes across the forest canopy.  The field study will take place at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, a site that has hosted over 12 years of ongoing rainforest research. The results of this research will help to answer questions such as how CO2 uptake responds to variations in soil moisture, light and temperature. The study will provide new information on the relationship of ecosystem respiration to changes in temperature during the day and night and help to explain how changes in GPP and ecosystem respiration contribute to large interannual fluctuations in both net ecosystem exchange and forest growth.<br/><br/>This research is well integrated with several educational activities, such as the development of a sensor lab course to provide advanced undergraduate students with hands-on field experiences.  There are also plans for an outreach program for K-12 students at the Stunt Ranch Reserve (a biological field station) in the Santa Monica Mountains and the creation of a Legacy dataset at the field site involving high school students and college level students from both the U.S. and Costa Rica."

The TTL extends from about 14 to 18.5km over the tropics and is above the tops of all but the tallest convective clouds.  It often contains thin cirrus clouds which, though difficult to see, play an outsized role in trapping outgoing radiation and thus warming the troposphere.  It is sometimes called the ""gateway to the stratosphere"" because most of the water vapor in the stratosphere, and many other stratospheric constituents, enter the stratosphere by moving upward through the TTL.  The stratosphere is extremely dry compared to the troposphere, but stratospheric water vapor is of interest because it has an important greenhouse effect and can lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which play a role in ozone hole formation.<br/><br/>Work under this project seeks to improve understanding of the TTL by developing and deploying a temperature profiler as part of a long-duration ballooning campaign.  The profiler, with the acronym FLOATS (Fiber-optic Laser Operated Atmospheric Temperature Sensor), measures temperature along a fiber optic cable 2km long which is suspended below a balloon gondola.  FLOATS works by injecting laser light into a fiber optic cable and sensing Raman backscattered light. It can measure temperature with 0.3K precision and a vertical resolution of 3m, generating a profile every two to five minutes.  A proof-of-concept prototype was developed under an EAGER award, AGS-1419932.  <br/><br/>FLOATS is deployed as part of the Strateole-2 field campaign organized by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, and the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamic (LMD) of the University of Paris-Saclay.  Strateole-2 is a five-year campaign, with a small validation deployment in 2018 and full science deployments in 2020-2021 and 2022-2023.  Balloons are launched  from the Seychelles (about 5S in the Indian Ocean), with the expectation that each balloon will circle the earth for up to 90 days and observe the TTL between 20S and 15N. This award supports US participation in the validation campaign and the first full science deployment, along with post-campaign analysis.  It is one of three awards made to US PIs for participation in Strateole-2, the full set being AGS-1643022, AGS-1642277/1642246, and AGS-1642650/1653644.<br/><br/>The FLOATS measurements are used to address three scientific objectives, all of which use temperature variations along the fiber optic cable to examine the behavior of gravity waves (wave motions in the air in which buoyancy provides the restoring force).  The first is the depression of the cold point tropopause (CPT) temperature by vertically propagating gravity waves, which is a key factor in determining how much water vapor enters the stratosphere through the TTL.  If condensation or sublimation occurs when relative humidity reaches 100%, then the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere should not exceed the amount corresponding to 100% relative humidity at the CPT temperature. Earlier work by one of the PIs and others suggests that wave-induced CPT temperature depression could be significant, and an increase in wave activity could be responsible for a substantial portion of the decrease in CPT temperature and stratospheric water vapor believed to have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century.   The second science objective is to understand the role of gravity waves in producing cirrus clouds in the TTL.  The problem is complementary to stratospheric dehydration produced by temperature depression, as water vapor prevented from entering the stratosphere by colder temperatures instead freezes out to form cirrus ice particles.<br/><br/>The third objective is to measure the vertical momentum flux associated with the waves.  These waves are critical for the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which can influence the skill of long-range weather forecasts.  Momentum flux would be estimated by combining FLOATS measurements (which give wave amplitude, vertical wavelength, and phase speed) with additional measurement taken on the balloon gondola including wave-induced directional displacement inferred from GPS positioning.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the value of the observations for addressing a variety of questions regarding TTL processes and the stratospheric QBO.  In particular, wave momentum flux data is of value for developing gravity wave parameterizations for use in improving numerical models used for weather forecasting.  FLOATS observations will be made available to the research community from servers at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder, so that they can be freely examined by the research community.  In addition, the project constitutes a demonstration of a novel technology for meteorological observations which could have a wide array of scientific applications. Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area."

Some studies have suggested that the jet may slow and change trajectory with ongoing and future climate change. Such behavior has been exemplified by the California drought, the eastern US polar vortex, and the winter storms in England in the winter of 2013-2014. Arctic amplification (the stronger warming of high Northern Hemisphere latitudes compared to lower latitudes) may drive jet stream variability in recent decades, but the role of man-made climate change in jet stream variability is contested and the instrumental period of measurement is too short to draw firm conclusions about current and future jet stream trends.<br/><br/>This research will reconstruct the latitudinal position of the jet over the last 500+ years using tree-ring records. The project will generate a new tree-ring based summer temperature reconstruction for the Balkans and combine it with proxy data from northwestern Europe to reconstruct the summer North Atlantic Jet. For the winter North Pacific Jet, the work will combine new winter climate-sensitive series from the northern Rockies with chronologies from central California. These two 500+ year-long regional jet stream reconstructions will be used to put current jet stream trends in a historical perspective.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of the education component of this CAREER award is the development of a new Global Change Analysis course that would offer training in quantitative methods to students across the broad, interdisciplinary global change research community at the University of Arizona.

Such grids suffice to capture the dynamics of cyclones, fronts, and other large-scale atmospheric phenomena, but these phenomena depend critically on processes with spatial scales much smaller than the grid spacing.  The small-scale processes must be represented indirectly, through parameterization schemes which estimate their net impact on the resolved atmospheric state.  For example clouds are typically too small for the grid spacing yet they are critical for moving moisture from the ocean surface to the mid-troposphere, thus cloud parameterizations play a key role in determining atmospheric humidity even on the largest spatial scales.  Parameterization schemes are inherently approximate, and the development of schemes which produce realistic simulations is a central challenge of model development.  Shortcomings in parameterization limit the usefulness of weather and climate models both for scientific research and for societal applications.<br/><br/>Most parameterization schemes depend critically on various parameters whose values cannot be determined a priori but must instead be found through trial and error.  This task, referred to as ""tuning"", is laborious as it is performed separately for each parameterization scheme and involves multiple integrations of the model in multiple configurations. It is also inefficient in its use of observations, which is unfortunate given the large amount of observational data available from satellites and other sources. The resulting parameter sets may not be optimal and may produce unexpected results when all the schemes interact with each other in global simulations.  Finally, manual tuning is not conducive to uncertainty quantification, which would be valuable for estimating the uncertainty in future climate change projections. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to replace ad hoc manual tuning with a combination of data assimilation, machine learning, and fine-scale process modeling using large eddy simulation (LES) models.  LES models have grid spacings of a few tens of meters and can explicitly simulate the clouds and turbulence represented by parameterization schemes.  These ingredients are combined to create a global Machine Learning Atmospheric Model (MLAM), in which LES models embedded in selected grid columns of a global model explicitly simulate subgrid-scale processes which are represented by parameterization schemes in the other columns. Machine learning is used to tune the schemes to emulate the behavior of the LES simulations, so that explicit simulations become an online benchmark for parameterization.  In this way all the schemes can be tuned together and interactively within a running global simulation.  Observational data from a variety of sources is assimilated during the model integration to provide a further constraint on parameter values, and estimates of parameter uncertainty are generated as part of the automated tuning.  A similar tuning process is implemented in an ocean general circulation model, and the two are combined to produce a machine learning climate model.  Model tuning is generally viewed as a necessary but mundane activity which is not in itself a research topic.  But a model capable of learning its parameters from observations and process models offers a new path forward, toward both better models and better ways of using models.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the societal value of better forecasts and projections from weather and climate models.  The work directly addresses uncertainty in forecasts and projections used by decision makers to plan for weather and climate impacts.  In addition, the modeling strategy developed here is applicable to a broad class of research areas which face the problem of relating large-scale behaviors to small-scale unresolved processes (the problem of relating genotypes to phenotypes in evolutionary biology, for example).  In addition, the PIs will establish a cross-disciplinary graduate program on data-driven Earth system modeling. The program bridges the gap between environmental and computational sciences which currently hinders progress in environmental modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PBO is a geodetic network with 1,100 GPS stations covering the Western US, designed to study the geology of the boundary zone between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates.  Although the GPS receivers were installed to monitor plate movements, the PIs showed under an earlier award (EAR-1144221) that the measurements can also be used to produce estimates for the above surface hydrology variables through a method called GPS Interferometric Reflectometry (GPS-IR).  GPS-IR uses interference between GPS signals received directly from the transmitting satellite and signals which are reflected from the ground before arriving at the receiver.  The reflected signal is sensitive to the moisture content of the soil and surface vegetation, as well as the change in effective surface height due to snow cover.  Work under the previous award produced a dataset with data beginning in 2011.<br/><br/>Work under this award augments the existing dataset by extending the period of record back to 2007 and by increasing the sampling rate at each site to daily or sub-daily frequency. The key to accomplishing these goals is the use of the L2P ""legacy"" GPS signals.  Because the L2P signals are encrypted and thus more difficult to use, the existing dataset was developed using the unencrypted L2C signals, which have been tracked at the PBO sites since 2011.  The backward extension of the dataset will be accomplished by developing more sophisticated algorithms which can be used with the L2P signals, available in the PBO archive starting in 2007.   A further issue is that the algorithms initially developed by the PIs were limited to use on signals transmitted from satellite positions in a somewhat narrow wedge of the sky to the south of the receiver. Improvements to the algorithms now allow the use of transmissions from a much wider range of directions, enabling an increase of the sampling rate to daily or sub-daily frequency.  Funds under this award support the development and application of new algorithms to augment the dataset, validation of the augmented data against in-situ measurements, comparisons between data generated from the L2P and L2C signals, generation of decade-long climatologies, and continued data collection throughout the period of the award.<br/><br/>The primary motivation for funding this work is the value of the dataset for researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders concerned with surface hydrology.  Surface hydrological variables like soil moisture, snow depth, and vegetation water content are essential for understanding the water cycle, yet they are difficult to make and only sparsely available.  The GPS stations of the PBO constitute a remarkable opportunity, given that the PBO is already fully established and funded for other purposes.  The hydrological data thus substantially enhances the value of the network with minimal additional field costs.  Beyond its scientific value, the data has high societal relevance given concerns in the western states regarding water resources.  In addition, the project will support a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate, and will also support student interns through the NSF-supported Research Experiences in Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESSES) summer program. Algorithms and data developed under the project will be freely accessible online."

Additionally precipitation is projected to become more intense, variability on all timescales stronger and significant shifts to occur in the seasonal cycles of precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow.  While these projected changes will have serious implications for water resources, agriculture, rangelands, wildlife management and natural ecosystems including forests, fire, etc. it must be noted that the model simulations of radiatively-driven hydroclimate change to data are not in close accord with actual change.

Most of the damage and fatalities were caused by violent tornadoes spawned by supercell thunderstorms, with six tornadoes receiving EF5 rankings, the most violent category of the Enhanced Fujita scale.  Last year, several outbreaks occurred with over 140 confirmed tornadoes rated between EF2 and EF4 that resulted in substantial damage and over 30 deaths. While significant advances in our knowledge of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes have occurred in recent decades, understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within supercells that result in tornadoes remains elusive. This void in knowledge is especially concerning for violent tornadoes that are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatalities and injuries as well as damage. Until these tornado genesis and maintenance processes are understood, our ability to forecast such events is severely limited. The primary goal of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding of processes underlying the formation and maintenance of tornadoes in supercell thunderstorms, especially as these processes relate to violent tornadoes. This knowledge is critical for improving tornado forecasts, tornado warning lead times, and estimations of potential tornado strength and longevity, and is especially applicable to tornadoes of strong and violent intensity. In conjunction with an awarded NSF grant providing continued access to the NSF-funded Blue Waters supercomputer, the research will analyze petabytes of data to study the processes occurring in supercells that result in tornadoes of varying strength, longevity, and structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Despite advances in observational and modeling/computing technology, much still needs to be understood about the evolution of tornadoes. Few computer simulations exist in which a well-resolved tornado forms within its parent supercell, and this work uses the highest resolution simulations of violently tornadic supercells conducted to date. A control simulation with 30 meter grid spacing has been completed where twenty fields in a volume centered on the tornado during its entire life cycle have been saved to disk every model time step, which will facilitate the most accurate analysis possible. 20 m and 15 m simulations containing long-track EF5 tornadoes have also been completed, and additional runs at these resolutions will be executed as needed. Tools to efficiently interrogate and analyze model data saved every time step will be improved and new tools will be developed. New simulations will be conducted in other environments in which violent tornadoes were observed. By analyzing simulated storms in different environments and comparing tornadogenesis failure cases to cases where violent tornadoes occur, the research team aims to identify processes common within unusually violent supercells involved in the formation and maintenance of tornadoes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>A better fundamental understanding of tornado development in supercell thunderstorms should help guide future field programs in which new features identified in these numerical simulations are targeted for study, and ultimately lead to improvements in our ability to accurately forecast significant tornadic events and increase tornado warning lead times. Improving our fundamental understanding of tornado maintenance, made possible through analysis of the simulations described, should provide insight critical for National Weather Service forecasters to better predict, once a tornado has developed, how long a particular tornado may last. This type of information is invaluable, especially when pertaining to high-end, long-track events. The improved understanding of tornadoes in addition to cutting-edge visualizations of this research will facilitate science education in forums ranging from formal courses for students to learning venues for the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theoretical and numerical analyses will determine whether or not Langmuir and Z-mode waves can explain the mode conversion processes need to explain the generation of medium frequency bursts.<br/><br/>Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and magnetic substorms have been identified as central problems to our understanding of near-earth space plasmas.  This project will examine the role that auroral hiss and medium frequency wave bursts play in M-I coupling.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this project in all aspects of the research, including the development of wave measurement instruments, the deployment of the instruments, the analysis of the data obtained from the instruments and the related plasma theory.  The majority of the research will take place at Dartmouth College and will offer opportunities for first and second year women to participate in the research through the Dartmouth Women-in-Science Program (WISP)."

The potential to use RF impedance probe techniques for measuring plasma parameters, such as temperatures and collision frequencies, has not yet been demonstrated due to lack of a sufficiently rigorous scientific model of the probe plasma interaction. Nonlinear properties of the probe plasma interaction are poorly understood and these properties have not been exploited. The first component of this research is to develop novel RF Impedance Probe techniques to obtain the probe-plasma frequency response in space plasmas. Graduate and undergraduate students will use the Universal Software Radio (USRP) hardware architecture together with open source software as a platform for the instrument related research. The second component of the project is the development of a theoretical and computational tool called RFPIC-PROBE that accurately simulates the interaction of the RF Impedance Probe with the surrounding plasma environment in order to analyze the frequency response data. The design of electronic circuits for space based measurements of plasma properties requires creative techniques to compensate for the quickly changing ambient plasma environment and to mitigate the effects of plasma interaction with a spacecraft. The research also develops mathematical and computational techniques to account for the gradual transition from collisional to fully collisionless interactions in ionospheric plasmas. The applications of this research range from space plasma diagnostics to laboratory plasma measurements and control of industrial plasma processes. The RF Impedance probe will provide a powerful means to measuring the properties of these plasmas. The RFPIC-PROBE software will be made available in the public domain under General Public License for use by researchers in different areas of plasma diagnostics. Graduate and undergraduate students will use readily available open source game engines to develop a real time space exploration strategy game where players choose instruments for missions to explore and probe the environments of different planets. As part of outreach, a workshop session will be introduced through the Alabama Science in Motion program to allow high school students and teachers to try out computer experiments to measure the properties of a hypothetical plasma medium. All results and data from this research project will be hosted on the world wide web, and made freely available for public or industrial use and collaboration."

Most of the damage and fatalities were caused by violent tornadoes spawned by supercell thunderstorms, with six tornadoes receiving EF5 rankings, the most violent category of the Enhanced Fujita scale.  Last year, several outbreaks occurred with over 140 confirmed tornadoes rated between EF2 and EF4 that resulted in substantial damage and over 30 deaths. While significant advances in our knowledge of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes have occurred in recent decades, understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within supercells that result in tornadoes remains elusive. This void in knowledge is especially concerning for violent tornadoes that are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatalities and injuries as well as damage. Until these tornado genesis and maintenance processes are understood, our ability to forecast such events is severely limited. The primary goal of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding of processes underlying the formation and maintenance of tornadoes in supercell thunderstorms, especially as these processes relate to violent tornadoes. This knowledge is critical for improving tornado forecasts, tornado warning lead times, and estimations of potential tornado strength and longevity, and is especially applicable to tornadoes of strong and violent intensity. In conjunction with an awarded NSF grant providing continued access to the NSF-funded Blue Waters supercomputer, the research will analyze petabytes of data to study the processes occurring in supercells that result in tornadoes of varying strength, longevity, and structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Despite advances in observational and modeling/computing technology, much still needs to be understood about the evolution of tornadoes. Few computer simulations exist in which a well-resolved tornado forms within its parent supercell, and this work uses the highest resolution simulations of violently tornadic supercells conducted to date. A control simulation with 30 meter grid spacing has been completed where twenty fields in a volume centered on the tornado during its entire life cycle have been saved to disk every model time step, which will facilitate the most accurate analysis possible. 20 m and 15 m simulations containing long-track EF5 tornadoes have also been completed, and additional runs at these resolutions will be executed as needed. Tools to efficiently interrogate and analyze model data saved every time step will be improved and new tools will be developed. New simulations will be conducted in other environments in which violent tornadoes were observed. By analyzing simulated storms in different environments and comparing tornadogenesis failure cases to cases where violent tornadoes occur, the research team aims to identify processes common within unusually violent supercells involved in the formation and maintenance of tornadoes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>A better fundamental understanding of tornado development in supercell thunderstorms should help guide future field programs in which new features identified in these numerical simulations are targeted for study, and ultimately lead to improvements in our ability to accurately forecast significant tornadic events and increase tornado warning lead times. Improving our fundamental understanding of tornado maintenance, made possible through analysis of the simulations described, should provide insight critical for National Weather Service forecasters to better predict, once a tornado has developed, how long a particular tornado may last. This type of information is invaluable, especially when pertaining to high-end, long-track events. The improved understanding of tornadoes in addition to cutting-edge visualizations of this research will facilitate science education in forums ranging from formal courses for students to learning venues for the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Determining the meteoric mass distribution is critical for characterizing the mass input into the mesosphere -- including the metal deposition -- which plays a significant role in the local chemical processes. The meteoric mass is then transported to the middle atmosphere, where coupling with the lower atmosphere occurs. The current models for predicting the speed at which this transport occurs are sensitive to small changes in the total flux of mass from meteors -- which is largely unknown over the observable mass range. The PIs approach of using both optical and radar techniques simultaneously will enable an effective cross-calibration of the two techniques for calculating meteor mass, resulting in a significantly more accurate estimate of the total meteor mass input. <br/><br/>In this study, simultaneous optical and radar observations of meteor head echoes are proposed to set constraints on luminosity and ionization efficiencies, respectively, in order to determine meteoroid mass in the 100 microgram to 100 milligram range. Current data sets of common-volume radar and optical observations of meteors from several different radars are be used to address the science goals. Additional campaigns are proposed at specific radar sites, in order to improve and enhance the meteoroid mass and flux estimates based on lessons learned and the limitations of the current data. The main result expected is the production of mass distribution indexes of meteors from the sporadic meteor complex. The use of multiple radars will allow different regions of the sky -- both Southern and Northern -- to be covered and enable the detection of a large range of masses due to the varying sensitivities of the radars. There is a lack of knowledge in several important areas in this whole process and the proposed research will be a valuable tool in solving several issues, such as the formation of noctilucent and polar stratospheric clouds and the presence of meteoric dust. As a result of the review process and careful consideration, this proposal is funded for a period of three years."

These records, which reflect average annual flows as well as periods of drought, have been used to allocate water resources and plan for future uses.  Tree-ring based reconstructions of streamflow have been used to extend records back in time.  The most well-known of these, for the Colorado River, showed that the period of flow used to allocate the basin's water supplies in the 1920s was one of the wettest period of flow in the past five centuries.  Reconstructions of flow for other basins, such as the Sacramento River, have shown that drought much longer than any in the gage records have occurred over past centuries.  <br/><br/>This research will use centuries-long tree ring records to reconstruct streamflow for the Missouri River Basin for gages from the headwaters to the confluence with the Mississippi River. This will be done using innovative statistical techniques based on Bayesian methodologies. To date, The Missouri River Basin is the only major river headwaters in the western US for which reconstructions from tree rings have not been generated. This knowledge gap is critical given that the region is facing an array of water resources issues that are challenged by hydrologic variability-- both floods and droughts-- over just the past decades. Providing a longer context for understanding past variability of flow and climatic controls on it, particularly at decadal and longer time scales, is critical for anticipating and managing water supplies in the future.  The Missouri River system is the life-blood of the American Midwest. The research team will collaborate with the US Army Corps of Engineers Institute of Water Resources and their Upper Missouri Basin Offices to develop and test scenarios of past tree-ring reconstructed river discharge that can be used for different aspects of the Corps' operations on the river system, leading to better multi-stakeholder discussions on how best to manage climate induced risk in the region.

The research explores the potential of publicly available paleoclimate records in combination with a proven modeling technique to address fundamental hypotheses about the time scales, stationarity, anthropogenic influence, and coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics of Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV).  The project is guided by three specific science questions and one far-reaching and overarching question.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the research seeks to address: <br/><br/>Question 1) What is the predictability of AMV as evidenced by proxy records? Do proxy records suggest mechanisms of coupled atmosphere-ocean AMV?<br/><br/>Strategy: To diagnose AMV predictability from proxy records, linear inverse models (LIMs) will be derived from marine and terrestrial proxy records. Eigenvalue analyses will be used to show dominant dynamical patterns and time scales, and marine and terrestrial records will be used to identify coupled climate variability. Forecast skill of models derived from proxies, modern observations, and output from the Last Millennium Reanalysis Project will be compared.<br/><br/>Question 2) Is AMV changing through time, and can we attribute changes to anthropogenic forcing? <br/><br/>Strategy: Non-stationarities in AMV, including possible responses to anthropogenic influences, will be explored using statistical tests, wavelet analyses, and eigenvector analyses of LIMs constructed over temporal subsets of the data.<br/><br/>Question 3) How do AMV dynamics in general circulation models and proxy-derived models differ? <br/><br/>Strategy: Dynamics responsible for AMV in proxy-derived LIMs will be compared to mechanisms for AMV in controls runs from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) archives.<br/><br/>The research is guided by the far-reaching and overarching question: <br/><br/>Question: Do paleoclimate proxy data have power to constrain AMV dynamics and predictability? <br/><br/>Strategy: If ""yes,"" then proxy records can be directly useful in making and evaluating modern climate forecasts, and the techniques can be expanded to other regions and time scales. If ""no,"" then the research will help quantify the limits of proxy records to assess predictability of modern climate, and identify new record types and sites to improve dynamical understanding and predictive power.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts involve supporting an early career scientist, helping reduce the uncertainty in North Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and providing materials to local STEM high school teachers and students through projects already in existence at the university."

Deep convection refers to the overturning motions found in cumulus clouds and associated with showers and intense precipitation. A central issue addressed by this research is the contrast in convective intensity between land and ocean regions, which can be inferred from the difference in lightning flash rate per unit rainfall seen in satellite observations from the tropics. The higher flash rate is generally accepted as an indication that the updraft and downdraft speeds above the melting level are are greater for convective precipitation over land, thus the flash rate serves as a proxy for the intensity of convection. It is sometimes assumed that convection is more intense over land due to higher values of Convective Available Potentially Energy (CAPE), but evidence for this claim is somewhat ambiguous.  Other hypotheses have been proposed, including one that the difference is due to the more intense surface heating that occurs over land than ocean for the same temperature and insolation due to the dryness of the surface, another that the heterogeneity of land surfaces is at fault, and a third that the greater abundance of cloud and ice condensation nuclei over land are responsible.  The working hypothesis here is that greater instability over land is in fact the cause of the intensity difference, but that a systematic examination of the full distribution of CAPE values is required, rather than a simple comparison of land versus ocean mean values.<br/><br/>Further research would address the aggregation of convection in the tropics, meaning the tendency of precipitating convective clouds in the tropics to occur in large organized aggregates.  The work begins from the observation that episodes of organized convection typically start out with a ""bottom heavy"" structure, in which most of the latent heat of condensation (released as water vapor condenses into cloud droplets) occurs at low to middle levels of the troposphere.  As the convection intensifies the clouds deepen and take on a ""top heavy"" structure, eventually forming a broad stratiform region near the tropopause.  The PI hypothesizes that clouds with a bottom heavy structure are effective in drawing moisture and energy into the region, thereby intensifying convection and leading to the development of deep convective clouds.  The PI argues that this self-amplification can be understood in terms of a ""drying efficiency"" which determines the gross moist stability of the atmosphere is above or below a critical level.  The research also considers variations in the effectiveness of this amplification between short-lived and longer-lasting convective aggregates.<br/><br/>The work is conducted through a combination of observational data analysis and numerical model simulations.  Simulations use a cloud resolving model, often in a channel-shaped periodic domain with an island on one end but otherwise covered by an ocean surface.  Observational data comes from reanalysis products and weather balloon soundings, and includes an examination of CAPE over land and oceans.<br/><br/>The research has broader impacts due to the value of understanding, simulating, and forecasting the intensity and organization of tropical convective precipitation.  This is clearly an issue of local concern in the tropics, and large regions of tropical convection can also influence weather in middle and high latitudes.  A better understanding of the aggregation and organization of convection could thus lead to improvements in weather prediction over much of the globe.  The work also has educational broader impacts, as the project will support and train two graduate students, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists in this field.  The PI also works with the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) program in Madison, WI.  EYH holds a one-day conference for that provides middle school-aged girls the opportunity to explore careers that use math and science."

How current sea surface temperature patterns may change under increasing greenhouse gas warming has therefore important implications for regional climate projections around the globe. A fundamental challenge in making such projections, however, is that the latest generation of coupled climate struggles to capture important aspects of the observed distribution of sea surface temperatures, confounding the interpretation of regional climate projections made by such models. The overall goal of the project is to evaluate the influence of coupled model tropical SST biases on regional climate and climate change projections around the globe. Through the use of atmosphere-only model simulations with specified sea surface temperatures, this project will first investigate how systematic biases in coupled model simulations of tropical sea surface temperatures in the current climate impact regional climates around the globe. The PIs will compare the regional climate response to the biases in tropical sea surface temperatures with the regional climate projections made by various coupled climate models to assess to what extent the regional climate projection uncertainties can be directly attributed to the regional climate responses to these biases.  To further substantiate the attribution by the atmosphere-only model, they will build a hybrid coupled model with prescribed oceanic fluxes in order to minimize the coupled model biases. The hybrid model will then be used to produce future climate scenarios under increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The future regional climate projections made by the hybrid model will be evaluated against their counterparts produced by fully coupled models. These two sets of innovative numerical experiments would help to narrow down the regional climate projection uncertainties.<br/><br/>In addition to building on our physical understanding of the climate system, key findings from this project will be highly relevant to organizations working on climate change impacts and adaptation.  Several of the project collaborators are already engaged with organizations focused on climate change impacts on agriculture and food security.  Elements of this project will also be used in the professional development of both current and pre-service high school science teachers across Maine through an established partnership with the University of Maine. Summer workshops run by project collaborators will be held with current earth science teachers to foster the use of project-related climate data in their classrooms. The PIs will do periodic follow-up meetings with these teachers to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the effort."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation. Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes. More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate. Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  Work performed under this award fosters international scientific collaboration with scientists in Colombia and Costa Rica and helps to develop local infrastructure for rainwater collection and isotopic analysis.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  Work performed here augments the aircraft observations through the collection and analysis of rainwater samples from ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. Vertical structure is a key property of tropical convection that determines its evolution and its interactions with the circulation and thermodynamics of the surrounding atmosphere.  The vertical structure can be simply characterized as top- or bottom-heavy, according to the relative amounts of rising motion that occur in the upper and lower troposphere.<br/><br/>Work conducted here seeks to determine the vertical structure of tropical convection by measuring the ratios of stable isotopes in rainwater produced by it.  Rainwater is almost entirely composed of ordinary H2O, but it contains trace amounts of water in which deuterium (D) replaces hydrogen (H) to form HDO, or oxygen-18 replaces oxygen-16.  These heavier isotopes condense more readily than ordinary H2O and are thus more common in raindrops formed lower rather than higher in the troposphere.  The relative abundance of heavier isotopes in raindrops should thus provide a means to determine if they formed in top-heavy or bottom-heavy convection. Rainwater collection for isotopic analysis is planned at three sites in Colombia: Nuqui, on the west coast; Quibdo, further inland; and Isla San Andres, in the southwest Caribbean. Estimates of convective vertical profiles from isotopic composition are compared with estimates from aircraft measurements to determine if the method works.  Further examination of the isotopic data would be conducted using numerical simulations from a variety of atmospheric models including some in which tracer ""particles"" representing water vapor are tracked as they rise through cloud systems and ultimately condense.<br/><br/>A further goal of the research is to understand the transition from shallow to deep convection, a critical component of the lifecycle of convective clouds.  Three contributing factors in the transition are examined: the gradual moistening of the atmospheric boundary layer; organization of the subcloud layer, which allows cloud roots to form in air which has greater moisture than the large-scale mean; and cold pools formed by convective downdrafts, which organize the subcloud layer to produce larger cloud roots which are in turn less susceptible to the diluting effect of dry air entrainment. The third of these factors may lead to a positive feedback, in which convective downdrafts organize the subcloud layer in a way that further promotes convection.  Better characterization of entrainment is of particular interest over the southwest Caribbean, as midtropospheric air in this region is quite dry yet convection still occurs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of this project is to build a state-of-the art instrument for solar eclipse observations that capitalizes on the unique diagnostic capabilities of coronal forbidden lines.  These lines are best observed during total solar eclipses, and they are used to explore the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coronal plasmas within the first few solar radii above the solar surface, where the solar wind and coronal mass ejections originate and are accelerated.

Coronal forbidden lines are best observed during total solar eclipses, and they are used to explore the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coronal plasmas within the first few solar radii above the solar surface, where the solar wind and coronal mass ejections originate and are accelerated.  Dominated by radiative excitation, emission from coronal forbidden lines in the visible and near infrared, as well as the continuum, can yield the chemical composition, temperature, density, non-thermal motions and outflows of the different constituents of the coronal plasma.  Valuable insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of the different manifestations of coronal heating processes can thus be gleaned.  Recent eclipse discoveries have shown that the temperature of the outflowing plasma is dominated by 1,000,000 K, while emission from closed structures and the bulge of streamers, is at 2,000,000 K.  They revealed that prominences, which are 100 times cooler and denser than the corona, are invariably enshrouded by the hottest material there, and directly linked to coronal structures, even when they erupt.   Chromospheric material from prominences escapes, unaltered, with the hottest coronal material in CMEs.<br/><br/>This project capitalizes on the pioneering insights achieved with the latest solar eclipse observations on 2017 Aug 21 of forbidden line emission, including imaging and spectroscopy.  In this project, the team will build a state-of-the-art instrument that expands the wavelength coverage of the existing imaging suite of Fe IX, X, XI, XIII, and XIV emission lines by adding lines from different charge states of Ar, Ni and S.  This enhances the diagnostic capabilities of the innovative imaging spectrometer to be built during this project by including the near UV and near IR wavelength ranges.  The upcoming 2019 July 2 and 2020 December 14 total solar eclipses over Chile and Argentina offer an opportunity for coordinated multi-site observations, which has been successfully proven with the observations acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse over the mainland U.S.  Multi-site observations, with identical instrumentation, maximize data acquisition and enable studies of changes in coronal structures on time scales of tens of minutes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technological assets that can be directly damaged by these, so-called, space weather events.  Consequently, predicting the occurrence and detailed nature of such events is of critical importance to minimizing their damage.  The characteristics of CMEs that determine their impact at Earth can change drastically if the CMEs encounter other large-scale structures on their way through the interplanetary medium, such as other CMEs.   Statistical studies indicate that interacting CMEs, creating so-called complex ejecta structures, are an important source for the most intense space weather events.   This project aims to investigate a multitude of ways in which these interactions can happen and reveal the resulting complex ejecta characteristics and space weather impacts.   In turn, this will contribute towards better understanding and predicting the formation of some of the largest geomagnetic storms.<br/><br/>The project includes significant science education and public outreach components. The PI and other members of the proposal team are contributors to the online website www.solarstormwatch.com, a website for real-time prediction with citizen involvement.

This will be done through:  (i) 3-D numerical simulations with a state-of-the-art MHD code of idealized situations, (ii) combined 3-D numerical simulations and data analysis of selected real studies, and, (iii) analysis of in-situ measurements.  Specifically, the ability to generate white-light images and in situ measurements will enable the inclusion of observational effects in the study when analyzing complex events and the validation of the numerical findings by direct comparisons between simulations and observations.  The investigation will address the following science questions: 1) What are the different manifestations of CME-CME interaction observed remotely and measured in-situ? and what is their origin?  2) How does the interaction of successive CMEs compress, accelerate, deflect and rotate the CMEs? 3) What are the similarities and differences between CME-CME interaction and CME-CIR interaction? 4) What makes complex ejecta and compound streams so geo-effective?"

Laboratory experiments would be set up to simulate the ablation of meteors by the Earth's atmosphere by firing projectiles with known mass, speed, and composition into a laboratory chamber containing a known density of gas. The observed relationship found between the luminous brightness of the simulated meteor with the mass of the projectile used would help enable the use of ground-based radar and optical meteor measurements to determine the masses of individual meteoroids with considerably improved accuracy. This result would then quantify the estimate of the total meteor influx of objects into the Earth's atmosphere. This research would be done through experiments at the University of Colorado's Institute for Modeling Plasma, Atmospheres and Cosmic dusT (IMPACT) facility in which the goal would be the recreation of the ablation process in well-defined laboratory conditions. These experimental results would then be applied to meteor observational data derived from both radar and optical techniques, in order to estimate masses of individual meteor events and to validate experimental and modeling results. This award would further support the education and training of a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D at CU Boulder. In addition, undergraduate students would be involved in the program through the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship Program (DLAP) at CU Boulder. The DLAP program provides CU undergraduates a hands-on research experience, with pay, culminating in a final research report and a presentation to faculty and graduate students in the program. Finally, results from the research would be integrated into a new undergraduate course entitled 'Space: Environment and Effects', to begin in Fall 2018. This course is being developed under the auspices of a campus wide ""Space Minor"" open to students in all majors; as such, this curriculum would reach students beyond science and engineering. Meteors make up a key component of the space environment, and so this research would be used as a key topic to underline the fascinating complexity of the near-earth space environment. The researcher plans to include lectures on simulated meteor work in this series.<br/><br/>Meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere with velocities between 10 and 70 km/s and masses from femtograms (fg) up to grams or larger; however, the total mass flux of meteoroids remains uncertain, with a range of estimates spanning two orders of magnitude. The ablation of meteoroids are suggested to be responsible for the creation of metal layers of the upper atmosphere, including atomic iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) layers that all peak within the range of 85-95 km altitude. These metal layers lead into a variety of aeronomical phenomena, including the nucleation of noctilucent cloud particles, ocean fertilization with bio-available Fe, and creating a relationship between stratospheric aerosol content and O3 chemistry. Moreover, meteors of milligram size and larger pose a risk to spacecraft orbiting the Earth, with the potential to cause physical or electrical damage. Accurate assessment of the total mass flux is critical to improving the understanding of each of these areas. The total mass flux error is primarily caused by the inability to determine masses of individually observed particles. The major sources of uncertainty that lead to poor estimates of meteoroid masses are uncertainty in the parameters which map the mass to observables, such as optical emissions and radar cross section. These parameters are the luminous efficiency and the ionization probability. The project would possibly provide the best measurements to date for a range of velocities and for different materials representative of meteoroids. The foremost science objective in this award addresses a simple yet critical problem in understanding MLT aeronomy: what is the total mass flux entering our atmosphere from space? The ability to create artificial meteors in the lab provides a great opportunity to engage with the community in a way that non-specialists can understand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A better understanding of meteor plasma dynamics and its radiowave scattering characteristics is needed in order to be able to utilize the information that radars generate about meteors.

(2) What characteristics of the meteor plasma influence radar head echoes? (3) Can more accurate theoretical and computational models improve our quantitative understanding of radiowave scattering? (4) How do large-scale atmospheric inhomogeneities and neutral wind shears modify the evolution of the long-lived plasma trail produced by the meteoroid? Answering these questions will lead to progress in understanding the physics of the highly collisional lower ionosphere and will provide better interpretations of measurements made by radar.<br/><br/>Beyond contributions to Aeronomy, the results of this work will be useful to space science and engineering, and provide a better understanding of potential hazards due to particles.

Since the Eemian warming occurred in the context of pre-industrial partial carbon dioxide (pCO2) concentrations, the research aims to isolate the response of dominant tree species to growing season temperatures that are comparable to those predicted to be normal by AD 2100. <br/><br/>The project takes advantage of recently recovered and well-preserved Eemian-age wood samples from Snowmass, Colorado available to this project through collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.  The Eemian wood samples provide a rare opportunity to explore how forests in the western U.S. have responded in the past to summer temperatures ~3-5C higher than today?s.  <br/><br/>Boreal forests play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and provide important macrofaunal habitat and ecosystem services. The simultaneous and coupled influences of warming, changes in mountain hydrology (such as the timing of snowmelt) and elevated pCO2 that are predicted to occur over the next century have led to widely disparate projections on the response of this ecosystem to global change. <br/><br/>The researchers will make sub-seasonally-resolved delta oxygen-18 and carbon-13 (d18O and d13C) isotopic measurements on modern and Eemian wood samples from species in the southern Rocky Mountains that were common during the Eemian and remain dominant today. These wood samples will be used to test how growing season length, water utilization (i.e., summer rain versus snowmelt) and Water Use Efficiency during the Eemian (i.e., warm temperatures and low pCO2) compare to today (i.e., ""cool"" temperatures and high pCO2). <br/><br/>This analysis will provide clarity on whether recent changes in a plant?s Water Use Efficiency is a product of the CO2 fertilization effect or from coupled changes in CO2 and temperature. In addition to the isotope measurements, the researchers will generate nested (50 km resolution) isotope-enabled general circulation model (GCM) simulations under Eemian and modern forcings to provide climatic inputs for the ecohydrological and ecophysiological process models used to interpret the proxy data. <br/><br/>The products of this research will be an assessment of how temperature-driven shifts in surface hydrology (snow and soil processes), atmospheric circulation (North American Monsoon extent and duration), and surface/leaf temperatures combine to improve or disintegrate forest health, including increases in large wildfires and rates of tree mortality in the western U.S.<br/><br/>The project will support two early career scientists working at the intersection of paleoclimatology, ecology, and climate dynamics.  The Chicago-based multi-institutional collaboration will facilitate undergraduate and graduate research opportunities in stable isotope geochemistry and climate modeling that are leveraged between institutions and are fundamental for twenty-first century scientific training.

This region includes the bands of maximum wind speed (the jet-streams), which act as a waveguide for large-scale atmospheric disturbances (Rossby waves) and govern in part the development of mid-latitude weather systems. It also couples the dynamical evolution of the stratosphere to the circulation near the Earth's surface on sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales. Chemical species of distinct tropospheric and stratospheric source regions are sporadically exchanged through the tropopause. The goal of this project is to study the dynamics of large-scale wave coupling near the tropopause waveguide, how this wave coupling is influenced by the background atmospheric thermal structure, and how it modifies the exchange of chemical constituents between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Different approaches will be used, including theory, observational data analysis, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>The results from this project will advance our understanding of climate- and weather-relevant processes in the tropopause region, including the processes behind the two-way coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. In particular, the project will lead to a better understanding of what drives planetary scale circulation variability in the stratosphere and how this circulation variability impacts weather near the Earth's surface. The project will furthermore improve our understanding of how the background atmospheric thermal structure near the tropopause influences exchange processes between the troposphere and the stratosphere. An improved understanding of the tropopause region is expected to ultimately lead to improved fidelity of models for weather and climate with corresponding societal benefits. The project will provide training as well as teaching and research experience for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, which will help prepare them for continued careers in science and/or education.

In recent years, there has been intensive study of how climate change would affect the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. However, only limited research has examined how climate change affects the important category of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics. One expected result of climate change is warming air at upper levels in the tropics; prior research demonstrates that this upper warming limits the strengthening of tropical cyclones that would otherwise occur. However, tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics may escape this mitigating influence. <br/><br/>Therefore, one goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that tropical cyclones exiting the tropics will show a greater intensity increase with warming than would storms that remain in the tropics. Another goal is to determine if and how warming changes the fraction of tropical cyclones that undergo the re-intensification process mentioned above. Finally, this project will also analyze changes in the locations and seasons in which tropical cyclones form. All of these goals will be accomplished using methods that are similar to what has been done in studying how tropical cyclones that remain in the tropics respond to climate change, but with a study area that extends well outside of the tropics. Highly sophisticated computer models, of the type used in weather prediction, will be used in combination with larger-scale changes obtained from climate models. Then, comparing ""present day"" to ""future"" simulations, with all else equal, allows determination of changes in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones moving poleward into mid-latitude locations.<br/><br/>This project addresses gaps in understanding of how climate change would influence the intensity and frequency of the subset of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics, affecting higher-latitude locations. This category of tropical cyclones is extremely important, because it is precisely these systems, as they exit the tropics, which exert the strongest influence on the major population centers in mid-latitude locations such as the US. Given their importance, it is perhaps surprising that the response of these systems to climate change has not received more research attention to date. The project will also determine if geographical and/or seasonal changes in tropical cyclone activity will change with the climate. Owing to the highly technical nature of this project, the graduate students who work on it will gain valuable skills in scientific computing, data analysis and visualization, and in science communication. Graduate research assistants working on this project will be invited to assist in supervising undergraduate researchers, thereby gaining experience in leadership and mentoring."

By making the award NSF encourages the PI and his collaborators to submit a set of proposals requesting support for each of the various campaign activities, which are reviewed collectively at a later date. This second round of reviews determines whether the campaign goes to the field and what elements of the campaign are supported by NSF.<br/><br/>The goal of OTREC is to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and their associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean.  The sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific has a strong north-south temperature contrast, with temperatures increasing northward from the ""cold tongue"" produced by the upwelling of deep water along the equator.  Winds near the surface generally blow in the direction from colder to warmer SST until they reach the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), roughly between four and twelve degrees north of the equator.  The ITCZ is a narrow region of cloudiness and convection which is generally regarded as a consequence of wind convergence near the surface.  But the PI hypothesizes that other factors are required to produce deep, organized convection and heavy precipitation found in the eastern Pacific ITCZ.  These other factors include atmospheric stability, mid-tropospheric vorticity (a term which combines rotation and horizontal shear of the wind), and moist thermodynamics, combined in a theory developed by the PI and others (see for example AGS-1546698).<br/><br/>In contrast, the southwest Caribbean is a region of uniform SSTs which do not favor low-level wind convergence, and air at mid-tropospheric levels tends to be quite dry.  These conditions are unfavorable for convection yet convection forms regardless, and the campaign seeks to understand the mechanisms through which the obstacles to convection are surmounted. One possible mechanism involves atmospheric motions forced by the adjacent Central American landmass, either by the diurnal cycle of solar heating or the blocking effects of topography.<br/><br/>A further issue to be addressed is the formation mechanisms of easterly waves, which are the most frequent weather disturbances in the tropical east Pacific and in the SW Caribbean. Easterly waves are westward-moving atmospheric disturbances with wavelengths of roughly 2,000km which appear on a weekly basis and sometimes develop into hurricanes. Easterly waves over the Atlantic and Caribbean generally originate over Africa (see for example AGS-1433764), but the formation mechanisms for easterly waves in the eastern equatorial Pacific are unclear.  OTREC campaign data would be used to determine the relative contributions of mechanical and thermodynamic mechanisms to the formation and intensification of these waves.<br/><br/>OTREC would use the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) as its primary observing platform.  The GV would be based in Costa Rica, allowing easy access to the east Pacific and southwest Caribbean.  Observations of winds, pressure, temperature and humidity would be taken using dropsondes, which use essentially the same instrument package as standard weather balloons only dropped from the aircraft with a small parachute.  Additional cloud measurements would be taken with a W-band radar mounted in a wing pod, and ground-based observations are also proposed for the campaign.  A key objective of the campaign is to determine the convective mass flux associated with tropical convection, as this quantity plays a central role in the theory of convective cloud development which the campaign seeks to test.<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays an important role in weather and climate, as it can produce extreme precipitation and develop into hurricanes with damaging impacts.  It can also perturb atmospheric circulation in ways that affect weather and climate over long distances, as can be seen for example in the effects of El Nino events on the continental US.  Thus research on tropical convection is of societal as well as scientific interest, as better understanding of tropical convection can lead to improvements in models used to forecast daily weather and anticipate climate variability and change.  The campaign would also have broader impacts through the development of international scientific partnerships with researchers in Central America, and would provide a valuable educational opportunity for graduate students in atmospheric science."

Specifically, the dynamical and neutral-plasma coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere would be investigated with a new resonance lidar at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska, that is a sodium resonance wind-temperature lidar (W&T) system that was recently relocated to PFRR and made operational with observations starting in January 2018. The operations of this instrument would acquire wind and temperature profiles through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of 80-110 km that would be coordinated with the on-going operations of six key instruments at PFRR: namely, the volume imaging sodium lidar, the Poker Flat Rayleigh density-temperature lidar, the Poker Flat metal resonance density lidar, a three-channel all sky imager, the Poker Flat Meteor Wind Radar, and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The research would have a variety of broader impacts addressing fundamental processes in fluid dynamics, aerosol and plasma science while developing new remote sensing technology. The W&T resonance lidar will be operated at the Lidar Research Laboratory at PFRR, and would support the participation of two UAF graduate students as well as visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. The W&T lidar system operations would enhance the Poker Flat Rocket Range research infrastructure, extending the cluster of ground-based suite of instruments at PFRR that would in turn allow new rocket-based investigations at PFRR. The activity will advance integration of satellite and ground-based measurements and inter-comparison, calibration, and validation of remote sensing techniques. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including the CAWSES, CEDAR, SEARCH, and SPARC programs. The results of the activity will be disseminated widely through both professional and public outreach programs associated with UAF and NASA. <br/><br/>The Arctic atmosphere can be considered as a unique laboratory for investigating atmospheric coupling and understanding how terrestrial meteorology forcing (from below) and space weather activity (from above) combine to determine the overall structure and circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere. The W&T instrument would acquire measurements of sufficient accuracy and precision to allow comparative studies of temperature and wind over daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. These measurements would provide excellent data supporting studies relating to dynamic coupling, ion-neutral coupling, and aerosol-plasma coupling. The program of lidar measurements would address these topics through observations of specific phenomena: gravity waves, tides, planetary waves, instabilities, mesospheric inversion layers, mesospheric metal layers, extended thermospheric metal layers, sporadic layers, Joule heating, ion drag, ion composition, and noctilucent clouds. The overarching aim of the series of observations would be to achieve a coherent framework for understanding these interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate scientists are engaged in significant effort to understand the decadal predictability of the climate system and to develop models to predict the climate on 5-30 year timescales. However, parallel efforts to understand predictive capacity of climate impacts and realize the full societal value of decadal prediction science has received little attention.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will utilize existing and developing dynamical models combined with observed data using advanced statistical methods to understand our predictive capacity for climate impacts on decadal timescales, and integrate predictive methods so that they more directly meet the societal needs for predictive information. The overarching goal is to transform how scientists from multiple disciplines and practitioners conceptualize decadal climate prediction, by enabling decadal predictions in decision relevant terms to improve planning and adaptive capacity for climate variability and change.<br/><br/>The approach follows in two concurrent parts. Understanding of current predictive information needs and usage will be developed in Part I across multiple high-impact weather and climate phenomena and across multiple stakeholder groups. The core research will take place in Part II and will identify our predictive capacity for the needed information through development of new combined statistical-dynamical modeling approaches that incorporate and are robust to uncertainty. An iterative process between information needs and information provision will promote effective integration of skillful predictive information with decision-making. A key project contribution is the development of a prototype generalized interdisciplinary research framework to integrate predictive capacity with decision-making."

Warning systems help mitigate the negative socio-economic impacts of natural hazards such as floods and tornados, which over the past three years caused 2303 injuries, 297 deaths and $8.5 billion in property and crop damages across the United States. As technology and its application evolve, and as our understanding of complex interactions among natural hazards, technology and human behavior improves, warnings must also evolve and change. This effort will develop a systems-level framework and underlying technology, firmly grounded in an understanding of human behavioral response, to leverage these changes to better meet the ultimate goal of improving safety for both people and property.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this effort centers upon development of new techniques for real-time, high-resolution nowcasts for rain and wind; creation of a new context-sensitive communication architecture for efficiently disseminating user-specific information tailored to various population segments; development and testing of new measures of human behavioral response; creation of a deeper of understanding of myriad influences on public response to weather hazards and warnings; and identification of new ways to link the social and technical components of the warning system. Research results will be integrated into the warning system based on time, space and risk considerations and demonstrated via prototyping next generation warning system concepts. Three key trends will be addressed: i) The rapid increase in ownership of mobile phones in all segments of the population; ii) New high spatiotemporal resolution X-band radar nowcasts (0- 1 hour) that can localize hazard risk and enable operational forecasters and emergency mangers to warn on a neighborhood-scale for tornados and flash floods; iii) New concepts for resilient data-dissemination architectures that enable targeting of weather information by context, such as precise location, or by demographics such as age. Live warning system experiments in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex will provide a unique opportunity to conduct empirical research, validate new technology and theoretical concepts. During severe weather events, high-resolution radar products will be disseminated to NWS forecasters who in turn will disseminate experimental geo-targeted, context-aware real-time warnings to individuals via mobile phones equipped with an app that logs information-seeking activity, communications, location, and movement, and enables post event surveys.

The work will address what  the impact of the solar irradiance on the structure of the geomagnetic field and underlying current system is, and how substorm thinning and dipolarization of the magnetotail affect the empirical picture of the geomagnetic field. The new model upgrade, which is aimed to answer these questions, employs multiple expansions of equatorial currents with different current sheet thickness values as well as an improved description of the field aligned current system. It combines the system science approach, when the evolution of a few global parameters of the magnetosphere is reconstructed empirically, with the physics-based approach, which is used to constrain spatio-temporal scales and structure of the empirical model."

This framework of large-scale field-aligned currents is created as a result of the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind.  The closure of these field-aligned currents through the polar ionosphere is responsible for the auroral oval.  Another consequence of the interaction with the solar wind is the extremely stretched magnetic field lines on the nightside of the Earth that form an extended magnetotail.  The stretching increases until the energy stored in the magnetic fields is released explosively and the stretching decreases.  During this time, the electric current across the magnetotail is disrupted and shunted through the high-latitude ionosphere forming the substorm current wedge.   This stretching-release-recovery cycle is called a substorm.  The interval during which the stretching increases is called the substorm growth phase; the explosive energy release is an element of the substorm expansion phase (or auroral breakup). The auroral breakup begins with a brightening of an existing arc near midnight close to the lower latitude edge of the auroral oval.  This is followed by an initially localized region of bright and rapidly varying auroras that spreads westward and poleward with time.  The auroral breakup is thought to be associated with the upward current leg of the substorm current wedge.  This study answers important questions about the connection between the large-scale current systems and the disturbed substorm currents associated with the auroral breakup using satellite observations of global field-aligned electric currents and ground-based observations of auroras and geomagnetic field disturbances.  An important element of this project is the unique global view enabled by new data products.  The project will have significant broader impacts.  Summer interns including high school science students and teachers will be involved in the research, receiving training on automatic identification of auroral break-up candidates and other aspects of the research.  In the longer term, an increased understanding of explosive space weather disturbances in the vicinity of Earth will improve forecasting capabilities of value to a technology-dependent society.<br/><br/>The primary objective is to determine how auroral breakups relate to the global magnetospheric current systems.  The methodology consists of case studies and statistical correlations of auroral breakup timing and location relative to the current systems.  This study is only now possible because of the groundbreaking development by the NSF-NASA AMPERE program of global maps of field-aligned currents on a ten-minute cadence utilizing existing engineering magnetometers onboard 66 commercial Iridium communications satellites.  These maps will be combined with ground-based maps of geomagnetic field perturbations from the NSF-NASA-ESA supported SuperMAG Program, which is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground based magnetometers.  SuperMAG turns these observations into global maps of magnetic field disturbances and other parameters that measure the level of geomagnetic activity.  Finally, auroral breakup images will be obtained from 20 THEMIS ground-based All Sky Imagers (ASIs) distributed across the entire North American polar region (some stations funded by NSF)."

Ionospheric scintillation refers to random fluctuations in amplitude and phase of radio signals traversing a region of turbulence in the ionosphere.  It impacts the power and phase of the radio signal and is caused by small-scale (kilometer to centimeters) structure in the ionospheric electron density along the signal path.  Ionospheric scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and, thus, can have detrimental impacts on satellite-based communication and navigation systems, such as GPS-based systems, and also on scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals, e.g. for radio astronomy.   The physics behind the generation of the plasma irregularity structures that cause scintillation is not fully understood, largely due to a lack of adequate observations.  An obvious consequence of this is that neither does a reliable capability exist for the prediction or mitigation of the effects of scintillations on radio waves.  ISX will generate an extensive dataset for applying diffraction radio imaging, which enables the prediction of scintillations at any frequency determined from the imaged structure, and potentially the mitigation of distorted signals by canceling phase fluctuations. Another broader impact of the proposed project is that it is a pilot effort to provide global, space-based monitoring of ionospheric radio wave distortion using signals of opportunity available worldwide. While a single spacecraft cannot provide real-time monitoring, it can show the way for a constellation of spacecraft to provide such a space weather service in the future.  Scintillation effects occur predominantly in the equatorial region in ionospheric density structures termed Equatorial Spread F (ESF).  The main goal of this project is to provide new observations on the structure of scintillation-scale ionospheric irregularities associated with ESF.   Specifically, ISX will simultaneously record scintillation patterns of multiple ground-based digital television (DTV) carrier signals. Scintillation patterns for a unique set of experimental geometries will be compared to determine how far along the magnetic field the turbulence maps, which is crucial observational data on the three-dimensional electrodynamics of these sub-km structures.<br/><br/>During the lifecycle of the project, it will provide extensive student training opportunities, including student involvement through Cal Poly spacecraft design classes and funded graduate students. Each year, 20-40 students will be involved in the design, fabrication, and flight of this mission. Cal Poly has flown many student satellite missions; the proposed effort will leverage the heritage and experience from all of these.<br/><br/>This project addresses the science question: To what distance along a flux tube does an irregularity of certain transverse-scale extend? It has been difficult to measure the magnetic field-alignment of scintillation-scale turbulent structures because of the difficulty of sampling a flux tube at multiple locations within a short time. This measurement is now possible due to the worldwide transition to DTV, which presents unique signals of opportunity for remote sensing of ionospheric irregularities from numerous vantage points. DTV spectra, in various formats, contain phase-stable, narrowband pilot carrier components that are transmitted simultaneously. A 4-channel radar receiver will simultaneously record up to 4 spatially separated transmissions from the ground. For most experimental geometries, the corresponding transmitter-satellite lines-of-sight will cross the same magnetic flux tube within 1-10 s, a reasonably short time to assume ""frozen"" irregularities. Correlations of amplitude and phase scintillation patterns corresponding to multiple points on the same flux tube will be a measure of the spatial extent of the structures along the magnetic field. A subset of geometries where two or more transmitters are aligned with the orbital path will be used to infer the temporal development of the structures. The radio receiver is based on the instrument developed and successfully demonstrated on the previous Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) NSF CubeSat project."

Recent research has identified remote radiative heating and cooling, for example the cooling effect volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols, as a driver of north-south shifts in tropical precipitation associated with the intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs; narrow regions of high preciptation over the oceans near the equator). Such shifts are implicated in the prolonged drought in the Sahel region of North Africa during the latter half of the 20th century, and could be consequential for other regions as well.  Research on the role of remote heating and cooling has also produced an explanation for why the Pacific and Atlantic ITCZs are typically north of the equator, and for the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ shown in proxy data from the last ice age, when much of the Northern Hemisphere was covered with highly reflective ice and snow. <br/><br/>The relationship between ITCZ shifts and remote radiative forcing is explained in terms of inter-hemispheric heat transport: if one hemisphere is cooled relative to the other heat will be transported from the warmer hemisphere toward the colder hemisphere, and atmospheric energy transport across the equator will take place through the  upper-tropospheric branch of the Hadley circulation.  But the overturning motion of the Hadley cell requires that as energy is transported in one direction at upper levels moisture must be transported the other way near the surface.  Thus moisture crosses the equator from the colder hemisphere to the warmer hemisphere, resulting in a shift of ITCZ precipitation toward the warmer hemisphere (in today's climate the Northern Hemisphere is colder on average than the Southern Hemisphere, thus the ITCZ is north of the equator).<br/><br/>This project continues the PIs' exploration of the relationship between radiative forcing, inter-hemispheric heat transport, and north-south shifts of ITCZ precipitation.  One key issue is that the theory assumes that cross-equatorial heat transport will occur in the atmosphere, and the theory was developed using atmospheric models coupled to ""slab"" ocean models which do not allow changes in ocean transport.  Preliminary evidence suggests that the extent to which the transport occurs in the ocean rather than the atmosphere depends on where the radiative forcing occurs, for example heat transport in response to radiative forcing in the middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere appears to occur primarily in the ocean, while radiative forcing in the North Atlantic yields more transport in the atmosphere than in the ocean.  The PIs perform experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to understand the dependence of the partitioning of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean and to determine how this partitioning depends on the region in which the radiative forcing is applied. Other issues pursued here include differences in ITCZ response when the radiative forcing occurs over land rather than ocean surfaces, and differences in the response depending on the magnitude and sign (heating versus cooling) of the radiative forcing.<br/><br/>Shifts in tropical precipitation are of great practical as well as scientific interest given the region's large population and vulnerability. Attempts to anticipate future changes in tropical precipitation rely on output from climate models, but such guidance is hampered by large differences in simulated precipitation change from one model to another.  A theoretical framework for understanding precipitation change is thus highly desirable.  Beyond the societal broader impacts of the research itself, the PIs perform a variety of outreach activities, including educational videos for grades K-12 and at local venues such as the Seattle Science Center.  In addition, the project supports and mentors a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing for the furture workforce in this research area."

As such, the research team argues that it is necessary to understand the origins, patterns, and amplitudes of climate variability at decadal to centennial (dec-cen) timescales. If dec-cen variations are weak, the team hypothesizes that climate change impacts on regional hydroclimate will likely unfold as a consequence of slow-varying changes in radiative forcing. If dec-cen variations are strong, however, then the team argues that the combined effects of atmospheric warming and natural variability on long timescales should be considered jointly in any understanding of climate.<br/><br/>The research team specifically seeks to quantify the amplitude of low-frequency hydroclimatic variability in models, proxies, and observations, while at the same time utilizing a new suite of last millennium numerical climate models produced by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They will apply both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques to this ensemble, including one ultra-high (temporal) resolution control simulation run and use these results to drive forward models of tree-ring growth. <br/><br/>Further, the researchers will reprocess all tree-ring width and density measurements from the Northern Hemisphere archived by the International Tree-Ring Databank to optimize the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability.  Both of these products - the high-resolution tree-ring simulations from climate models and the new dec-cen optimized tree-ring network - will be evaluated using a robust null-hypothesis for the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability. These activities will, in turn, improve the understanding of the full magnitude dec-cen variability, its spatial footprint, and its relevance to future megadrought risk.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts involve organizing two workshops for paleoclimate researchers and statisticians to explore new methods of inference from this dataset. In addition, the comprehensive analysis of dec-cen patterns across the North American tree-ring network will address directly the ongoing debate about the origins of temporal autocorrelation in tree-ring records and the potential confounding effects of biological persistence on climate histories estimated from this proxy. Furthermore, this project will support two graduate students in the course of the research."

It will lead to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of existing representations of atmospheric convection in major climate models in the world. As the global climate model grid spacing decreases to ~10 km or less, representing atmospheric convection in such models is a great challenge. The proposed work to use cloud-resolving model simulation of atmospheric convection to evaluate the accuracy and scale-awareness of widely used algorithms for representing convection is innovative, and will pave the way for further improving global climate models. The representation of convection and associated clouds strongly affects the statistics of extreme events in both current and future climates. It is also a major source of uncertainty in climate change projection. Thus, the proposed research will contribute to the simulation and prediction of the occurrence of natural disasters associated with climate variability at different timescales. The project will also contribute to educating future generation climate scientists through training of a postdoctoral researcher and providing learning opportunities for undergraduate summer interns.<br/><br/>The representation of the effects of atmospheric convection is one of the most challenging scientific issues in climate modeling. Over the last few decades, despite tremendous efforts going into improving the treatment of physical processes in climate models, major problems still exist in simulating important climate systems. These deficiencies are largely associated with the lack of accurate representation of atmospheric convection in the models. This project proposes to systematically investigate the criteria used for determining the onset of convection and assumptions that determine the amount of convective activity (known as closure assumptions) in representations of atmospheric convection using a hierarchy of numerical models. The goal is to evaluate the many different ways of representing atmospheric convection in state-of-the-science global climate models, thereby identifying their strengths and weakness and further improving them. To achieve this goal, simulations of atmospheric convection by fine-resolution numerical models that can resolve convection are used to evaluate the onset criteria and closure assumptions for convection. Statistical analysis methods, including skill score calculation, lead-lag correlation, and composite techniques, will be used to analyze the model output data. The simulations of convection will also be used to investigate whether the algorithms of representing convection in current global climate models can still be used when the grid spacing of the models decreases to ~10 km or less, the so-called grey zone scales, from the current spacing of ~100 km or larger. New ideas and formulations for representing convection in global climate models resulting from the analysis will be tested using the Community Atmosphere Model, CAM5."

These dynamic variations can cause disruption and degradation of communication and navigation signals that pass through the ionosphere. Although ionospheric irregularities were discovered in the auroral zone more than 75 years ago, fundamental questions about the way that the waves propagate and saturate in a turbulent state persist.  The purpose of this award is to investigate a particular kind of turbulence referred to as Farley-Buneman waves.  The objective is to study the internal mechanics of these waves, their effects on the background ionospheric state, and the interpretation of coherent radar backscatter that can be received from them. The investigation has experimental, theoretical, and modeling aspects as well as strong educational underpinnings. The broad goal of the research is to elucidate the processes involved in generating ionospheric structure by magnetospheric forcing (from above), one of the two main themes highlighted by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics. Its emphasis on the multiscale connections between the background forcing available during disturbed conditions, the auroral instability and turbulence it creates, and the feedback on the mean ionospheric state constitutes a systems approach to this complex and highly coupled process. The proposed study will be carried out by faculty and students at Cornell University and the University of Alaska, Anchorage, and will involve experimental field work in Alaska. Experimental data will be interpreted in the context of results from the theoretical investigation. One component of that investigation involves the construction of a 3D hybrid fluid-kinetic model of Farley- Buneman waves capable of simulating the wave mechanics at small and intermediate scales. The second component involves the development of a mathematical model of Farley-Buneman waves and turbulence, including saturation effects, based on the formalism of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The broader impact of this investigation is associated with the novelty of the tools that will be developed, which have applications outside research in the radar aurora. Radar imaging has tremendous potential as a means of performing discovery research in geospace but is computationally demanding and will see little application outside the current effort until it can be simplified and accelerated. Additional broader impact will come from undergraduate and graduate education in geospace and CEDAR science at Cornell and the University of Alaska."

The student projects involve numerical modeling, data analysis from space missions currently being supported at the CfA, such as Hinode, SDO, IRIS, Wind, DISCOVR, and Parker Solar Probe or engineering projects related to solar instrumentation being built at the CfA, depending on the students' interests and abilities.  With its strong Space Weather component this program has the benefit to society of adding to our understanding of potential space hazards. Moreover, this program will provide exposure to professional research in a university environment with a goal of helping students to decide whether to continue their education in graduate school, and whether or not to pursue research as a profession.  A student outreach component of the program will bring educational activities to the local community. The target group of students consists of undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines, with a preference for underrepresented groups in STEM fields and students from small colleges where there are few research opportunities.   <br/><br/>The primary goals of this program are to 1) develop students with demonstrated talent and potential by stimulating independence, creativity and cultivating an interest in physics, astronomy and engineering graduate school, 2) demonstrate to participants how academic knowledge acquired in classes applies to real-word research problems, 3) foster participation in scientific research by women and traditionally underrepresented groups in scientific research, 4) increase awareness of solar physics as a field of study, 5) develop student competence and confidence in presenting scientific research in a  public forum, 6) provide a high-quality research experience, and 7) accomplish state-of-the-art solar research.  Since the projects are designed to be part of cutting-edge solar physics research, student projects will frequently result in joint professional publications or presentations with their CfA mentors, providing undergraduates with valuable motivation and career development experiences. Since Solar Physics is taught at relatively few colleges and universities, this program provides an important service to the discipline. The proposal will encourage minority student applications through contacts with other minority-serving internship programs on campus, recommendations from professional contacts at minority serving institutions, advertising the program at conferences such as the National Society for Black Physicists, and a broad advertising campaign targeted at minority colleges and universities.

This general pattern has been known since the 1920s but the role of the clouds in cyclone evolution, and the effects of the cloud pattern on atmospheric circulation and climate, are still under study. The topic is of practical as well as scientific interest as clouds can only be represented in approximate form in current weather and climate models, and cloud errors limit the quality of simulations and forecasts. Results of the work have direct bearing on the quality of weather forecasts and climate projections used to provide guidance to decision makers and the public. In addition, the educational activities supported under this CAREER award advance science teaching at the high school, college, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>The research focuses specifically on cloud radiative effects (CREs), meaning the cooling caused by clouds as they reflect shortwave solar radiation back to space and the warming effect when they intercept outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the earth. In the deep clouds found in the eastern sector the longwave and shortwave effects show large cancellation, while shortwave cooling dominates in the low clouds on the western side. Preliminary work by the PI shows that, at least in the Southern Hemisphere, CRE evolves over the lifecycle of the cyclone, forming a north-south dipole during the decay phase with warming on the equatorward side. The north-south CRE dipole in the decaying stage could affect the meridional temperature gradient along the SH storm track, possibly helping to reestablish the meridional temperature contrast after cyclone passage and thus promoting further cyclone activity or influencing the latitude of the upper-level jet stream. The radiative effect of clouds around cyclones could also influence the behavior of low-frequency climate variability and secular climate change, both of which involve latitudinal shifts of jet streams and storm tracks. The work considers the dynamic and thermodynamic controls on the clouds as well as the influence of clouds on the midlatitude circulation. It is conducted through a combination of observational analysis and model simulation.<br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes efforts at the high school, college, and graduate level. At the high school level, the PI works with education experts at the Center for Teaching Excellence on the UVA campus, the Environmental Studies Academy (ESA) at Western Albermarle High School, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The goal is to develop a teaching module to introduce high school students to the role of clouds in the climate system. The module will be disseminated nationally through the web portal at UCAR. Undergraduate education is promoted through the development of a course on climate modeling and analysis. One issue addressed by the course is the lack of computer skills commonly found among undergraduates, which limits their ability to engage in scientific research. The course involves training in the use of data analysis software and hands-on projects conducted by groups of two to three students. Students from the class are recruited to conduct research in the summers, with emphasis on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities. On the graduate level, the project supports two students who, in addition to their research and classwork, serve as mentors for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation supports six ISR facilities worldwide. A community of highly trained scientists operates and uses the data from these radars; however, there is no clear path for graduate students to become a part of this community. While a handful of schools provide training in ISR studies, most interested students need to cobble together an educational path for themselves or pursue the program through a postdoctoral position. Starting in 2008, incoherent scatter radar schools have been held to provide an intense hands-on program that involves a radar experiment and lectures from experts in the field. Over the past five years, the program has proven highly successful and is always fully subscribed with both US and international students. Some schools have been held outside the country, and international collaborations on lectures and experiments have been developed. Many students trained in these schools have continued in the field and become a part of the ISR community. The collaborators on this award represent a core team of lecturers who have developed a successful agenda of courses aimed at imparting the core principles of ISR theory and experimentation during the course of one week. Five locations have been selected for future schools, based on proximity to radar communities: Haystack Observatory (Westford, Massachusetts), Arecibo Observatory (Puerto Rico), CONICET (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Geophysical Institute (Fairbanks, Alaska), and SRI International (Menlo Park, California). At each of these locations, students will have hands-on interactions with ISR technology, and will become familiar with a radar facility. The core goal of the ISR summer school is to encourage new participants into the field. Students who attended the summer school in the past have, in fact, continued on to propose their own ISR experiments, and have become active in the field. The awardees will systematically track the educational and professional trajectories of students who attend the summer school and send out yearly surveys to school alumni to learn their current relationship to ISR research and activity in the community.  They will also encourage select alumni to return to the school to act as mentors and student liaisons. Another important aspect of the summer schools is the mentoring relationships that are developed between established scientists in the field and interested students. Well after the program has ended, these relationships become a resource as students further their studies and enter the workforce. Students also form relationships with their peers, who provide support as they return to their individual institutions. In addition to the network established in the United States, the summer school has a strong history of international collaboration. The school has also been conducted jointly with the EISCAT summer school, where many European students and professors were in attendance. The two schools plan to merge again every three years."

One of the lesser-understood factors that influences snowflake structures, densities and number concentrations is wind.  Traditional methods to make ground or near-ground observations of falling or lofted snow in high wind conditions are difficult.  Newer instruments, such as those used for airborne research, are expensive or have other limitations.  In this project, the research team will deploy a new balloon-borne instrument to make measurements of snowflakes from the surface to the top of the precipitation layer.  A set of additional instrumentation will also be deployed to complement those measurements in a field campaign that will involve students from elementary school to graduate level.  The first order impact of the award will be to test a new, inexpensive technology for making measurements of snow.  The larger potential impact of the work would be to improve model representation of snow for improved weather forecasts.  The award also includes a significant education and public outreach component, leading to improved public understanding of science and training of the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>The main goal of this award is to improve observational knowledge of the microphysical aspects of snow during windy conditions.  It is difficult to make ground or near-ground observations of falling or lofted snow using traditional techniques due to blurring of the images, flow around instruments, and the lack of ability to vertically profile.  In addition, advanced instruments for snowflake classification are either expensive or unavailable for small deployments.  In this project, the research team will make use of a combination of instruments, featuring the Particle Size, Image, and Velocity (PASIV) probes developed at the National Severe Storms Lab.  The PASIV can be attached to a balloon for a vertical profile of particle counts and number concentration estimation.  At the ground level, the research team will make use of a camera-strobe light setup where the focal plane of the camera is 1-2m from any potential flow disruption.  Additional instruments will include a cloud particle imager and disdrometer.  The field site is within view of the operational WSR-88D radar and the UND C-band radar.  Overall, the design of the field experiment is set to answer two main questions:  1) How do microphysical properties of ice-phase hydrometeors vary over horizontal and vertical scales of 100m to 10km within falling and lofted snow events, and 2) How well do varying instrument designs function in windy environments?  The intended broader impacts include a significant outreach and education plan associated with the field campaign.  A graduate student will be funded by the project and approximately 20 undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the planning, teaching, forecasting, and collection of data for the field campaign.  K-12 outreach will include snowfall and visibility measurements made by students during winter events, the development of a winter-weather curricula, and teaching of the unit to tribal groups through partnership with an existing EPSCoR award.  Outreach via media and tours will also be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the dynamical and neutral-plasma coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere would be investigated with a new resonance lidar at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska, that is a sodium resonance wind-temperature lidar (W&T) system that was recently relocated to PFRR and made operational with observations starting in January 2018. The operations of this instrument would acquire wind and temperature profiles through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of 80-110 km that would be coordinated with the on-going operations of six key instruments at PFRR: namely, the volume imaging sodium lidar, the Poker Flat Rayleigh density-temperature lidar, the Poker Flat metal resonance density lidar, a three-channel all sky imager, the Poker Flat Meteor Wind Radar, and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The research would have a variety of broader impacts addressing fundamental processes in fluid dynamics, aerosol and plasma science while developing new remote sensing technology. The W&T resonance lidar will be operated at the Lidar Research Laboratory at PFRR, and would support the participation of two UAF graduate students as well as visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. The W&T lidar system operations would enhance the Poker Flat Rocket Range research infrastructure, extending the cluster of ground-based suite of instruments at PFRR that would in turn allow new rocket-based investigations at PFRR. The activity will advance integration of satellite and ground-based measurements and inter-comparison, calibration, and validation of remote sensing techniques. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including the CAWSES, CEDAR, SEARCH, and SPARC programs. The results of the activity will be disseminated widely through both professional and public outreach programs associated with UAF and NASA. <br/><br/>The Arctic atmosphere can be considered as a unique laboratory for investigating atmospheric coupling and understanding how terrestrial meteorology forcing (from below) and space weather activity (from above) combine to determine the overall structure and circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere. The W&T instrument would acquire measurements of sufficient accuracy and precision to allow comparative studies of temperature and wind over daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. These measurements would provide excellent data supporting studies relating to dynamic coupling, ion-neutral coupling, and aerosol-plasma coupling. The program of lidar measurements would address these topics through observations of specific phenomena: gravity waves, tides, planetary waves, instabilities, mesospheric inversion layers, mesospheric metal layers, extended thermospheric metal layers, sporadic layers, Joule heating, ion drag, ion composition, and noctilucent clouds. The overarching aim of the series of observations would be to achieve a coherent framework for understanding these interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lightning channel is composed of ionized gas or plasma, whose peak temperature is typically 30,000o K, about five times higher than the temperature of the surface of the Sun. Each year, some 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning discharges occur in the United States, and this number is expected to increase by about 50% due to global warming over the 21st century. A lightning strike to an unprotected object or system can be catastrophic. Lightning causes more fatalities than any other thunderstorm-related hazard, such as tornadoes and flooding. Lightning initiates many forest fires, and over 30% of all electric power line failures are lightning related. In the funded research, a new high-speed infrared (IR) framing camera will be employed for the first time at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, Florida for lightning observations in conjunction with the existing instrumentations, including the optical systems, electric and magnetic field measuring systems operating in different frequency ranges, and x-ray detector to obtain a view of lightning processes that has never been possible before. The IR camera will allow the imaging of lightning channels inside clouds that generally are not accessible to visible-range cameras. The lightning channel cooling process and the thermal energy input to different parts of the channel will be studied. The optical and corresponding GPS time-stamped electromagnetic field data will be used to develop, for the first time, a non-linear and non-uniform distributed-circuit model, which will allow the investigation of a variety of lightning processes, including the final-jump phase of lightning attachment to ground or grounded object, which has not been documented for natural lightning. <br/><br/>This funded research will further advance our understanding of the physics of lightning and its effects with important implications for environmental and climate change research and for mitigation of lightning hazards to people, structures, and systems. An improved knowledge of lightning attachment process is needed for designing adequate protection against lightning and for developing lightning testing standards. This project will involve postdocs and Ph.D. graduate students, as well as international collaborations, including two visiting scholars supported by their home Universities and a Fulbright Scholar. The research findings will be incorporated in the popular University of Florida senior undergraduate/graduate course ""Lightning."" The PI will continue to engage with high-school science education and public awareness of lightning hazards. Besides the Physical and Dynamical Meteorology area, the results of the project will be useful in other disciplines, including high-energy atmospheric physics, plasma physics, lightning protection and testing, and lightning safety."

On the longer subseasonal timescale, say between two and eight weeks, useful forecasts of mean conditions and the likelihood of extreme events may also be possible. But basic science questions, including the sources and mechanisms of subseasonal variability, their potential predictability, and the essential elements necessary for robust prediction, have not yet been resolved.  These questions are of practical as well as scientific interest, as guidance from subseasonal forecasts could have a variety of uses including agricultural planning and emergency management.<br/><br/>This project seeks to identify empirical predictive relationships between local climate variability of interest and large-scale patterns in relevant predictors such as sea surface temperature (SST), soil moisture, and atmospheric circulation. Prior work by the Principal Investigator (PI) and colleagues demonstrated such a relationship between heat waves in Texas, including the heat wave associated with the 2011 drought, and an SST pattern covering much of the North Pacific.  A key limitation to such prediction methods is that the observed record is too short to identify statistically significant predictive relationships.  Thus methods which seem successful when tested on past cases may fail when used for realtime prediction. The PI's strategy for circumventing this limitation is to identify predictive relationships using output from weather and climate models in place of observations, as many thousands of years of simulated weather and climate variability are available from a variety of modeling projects. Model output used here comes from the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME), the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Prediction Project, and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).  <br/><br/>A further concern in developing empirical prediction methods is the need for regularization, meaning a way to eliminate spurious small-scale features in predictor patterns which arise due to the large number of data points used to represent the predictor fields. Such features are not usually consistent from model to model or between model output and observations.  The PI uses a regularization scheme in which eigenvectors of the Laplacian operator serve to factor out small scales, leading to more robust predictive relationships.  To further ensure robust predictions, the PI applies an innovative cross validation technique which bypasses the best statistical model identified in cross validation in favor of the simplest model which is within a standard deviation of the best model.<br/><br/>Once robust predictive relationships are identified that hold across different models and in observations, the sources and mechanisms responsible for the relationships will be explored.  If the empirical methods can reproduce hindcasts from the models in the NMME archive then the model output can be used to understand the time-evolving dynamical processes linking the predictor pattern to the predicted variability.<br/><br/>In addition to the societal benefits of subseasonal forecasts, the project provides support and training to a postdoc, thereby promoting workforce development in this research area. The project also addresses public scientific literacy through public  seminars by the PI on sub-seasonal prediction, a topic of interest to the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By developing unique methods enabled by the new radio observing technique, the project will fill a major gap in the knowledge of the location and properties of the energy release site by tracing accelerated electrons, mapping dynamic shocks, as well as deriving energetic electron distribution and magnetic field in and around the flaring region.  It is expected that the knowledge gained from this project will impact not only the field of solar physics, but also many other heliophysical and astrophysical contexts where similar physical processes occur in the magnetized plasma.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will utilize a new generation of radio telescopes, including the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and the Jansky Very Large Array, to study solar explosions with a fundamentally new technique: broadband radio dynamic imaging spectropolarimetry.  This technique enables the capability of obtaining a high-resolution radio spectrum from every pixel of a radio image at a cadence of tens of milliseconds.  Complemented by multi-wavelength data in optical, ultraviolet, and X-rays, these radio observations will provide revolutionarily new diagnostic methods to probe fundamental physical processes behind these explosive events.  Topics of the proposed research project will be integrated into teaching and mentoring students at all levels.  A Solar Radio Laboratory (SRL) will be built on campus to serve as a new teaching facility for student education and hands-on training in both physics and engineering.  The PI will also contribute to the development of a new graduate curriculum in solar and space physics under the framework of the multi-institutional Hale Collaborative Graduate Education (COLLAGE) program.  The PI will create a course module for the COLLAGE program by integrating his specialties in high-energy solar physics, current research topics, and hands-on teaching/training resources enabled by the SRL.<br/><br/>Improved knowledge on the origin of solar explosive events is critical to understanding the basic science needed to meet the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, which aims to develop tools to forecast space weather and mitigate its impacts.  The experience gained from this project will also form the basis for developing the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR), which is a transformative solar radio telescope recommended by two decadal surveys for construction in this decade.  The educational component of this program will educate and train students at all levels in cutting-edge observations, instrumentation, and modeling through the SRL platform.  The development of the Hale COLLAGE Program will foster the growth of next-generation solar and space physicists by providing effective education and hands-on training for students at NJIT and other institutions.

Ionospheric scintillation refers to random fluctuations in amplitude and phase of radio signals traversing a region of turbulence in the ionosphere.  It impacts the power and phase of the radio signal and is caused by small-scale (kilometer to centimeters) structure in the ionospheric electron density along the signal path.  Ionospheric scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and, thus, can have detrimental impacts on satellite-based communication and navigation systems, such as GPS-based systems, and also on scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals, e.g. for radio astronomy.   The physics behind the generation of the plasma irregularity structures that cause scintillation is not fully understood, largely due to a lack of adequate observations.  An obvious consequence of this is that neither does a reliable capability exist for the prediction or mitigation of the effects of scintillations on radio waves.  ISX will generate an extensive dataset for applying diffraction radio imaging, which enables the prediction of scintillations at any frequency determined from the imaged structure, and potentially the mitigation of distorted signals by canceling phase fluctuations. Another broader impact of the proposed project is that it is a pilot effort to provide global, space-based monitoring of ionospheric radio wave distortion using signals of opportunity available worldwide. While a single spacecraft cannot provide real-time monitoring, it can show the way for a constellation of spacecraft to provide such a space weather service in the future.  Scintillation effects occur predominantly in the equatorial region in ionospheric density structures termed Equatorial Spread F (ESF).  The main goal of this project is to provide new observations on the structure of scintillation-scale ionospheric irregularities associated with ESF.   Specifically, ISX will simultaneously record scintillation patterns of multiple ground-based digital television (DTV) carrier signals. Scintillation patterns for a unique set of experimental geometries will be compared to determine how far along the magnetic field the turbulence maps, which is crucial observational data on the three-dimensional electrodynamics of these sub-km structures.<br/><br/>During the lifecycle of the project, it will provide extensive student training opportunities, including student involvement through Cal Poly spacecraft design classes and funded graduate students. Each year, 20-40 students will be involved in the design, fabrication, and flight of this mission. Cal Poly has flown many student satellite missions; the proposed effort will leverage the heritage and experience from all of these.<br/><br/>This project addresses the science question: To what distance along a flux tube does an irregularity of certain transverse-scale extend? It has been difficult to measure the magnetic field-alignment of scintillation-scale turbulent structures because of the difficulty of sampling a flux tube at multiple locations within a short time. This measurement is now possible due to the worldwide transition to DTV, which presents unique signals of opportunity for remote sensing of ionospheric irregularities from numerous vantage points. DTV spectra, in various formats, contain phase-stable, narrowband pilot carrier components that are transmitted simultaneously. A 4-channel radar receiver will simultaneously record up to 4 spatially separated transmissions from the ground. For most experimental geometries, the corresponding transmitter-satellite lines-of-sight will cross the same magnetic flux tube within 1-10 s, a reasonably short time to assume ""frozen"" irregularities. Correlations of amplitude and phase scintillation patterns corresponding to multiple points on the same flux tube will be a measure of the spatial extent of the structures along the magnetic field. A subset of geometries where two or more transmitters are aligned with the orbital path will be used to infer the temporal development of the structures. The radio receiver is based on the instrument developed and successfully demonstrated on the previous Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) NSF CubeSat project."

Pressure differences on density surfaces produce a pressure gradient force, which provides the kinetic energy that powers weather systems and the winds associated with them.  Recently the PI demonstrated that the interplay between baroclinicity and kinetic energy (in this case referred to as eddy kinetic energy or EKE), results in variations in the vigor of weather activity with a period between 20 and 25  days (see AGS-1343080).  The 20-25 day oscillation was documented in the longitudinally averaged EKE of the Southern Hemisphere and has an annular structure with peak amplitude near the center of the storm track.  The mode is thus referred to as the Southern Baroclinic Annular Mode (SBAM), and the PI has identified a comparable although weaker counterpart, the NBAM, in the Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Work funded here seeks to develop a physical understanding of the modes, using a combination of observational data analysis and model simulations to understand why the modes exist and what determines their periodicity, spatial structure, relationship to individual weather systems, and other characteristics. The work also considers the implications of the modes for practical weather forecasting, in part by examining their predictability in the forecasts archived as part of the Seasonal to Subseasonal Prediction Project (performed under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization).<br/><br/>The research is of societal as well as scientific interest due to the possible implications of predictable oscillations in weather activity for long-range forecasting.  The PI and his group also perform outreach to the local school district through presentations to students and teachers on the science of weather and climate.

Substorm disturbances produce a variety of environmental effects that can increase satellite drag, disrupt communications and navigation systems and induce currents in the solid Earth that are capable of damaging electric power grids. <br/><br/>A standard technique that the PI has used in the past is to perform a statistical analysis of the key indicators of substorms and their sequencing in time and space and compare this against various theories about substorm dynamics.  The recent development of a new substorm theory provides the motivation to incorporate both new and updated data sets into an expanded statistical study that uses newly-developed pattern recognition techniques to remove bias in the identification of observational signatures, and sophisticated correlation tools (for example, Statistics of Point Processes) to establish relative timing of physical processes as a function of substorm phases.  This study will make comprehensive lists available of time-tagged substorm signatures (i.e., auroral zone negative bay, midlatitude positive bay, Pi2 pulsations, geosynchronous magnetic field dipolarization, auroral kilometric radiation, magnetotail flows, etc.) and add to these the set of signatures implied by the new substorm theory (i.e., bursty bulk flows in the magnetotail, poleward boundary intensifications and auroral streamers in the auroral region, etc.).  The relative timing of features in the lists of observational signatures will be used to evaluate the evidence in support of the new and previous substorm theories."

Convection electric fields are generated by the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.  They are directed approximately from dawn to dusk across the magnetotail and drive plasma sheet ions and electrons from the magnetotail towards the inner magnetosphere.  Along the way, convection electric fields play an important role in energizing these plasma sheet particles to high energies and in delivering them to build the storm-time ring current, a torus of high-energy ions and electrons surrounding the Earth.  Convection electric fields also play an important role in the location of plasma boundaries, such as the plasmapause.  The plasmapause is the steep outer boundary of the plasmasphere, a dense torus formed by the extension of cold ionospheric plasma into the inner magnetosphere.  This torus expands outward to occupy the region where the corotation electric field (a radial electric field produced by the movement of magnetic field lines in response to Earth's rotation) dominates over the convection electric field.  In disturbed times, the convection electric field strengthens with respect to the essentially unchanging corotation field, diminishing the region where the corotation field dominates.  As a result, the outer regions of the plasmasphere are stripped away and convected to the dayside magnetopause where the plasma is lost.  However, the electric field is more complicated than the superposition of these two large-scale electric fields.  Changing magnetic fields produce electric fields through induction. During magnetic substorms, explosive reconfigurations of the magnetotail fields produce significant ""induction"" electric fields that introduce smaller scale temporal and spatial variability into the magnetospheric electric field. The primary goal of this proposal is to quantify the relative contributions to inner magnetosphere dynamics of convection and induction electric fields.  A more complete understanding of all components of the magnetospheric electric field is important for developing improved space weather forecast models of value to society.  This project provides support for the research career of a productive female scientist, and a research experience for an undergraduate intern as well as yearly outreach activities aimed at K-12 students, thus contributing to the future scientific workforce and science literacy.  <br/><br/>The primary tool for this investigation is a magnetically and electrically self-consistent model of the inner magnetosphere, the Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E). For storm events, measurements of the electric fields in the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere will be compared with the modeled RCM-E electric fields. Initially storms will be simulated with no explicit substorm magnetic field changes. The RCM-E magnetic field, energetic ion fluxes, electron densities, and precipitating electron fluxes will be compared with in-situ measurements by magnetospheric and ionospheric satellites. Finally, results of RCM-E geomagnetic storm simulations that incorporate the effects of substorm reconfigurations of the magnetotail fields will be compared with data to determine the role and importance of induced electric fields."

However, parallel efforts to understand predictive capacity of climate impacts and realize the full societal value of decadal prediction science has received little attention.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will utilize existing and developing dynamical models combined with observed data using advanced statistical methods to understand our predictive capacity for climate impacts on decadal timescales, and integrate predictive methods so that they more directly meet the societal needs for predictive information.

Our ability to skillfully predict changes in TC intensity is still limited, but recent studies have suggested that the radial location of deep convective bursts and stratiform precipitation relative to the radius of maximum wind (RMW) may play an important role in intensification efficiency. Testing these new hypotheses using mesoscale observations is needed to diagnose the most important physical processes responsible for intensity change and improve TC intensity forecasts.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Analysis of Doppler radar, dropsonde, satellite, and other observations will be used to examine TC convective and stratiform structures, their thermodynamic and dynamic environment, and their impacts on the TC circulation. Previous theoretical and numerical studies have suggested that convective heating and associated low-level convergence inside the RMW can efficiently intensify the maximum winds. Outside the RMW, mid-level inflow associated with stratiform precipitation can efficiently spin-up the broader circulation through convergence of absolute angular momentum above the frictional boundary layer. The research will use existing research observations at different stages of the TC lifecycle from intensifying and non-intensifying storms to test these hypotheses. A new variational analysis technique called SAMURAI developed by the Principal Investigator will be used to integrate aircraft and radar observations into three-dimensional thermodynamic and kinematic fields for analysis. High-resolution Cartesian and low-wavenumber cylindrical analyses with improved radar thermodynamic retrievals will be conducted and augmented with numerical simulations to improve our understanding of TC intensification.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This study integrates research and education by developing a new graduate radar meteorology course with a digital, interactive textbook, and incorporating mesoscale TC observations into physical meteorology curricula to train and encourage students to test scientific hypotheses using field observations. The open source SAMURAI analysis software and material from the digital radar meteorology textbook will be available to the atmospheric science community to enhance research and education infrastructure. The University of Hawaii at Manoa represents a demographically and geographically unique state in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, and the Principal Investigator is committed to improving diversity by including women and underrepresented minorities such as Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians in the project. Improvements in our understanding of TC intensity change can have a significant positive impact on society. The application of the findings from continued research on hurricanes and typhoons can ultimately help to improve our forecast ability and reduce life and property loss throughout the globe."

In the context of this past variability and the potential magnitude of future climate change, a refined understanding of the hydroclimate response to perturbation and of the underlying driving mechanisms is needed. <br/><br/>The research team aims to generate a set of multiproxy calcite and fluid inclusion records, resolved at the sub-decadal to centennial-scale, for four stalagmites from the central and southern Sierra Nevada, CA that span the last deglaciation through Holocene.  By integrating high-precision Uranium-Thorium dating, cave monitoring, multi-stalagmite records, and Earth system modeling (single-forcing water-isotope tracking simulations), the research team will (1) evaluate how North Pacific storm track behavior and the resulting precipitation signal is archived in the stalagmite proxy records, and (2) apply this knowledge to investigating the mechanisms underlying this precipitation response in the context of the changing environmental forcings of the past 21,000 years.  <br/><br/>Integration of the new Sierra Nevada records with complementary stalagmite records being developed for coastal and northern CA will permit a regionally expansive investigation of the mechanisms influencing storm track behavior and precipitation patterns in SWNA.

The SANSA and Padua expertise are essential to the project because instrumentation will be physically located at these two sites. The imagers were previously developed by BU and installed under separate funding. The Padua imager is the first continuously operating all-sky upper-atmospheric imager on the European continent.  With its conjugate imager at SANSA, the pair is positioned to shed new light on hemispheric asymmetries at altitudes where the atmosphere transitions into the space environment. The research team, one of the premiere groups in optical aeronomy, proposes to leverage the expertise of the international collaborators and the new type of data set to make important advances in understanding upper atmospheric dynamics. The project will provide an international research experience for a graduate student who will complete a doctoral thesis during the 5-year period of the project. The international collaborations with institutions in Italy and South Africa that will be supported by the project are both compelling and have strategic importance for developing observing capabilities aimed at addressing frontier issues in upper atmosphere - Geospace coupling.  In support of this effort, the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) is co-funding this project by supporting all requested international travel through the Global Venture Fund.<br/><br/>The target phenomena for this primarily observational investigation include: Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arcs, Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), ionospheric latitude gradients, and mesospheric waves - all dynamically important signatures of coupling between atmospheric and geospace regions.  Exploring the longitudinal and hemispheric differences in these phenomena has the potential for increasing our understanding of the dynamics of the coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere system as it interacts with inputs from space and from the lower atmosphere. The focus on a new longitude sector is important for several reasons. Moving between longitude sectors introduces a changing offset between the geomagnetic coordinate system that organizes space weather inputs and the geographic coordinate system that organizes diurnal and seasonal changes in the atmosphere.  In addition, upward propagating disturbances from the lower atmosphere due to weather systems or orography also change with location.   Geomagnetic conjugacy has the important effect of selecting locations where the space weather disturbance inputs are similar for a given event but diurnal and seasonal conditions are not.  The potential then exists to begin to separate out the effects attributable to the different types of inputs and their interconnections."

However, despite all the efforts devoted to investigating the SSW, two fundamental questions about this type of wind remain unanswered: (1) where does the SSW originate in the corona; and, (2) how do the coronal plasma properties determine the in-situ heavy ion composition of the SSW?  This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the coronal origins of the SSW in order to answer these two important science questions.  The project team will study the SSW, utilizing two completely different techniques: in-situ measurements of local wind plasma properties, and remote-sensing spectral or imaging observations. When combined together, these two techniques can become a formidable tool that allows the investigators to fully exploit their potential to study the origin of the SSW.  This project will benefit the solar research community and serve important educational functions.  By using two completely different measurement techniques, this project will serve as a bridge between two different solar physics communities that have been working in parallel with limited interaction: the in-situ community and the remote sensing community, and will thus stimulate a new wave of cross collaborations.  The research will be carried out at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where it will support undergraduate education through the University's UROP program and graduate education through collaboration with the graduate students in our department.

The in-situ solar wind observations will be classified based on their coronal origin types rather then their in-situ properties.  Back-tracking methods will be used to identify the corresponding source regions on the Sun.  The physical properties of the solar wind source regions will be determined using spectral line intensities.  This research project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the origin of the solar wind.

Industry, government and society increasingly require predictive information in decision-relevant terms to enable appropriate planning and adaptation to future hazards arising from climate variability and change, both to mitigate future costs and maximize potential benefits. Climate scientists are engaged in significant effort to understand the decadal predictability of the climate system and to develop models to predict the climate on 5-30 year timescales. However, parallel efforts to understand predictive capacity of climate impacts and realize the full societal value of decadal prediction science has received little attention.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will utilize existing and developing dynamical models combined with observed data using advanced statistical methods to understand our predictive capacity for climate impacts on decadal timescales, and integrate predictive methods so that they more directly meet the societal needs for predictive information. The overarching goal is to transform how scientists from multiple disciplines and practitioners conceptualize decadal climate prediction, by enabling decadal predictions in decision relevant terms to improve planning and adaptive capacity for climate variability and change.<br/><br/>The approach follows in two concurrent parts. Understanding of current predictive information needs and usage will be developed in Part I across multiple high-impact weather and climate phenomena and across multiple stakeholder groups. The core research will take place in Part II and will identify our predictive capacity for the needed information through development of new combined statistical-dynamical modeling approaches that incorporate and are robust to uncertainty. An iterative process between information needs and information provision will promote effective integration of skillful predictive information with decision-making. A key project contribution is the development of a prototype generalized interdisciplinary research framework to integrate predictive capacity with decision-making."

One of the recent technological advancements in tornado science is the use of dual-polarimetric radar data.  Dual-polarimetric radars transmit signals horizontally and vertically.  Through the combination of those signals, we can infer properties of rain, snow and hail, such as their size and shape.  It has been observed that there are specific polarimetric signals that show up prior to some tornado events.  This research award will investigate those signals to determine why they form and whether they are good candidates to be used as indicators for developing tornadoes.  The societal impact of the project is related to improving tornado warning times and increasing public safety.  The research team is also working with an author to develop a non-fiction book about tornado scientists, targeted at 8 to 11-year-olds, to enhance scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop conceptual models of recurring differential reflectivity signatures in supercells with potential prognostic value for tornadogenesis.

The researchers will systematically focus on the Zdr column and Zdr arc behavior immediately prior to tornadogenesis, comprehensively documenting and analyzing a sample of 8-10 supercells.  At least five additional tornadic supercells will be sampled using the UMass-Amherst phase-tilt weather radar (PTWR) during field studies during the award."

The rainfall anomalies are ultimately due to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation induced by ENSO conditions in the neighboring equatorial Pacific, but they may also be modulated by land-atmosphere coupling occurring over South America.  Here land-atmosphere coupling refers to several mechanisms through which the condition of the land surface influences precipitation, one of which is that soil moisture serves as a source of water vapor through evaporation and transpiration,  thereby promoting precipitation.  This sort of ""precipitation recycling"" can prolong and enhance dry spells, as lack of rain dries the soil and reduces evapotranspiration, leading to further reductions in rainfall.  On the other hand, a drier land surface can mean greater heating of the land surface during the day as there is less evaporative cooling, and a hotter land surface can lead to instability in the atmospheric boundary layer, which increases the chances of convective precipitation.  Land-atmosphere coupling can be quite variable depending on land cover and other factors, and can thus cause the rainfall response to ENSO events to be more spatially variable that would be expected from the large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies.  It can also cause changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of daily and sub-daily rainfall episodes within the period of a season or more during which an ENSO event takes place.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine the extent to which land-atmosphere coupling accounts for the spatial heterogeneity in the rainfall response to ENSO events over tropical South America.  The research consists in large part of statistical analysis of precipitation and atmospheric and land surface data for tropical South America, taken from satellite and surface observations and reanalysis products.  Parallel analysis is applied to model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5), including simulations from the subset of models which contributed to the CMIP5 Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE-CMIP5), in which models were integrated using climatological soil moisture so that land-atmosphere coupling could be assessed by comparison between simulations with interactive and fixed soil moisture.  The statistical assessment is accompanied by model experiments using the quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model version 2 (QTCM2), a simplified model which can simulate key aspects of the precipitation response over tropical South America, and in which key factors such as soil moisture, surface sensible heat flux, and the exchange of heat and water vapor between the boundary layer and the overlying free troposphere can be controlled and examined.<br/><br/>Work under this project has important broader impacts in addition to its scientific merit, given the substantial consequences of ENSO-related precipitation disruptions in the region.  The results of this study are also expected to shed light on the role of land-atmosphere coupling in other regions of the tropics where similar surface conditions prevail.  The work also promotes international collaboration, as it involves unfunded collaborators in two Columbian universities.  Aside from the broader impacts of the research, the project also supports undergraduate research assistants through the Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program, a 10-week summer program which focuses on students from traditionally underrepresented populations.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation of the scientific workforce in this research area."

As such, the research team argues that it is necessary to understand the origins, patterns, and amplitudes of climate variability at decadal to centennial (dec-cen) timescales. If dec-cen variations are weak, the team hypothesizes that climate change impacts on regional hydroclimate will likely unfold as a consequence of slow-varying changes in radiative forcing. If dec-cen variations are strong, however, then the team argues that the combined effects of atmospheric warming and natural variability on long timescales should be considered jointly in any understanding of climate.<br/><br/>The research team specifically seeks to quantify the amplitude of low-frequency hydroclimatic variability in models, proxies, and observations, while at the same time utilizing a new suite of last millennium numerical climate models produced by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They will apply both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques to this ensemble, including one ultra-high (temporal) resolution control simulation run and use these results to drive forward models of tree-ring growth. <br/><br/>Further, the researchers will reprocess all tree-ring width and density measurements from the Northern Hemisphere archived by the International Tree-Ring Databank to optimize the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability.  Both of these products - the high-resolution tree-ring simulations from climate models and the new dec-cen optimized tree-ring network - will be evaluated using a robust null-hypothesis for the amplitude and spatial structure of dec-cen variability. These activities will, in turn, improve the understanding of the full magnitude dec-cen variability, its spatial footprint, and its relevance to future megadrought risk.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts involve organizing two workshops for paleoclimate researchers and statisticians to explore new methods of inference from this dataset. In addition, the comprehensive analysis of dec-cen patterns across the North American tree-ring network will address directly the ongoing debate about the origins of temporal autocorrelation in tree-ring records and the potential confounding effects of biological persistence on climate histories estimated from this proxy. Furthermore, this project will support two graduate students in the course of the research."

The researchers plan to address the following questions:  (i) What is the structure of turbulence budgets, especially turbulence dissipation rate, within and above the valley? How does it change with the evolution of stability, particularly under stable conditions? (ii) What mechanisms generate intermittency of the turbulence? How is the intermittent turbulence within and above the valley represented in large-eddy simulations? (iii) How are coherent structures affected by the wind turbine wake? How does this influence intermittency? (iv) What physical parameterizations and numerical techniques are needed to appropriately integrate mesoscale and microscale models in complex terrain?"

The midlatitude ionosphere is as prone to instability as the equatorial and auroral ionospheres despite the lack of obvious sources of free energy, and there is no comprehensive theory to explain this. There is a clear relationship between neutral winds, wind shear, and turbulence and Es layer formation and structuring, but the causal links have yet to be clearly articulated. Equally clear is that E region irregularities and F region medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) and irregularities are electrically coupled, but the roles of the regions (sources, loads, coupled resonators) remain unspecified. <br/> This project will investigate midlatitude sporadic E layers, MSTIDs, the associated plasma density irregularities, their mutual coupling, their geomagnetic conjugacy, and coupling to the thermospheric neutral motion. The investigation will have experimental, theoretical, and modeling aspects. The experimental component of the research will be conducted in the Caribbean and will center on the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar. This radar will be supported by a coherent scatter radar imager fielded so as to have common E- and F-region scattering volumes with Arecibo. The project will also utilize the Arecibo lidars and all-sky imagers as well as sounders and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. The theoretical investigation will focus on the turbulence properties of the neutral motions in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region, which will be studied using a multi-scale analysis, and on the consequences for ionospheric structuring. Modeling work will incorporate a newly developed, fully three-dimensional plasma dynamics model. <br/> Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this work, and public outreach activities will be carried out in the Caribbean."

Existing NEON collections in northern temperate forests will be used as candidate sites to develop an enhanced algorithm for predicting biomass using fusion approaches between LiDAR and HS observations.<br/><br/>The partnership of the NEON AOP and the BB-FLUX campaign represents a novel synergy between previously disparate observation systems that introduces an inter-disciplinary approach for relating wildfire emission characteristics to the local ecosystems.

This challenge arises in part due to the central role that clouds and precipitation processes play in the tropical circulation. While there is much that remains to be learned about the processes that drive tropical rainfall, numerous advancements have been made in recent decades. For example, research has found that the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere plays a central role in the regulation of tropical rainfall. In spite of this breakthrough, our understanding of how water vapor, precipitation and large-scale atmospheric motions in the tropics occur remains limited. This study seeks to understand such interactions on perturbations in the atmospheric flow that are known as tropical disturbances. These include disturbances whose horizontal flow is largely rotational such as easterly waves, equatorial Rossby waves and monsoon low-pressure systems. These systems play an important role in the hydrologic cycle of multiple regions in the tropics, such as the Caribbean, and often develop into tropical cyclones, and have far-reaching impacts in the extratropics. <br/><br/>The research will provide important insights on the organization of precipitation in the tropics, which will lead to improvements in the representation of these processes in models.  Furthermore, because these disturbances sometimes develop into tropical cyclones, insights provided by this study may be of interest to the forecasting of tropical cyclogenesis. Results from the project have great potential to form a new general theoretical framework for tropical motions, which may be included in a course in tropical meteorology. A graduate student and a postdoc will be supported through this award. The knowledge gained from the research project will also be used for public outreach and general education.  <br/><br/>Novel statistical techniques will be used to analyze the interactions among water vapor, precipitation and circulation. The team will examine observational data and simulations from numerical models to obtain a lucid, clear picture of how circulations in these ""rotational tropical disturbances"" modulate the distribution of water vapor and precipitation processes. The study will elucidate the ways in which water vapor modifies precipitation, and how this change in rainfall affects circulations of these disturbances. The role that thermodynamic processes such as radiation and condensation play in this interplay will also be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a challenge problem to realistically represent/simulate clouds and cloud-aerosol interactions in global models of the Earth's climate system because they are very complex and usually much smaller than the typical tens of kilometer sized grid cells in current global models.  In order to limit computing costs, the present Community Earth System Model (CESM), which is one of the nation's leading global models, uses a minimalist representation of clouds by computing only their mean particle size and their condensed water mass.  These simplifications lead to a vast expansion of tuning parameters whose values are not well defined.  As a result, the current CESM cloud model predicts liquid cloud particle sizes that differ greatly from those observed by satellite.  The work replaces the CESM liquid cloud model with one that fully tracks the range of particles sizes in the clouds.  With full knowledge of the particle sizes much more complete and realistic cloud physics will be implemented in the model, and the number of tunable, poorly defined parameters will be reduced.  The new model will also be used to improve the parameterization of physical mechanisms.  Another goal of the  work is to link aerosols to the ice cloud model, and apply the ice cloud model to determine the role of new ice particle formation, particularly involving organic aerosols, in controlling cloud properties.  By utilizing the size resolved liquid and ice models, the study will evaluate the aerosol-cloud climate forcing, one of the most uncertain factors in climate modeling.<br/><br/>Cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions are among the greatest uncertainties in climate modeling.  By improving the physics used to simulate clouds and their interactions with aerosols the uncertainties may be reduced.  This project will improve representations of both ice and liquid clouds in CESM, test these changes against data mainly from satellites, and apply the models to well-defined, testable projects involving cloud-aerosol interactions.  This project will integrate research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning; broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the Physical Sciences by involving female graduate students; enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by further developing the CESM model; and, provide benefits to society by reducing uncertainty in aerosol radiative climate forcing resulting from a better representation of interactions between clouds and aerosols as well as by improving national tools to address such issues."

This sustainable web-based infrastructure for storing, sharing, and using atmospheric chamber data will synergistically facilitate atmospheric chemistry research in the U.S.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the project are to (1) provide a searchable public index of the chamber experiments from each participating research group; (2) archive past chamber data from each participating group under their indexed chamber experiment; (3) standardize chamber data reporting formats; (4) provide a uniform template for chamber metadata; and (5) streamline future data submissions.  The data products included in ICARUS are: (A) gas phase data that describes the time-resolved profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as gaseous hydrocarbons, oxidized VOCs, oxidants (OH, O3, NO3), NOx, SO2, and other data; (B) particle phase data that describes yields of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) as well as optical properties, composition (detailed molecular and bulk elemental ratios), and chemical functional groups; (C) supporting information such as relative humidity, temperature, and light flux; (D) the experimental notes required to understand the data (such as reaction timing, mixing procedures, seed particle addition, and so on); and (E) vapor and particulate wall deposition rates that are needed to correct chamber data.  At the end of the 3-year project, the database will be transitioned to the Data Stewardship Engineering Team at NCAR."

Understanding complex atmospheric chemical processes requires simultaneous measurements from numerous instruments, and sophisticated numerical models to bring the data together into a coherent scientific product. New to this REU site is the addition of 'Data Carpentry' components of training. Well established training sessions teach researchers best practices for data-driven research, which is essential for today's researchers employing large datasets (i.e. high frequency time series, remote sensing products, or complex modeling inputs/outputs). This REU site will recruit ten students each summer, over the next 5 years, targeting underrepresented communities in the Pacific Northwest as well as local community colleges. Workshops during the 9.5-week program, will train students in atmospheric chemistry, measurement and modeling techniques, data interpretation, and scientific communication. In parallel with these workshops, students will be trained on the specific research tools required for their individual research projects with faculty and graduate student mentors. The students will showcase their research during a final campus wide poster session for all summer researchers.<br/><br/>This REU site will allow participants to explore research on topics such as research foci include: 1) biogenic emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from forested sites, 2) impacts from natural and prescribed forest and agricultural fires, 3)nitrogen and carbon cycling from agricultural and natural ecosystems, 4) Smart Cities, 5) air quality forecasting and the impacts of climate change on future air quality, and 6) in situ and remote sensing of urban and regional atmospheric chemistry.   The overarching goals of this REU site are to 1) help students develop technical expertise, 2) engage students in authentic research, 3) help students understand the broader context of their research, 4) recruit a diverse cohort of students, 5) facilitate formation of productive and meaningful social interactions with faculty, graduate students, and fellow REU participants, 6) develop positive views about STEM by participants, 7) develop written and oral communication skills, and 8) provide opportunities for graduate school and professional development of participants.  The program elements and activities of the REU site are mapped to the 8 goals demonstrating how each program element contributes to the overarching goals.  Additionally, the evaluation plan is well designed to specifically evaluate the progress on the site goals.  This site will also explore participation by students that are place-bound, which if successful will open up a new model for broader participation in REU opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data assimilation techniques applied to the sophisticated dynamo models would benefit the broad solar physics community.  The scientific outcome of this project would be important for the studies in the heliosphere, the Earth's upper atmosphere, and possibly climate in the long-term, and it would be beneficial for current and future space missions and society.  <br/><br/>The research plan of this 3-year SHINE project includes the following tasks: (i) investigate the sensitivity of model predictions to uncertainties in observational data for various data assimilation methods and various reduced dynamo models in a dynamical system formulation; (ii) develop procedures to estimate the model parameters, system state, and their uncertainties; verify and test data assimilation procedures by applying them to simulated data and previous solar cycle observations; (iii) using current observational data, calculate predictions of the sunspot number and total poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components for Cycle 25, and provide uncertainties and confidence intervals; and (iv) develop a data assimilation procedure for long-term synoptic forecasts of solar activity by using 2D dynamo models, synoptic magnetograms, and meridional flow measurements from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and ground-based synoptic networks such as GONG and SOLIS.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the global solar activity, which is the major source of high-energy disturbances in the solar, heliospheric, and interplanetary environment.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.

The major scientific questions to be addressed in this project are: (1) What are the relationships between the isotopic composition of water and climate changes over the globe? (2) How does the climate system respond to changing climate forcings of the last deglaciation, and what is the contribution from each forcing: insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gases, continental ice sheets, and meltwater? The simulations will allow the study of the continuous evolution and abrupt changes of climate from interannual to orbital time scales. The type of transient simulation marks a transformative breakthrough in model-data comparison, allowing for direct data and model time series comparisons, and will have a significant impact on future paleoclimate studies using both models and observations. The proposed simulations will have a ground breaking impact on research in the paleoclimate community, providing model data for a number of other community projects. It will lay a foundation for a systematic test of future generations of ESMs with coupled cryosphere and biogeochemical models. <br/><br/>Specifically, the new version of NCAR's community ESM (CESM), enabled with water isotope tracers, will be run in fully-coupled mode for the period 21,000 to 11,000 years ago. The main simulation will be forced by prescribed changes in insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, continental ice sheets, sea level, and meltwater, while sensitivity simulations will investigate the effect of the different forcings separately. This simulation will be run at a higher resolution (2 degrees in the atmosphere and 1 degree in the ocean) than the previous generation transient model run with CCSM3 (3 degrees). Furthermore, stable water isotope tracers have been included in the atmosphere, land-surface, ocean, and sea-ice models and will be tested first for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) and present climate time slices before being run in transient mode for the last deglaciation. One central task of the proposed transient simulations is to explore a new paradigm of model-data comparison in close collaboration with the data community, focusing on direct time series comparisons of isotopes. The simulation of isotope time series will improve paleoclimate model-data comparison significantly, because it will reduce the uncertainties arising from both the inference of isotopes and the absolute chronology of the proxy records. The project will provide the basis for graduate research for students from the University of Wisconsin and Oregon State University."

The approach is based upon the tenet that prediction serves as the ultimate test of the scientific understanding of geophysical systems. Achieving accurate forecasting of near-Earth space environmental conditions would be critical to society needs regarding radio communication, navigation, positioning, and satellite tracking. Effective numerical prediction of geospace conditions would allow improved protection of important space assets and related systems in the event of natural hazards. A full time graduate student and two undergraduate students would be supported in this award. Coursework concerning data assimilation methodology would be developed that would also addresses portions of the modeling framework that underlies the inclusion of data from Earth and Geospace sensors.<br/><br/>The funded research represents a paradigm shift from a deterministic to a probabilistic modeling framework that possibly would be pivotal to the generation of foundational knowledge regarding the predictability of the whole atmosphere dynamical processes. This knowledge would facilitate optimization of observing systems and the targeting of observations to maximize data impact. The project strategies would develop the capacity to understand the role of uncertainty in constructing meaning out of ambiguous facts, which is also a central concern of probabilistic forecasting research. The ingestion of data from geophysical sensors into a comprehensive global circulation model framework using data assimilation techniques would provide significant enhancement of the accuracy of any forecast predictions generated. Thus, the funded research would provide realistic, global and instantaneous probabilistic perspectives on the day-to-day variability of the thermosphere and ionosphere, which up to now, have been difficult to assess. The project achievements in the data assimilation procedures utilized would be made accessible to the community through open source portals. Consequently, this project would help alleviate the geospace community's need for new research tools to optimally combine heterogeneous observational data from distributed arrays of small ground-based instrumentation with current and future satellite data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In parallel, the complexity and volume of the data have been increasing proportionally.  The main goal of this three-year project is to tightly couple these multi-dimensional observations with theory, analysis tools, and modeling to obtain new knowledge and make fundamental scientific discoveries in solar physics, particularly about the nature of the physical drivers of the solar activity.   The solar activity depends critically on coronal magnetism, which, broadly speaking, includes magnetic field generation, control of morphology/topology, temporal evolution, and transformation into kinetic, thermal, and non-thermal energies in the Sun's corona, as well as coupling between the magnetic and thermal structures.  The ability to measure the coronal magnetic field and its changes on dynamic time scales is critically needed to uncover fundamental physics driving solar flares, eruptions, and activity.  While reliable direct measurement of coronal magnetic fields has been lacking, this project aims to radically change the situation by taking full advantage of the large wealth of high resolution data and modeling that is finally becoming available.  Specifically, a practical opportunity for routine use of radio observations of the Sun's corona for probing the magnetic structures involved in solar flares has recently become available for the first time from the new, fully functional microwave interferometer -- the NJIT's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) -- which has started regular interferometric observations of the Sun.  To make sense of these highly demanding data, with progressively increasing volume and complexity, and to integrate these data into a full synthetic picture of the magnetic and thermal structure along with accelerated non-thermal electrons in solar flares, this project will utilize sophisticated models that combine the most advanced theories, computational codes, and simulation tools with the data.<br/><br/>This project includes broad dissemination of the new knowledge gathered in solar radio-astronomy to enhance scientific understanding not only in solar physics, but also throughout astrophysics.  The fundamental nature of EOVSA's observations ensures a broad impact on the field of solar physics, including future instrument development for the DIKIST, FASR, etc.  The work will result in user-friendly software tools that will be made widely available to the solar and space weather community through the Solarsoft IDL distribution library.  These modeling tools will be used during the summer internships at the NJIT's Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research (CSTR), where the project team recruits local junior high school students to participate in cutting-edge solar research.  In addition, being performed within highly diverse environment provided by the CSTR at NJIT, the various project activities will advance discovery and understanding, while promoting teaching, training and learning.  In particular, the easy-to-use tools to be developed during this project make great learning tools that will be widely used in graduate courses at the CSTR, such as ""Radio Astronomy,"" <br/>""Solar Physics,"" and ""Plasma Physics and MHD.""<br/><br/>The three-year project emphasizes the unique ability of EOVSA to quantify evolution of solar flares by dynamically measuring coronal magnetic fields along with the thermal and non-thermal electron distributions with high spatial and temporal resolution.  The project objectives include: (i) obtain evolving maps of coronal magnetic field and electron distributions in the flaring loops; (ii) build consistent evolving three-dimensional models of solar flares that, through forward fitting, simultaneously fit all available data, including the magnetic field, radio, X-ray, EUV and others; and, (iii) provide open access to these product to the scientists and the public.  The project team will adopt an integrated research approach that brings together new microwave imaging data available from the EOVSA, data from other ground-based instruments as opportunities allow, and data from the latest space missions, coupled with advanced modeling and forward-fitting, to obtain the three-dimensional magnetic field and particle distributions in flaring loops.

This proposal addresses two primary goals of PECAN: 1) To characterize the transition from surface-based to elevated nocturnal MCS structure and the interaction of cold pools generated by MCSs with the nocturnal SBL, and 2) to determine how the organization and evolution of surface-based and elevated MCSs are influenced by the stable boundary layer and the vertical profile of wind and stability above the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). To rectify the present paucity of detailed, integrated observations of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments, the project will observe nocturnal MCSs and convection with mobile ground-based radars, mobile sounding systems, and mobile mesonets in concert with other ground-based and airborne observing platforms during PECAN. Multi-radar syntheses, data assimilation, and modeling will provide the integrated analyses of these combined observations to evaluate the detailed internal structure of nocturnal MCSs and the impact of static stability, pre-existing boundaries, and wind shear on nocturnal MCS evolution processes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This project emphasizes the tightly coordinated observation of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments with an array of multiple mobile Doppler and dual-polarimetric radars in conjunction with mobile soundings and surface in situ observing systems. These observations will be integrated to obtain 3-D airflow syntheses, precipitation fields, and thermal structure of MCSs and newly initiated convection and their environments. Mobile radars are essential as they can provide enhanced temporal and spatial resolution and low-level observations over any area within the PECAN domain. C-band radars, with their ability to both penetrate heavy precipitation and sense clear-air inflow, are required. The mobile C- and X-band dual-polarimetric radars will provide microphysical information beyond the typical operating ranges and below base-scan altitudes of the polarimetric WSR-88D radars. The mobile sounding and surface observations complement the radar wind measurements by providing unique buoyancy and shear profiles both within and outside of precipitation, thus resolving internal MCS dynamics and characterizing the SBL environment that interacts with the MCSs. These data, in combination with other PECAN data from fixed and mobile ground-based radar, profilers, mesonets, and aircraft, are essential for interpreting nocturnal MCS evolution with respect to in situ environmental conditions and for providing input and validation of cloud dynamical-microphysical model simulations of MCSs. The scientific objectives of this project are to: (i) document the internal structure and evolution of nocturnal MCSs and convection; (ii) establish the environmental ingredients and related physical mechanisms that control nocturnal MCS evolution; and (iii) test hypotheses concerning MCS dynamical microphysical forcing and MCS-environment interactions within detailed cloud-resolving models. The research conducted here will advance fundamental knowledge of the internal MCS dynamics and interactions with the SBL and will enable better representations of both within cloud-resolving models.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Characterizing the morphology of nocturnal MCSs and the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and winds ahead of and near the convective region in the cold pool are essential to helping improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnoses and short-term predictions of the geographical extent and duration of severe weather, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and aircraft icing conditions. Additionally, these PECAN field observations will be essential for refining data assimilation systems and improving future operational numerical predictions of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments. The datasets collected here will also be used in university classes through graduate level. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the execution of a large atmospheric field campaign by being integrated into the data collection and post-field phase analysis. Lastly, the data collected here will be made available to other NSF and NOAA investigators identified as part of the PECAN project."

Yet very little is known about the climatology of HCRs. This oversight is worrisome as HCRs are present in convection-allowing models and studies suggest that these modeled HCRs can be caused by inaccuracies in PBL parameterization. The goal of the research is to use the Twin Lakes, Oklahoma (KTLX), WSR-88D to observe HCRs during the warm season and merge this information with ancillary data to develop a rich, multi-year data base for studying HCRs.  From the KTLX observations we will pursue the following scientific objectives: 1) Develop a 10-year warm season climatology of HCR occurrence frequency and characteristics (time of onset and decay, wavelength, orientation angle, year-to-year variability) using observations from April to September 2005-2014; 2) Determine PBL depth and mean PBL winds and wind shear using Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) or Rapid Refresh (RAP) analyses, and hence calculate HCR aspect ratios, for each day with HCRs; 3) Use Oklahoma Mesonet observations from three surface stations underneath the KTLX clear-air radar volume to calculate sensible heat flux and other surface parameters associated with HCR formation and maintenance; 4) Test and identify a robust automated approach to HCR identification that could then be used in a subsequent studies to extend the HCR climatology nationally using all available WSR-88D observation locations. The resulting large data set on HCRs will then be used to examine the mechanisms of HCR formation and help improve our understanding of this common boundary layer phenomenon.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The created HCR data set will be novel in terms of the number of cases (several hundred) and the richness of the ancillary environmental data on surface fluxes and PBL structure, and will be used to define the warm season HCR frequency, aspect ratios, orientation angles, typical onset time and longevity for the first time ever. These data will be incredibly beneficial to compare with the frequency of HCR formation in convection-allowing numerical weather prediction models. This type of comparison will help determine how well PBL schemes function as horizontal grid spacing continues to decrease below 3 km.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The project will enhance graduate, undergraduate, and precollege education, including the mentoring of a graduate student, graduate student participation in development of inquiry-based activities for undergraduate meteorology courses, and implementation of a week-long K-12 teacher workshop using adaptations of these activities followed by academic year support for K-12 classroom implementation. This will lead to enhanced K-12 teachers' and students' understanding of research strategies utilizing radar data to study mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and will increase graduate students' and K-12 teachers' understanding of the systems thinking involved in meteorological research, while also enhancing researchers' and graduate students' understanding of inquiry-based teaching practices and communication skills with non-technical audiences."

However, among recent efforts in hurricane forecast improvements, few studies have focused on landfalling hurricanes. This reflects the complexity of predicting hurricane landfalls and the uncertainties in representing the atmospheric boundary layer conditions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between landfalling hurricanes and the atmospheric boundary layer using ensemble-based data assimilation.<br/><br/>The study is based on two hypotheses: 1) the interaction between the hurricane and atmospheric boundary layer is an essential factor that controls the intensity and structure changes of landfalling hurricanes; and 2) the ensemble assimilation of surface mesonet and WSR-88D Doppler radar observations will improve the representation of near surface and boundary layer atmospheric conditions that interact with the landfalling hurricanes. Therefore, the research will incorporate the surface mesonet and Doppler radar observations with other available conventional and satellite data into an ensemble data assimilation system with the community mesoscale weather research and forecasting (WRF) model.  The following four scientific questions will be addressed:<br/>1. How does a hurricane's structure evolve during its landfall?<br/>2. How, and to what extent, do atmospheric boundary layer environmental conditions influence the intensity and structure of landfalling hurricanes?<br/>3. How do the hurricane vortex and secondary circulation interact with the atmospheric boundary layer environmental conditions? <br/>4. What are the processes that control the intensity and structural changes of landfalling hurricanes?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>The research represents the first comprehensive study of the interaction between landfalling hurricanes and the atmospheric boundary layer as well as the predictability of landfalling hurricanes using ensemble-based data assimilation. Results from this study are expected to enhance our understanding of landfalling hurricanes and also contribute to the overall goals of our scientific community in improving hurricane intensity forecasts.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Results from this study will facilitate the accurate prediction of hurricanes at landfall as well as their associated extreme winds and flooding rainfall events that have devastating effects on society and the environment in U.S. coastal regions. The broader impacts will also extend to educational goals, as graduate students will be trained during this research."

This award will make use of that data by conducting very small scale numerical modeling studies to determine what initially triggers the thunderstorms, a process known as convective initiation.  The research has the potential to improve understanding and modeling of these events, giving forecasters more information about when and where thunderstorms may happen.  The award would also contribute to human resource development by funding an early-career researcher, providing an opportunity for an undergraduate student to participate in a research project, and allowing the researcher to develop a seminar course based on the field campaign.<br/><br/>The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (known colloquially as PECAN) field campaign was conducted in the Great Plains region in June and July of 2015.  The campaign included numerous observational platforms, such as mobile radars, aircraft, vertical profilers and surface instrumentation.  In this project the researcher intends to assimilate data from the campaign into an ensemble with nested mesoscale and convection-resolving grids.  The primary focus of the research is to accurately reproduce the evolution of the nocturnal mesoscale environment in which convective initiation occurs and to determine which specific small- and large-scale processes result in parcels lifted to their level of free convection.  The ensemble data assimilation experiments will employ the WRF-ARW and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble analysis software configured as an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter.  Fifty ensemble members will be used and the researcher plans to employ a triple nested model grid strategy with the finest grid spacing of 0.4 to 0.6km.  In addition to the work on identifying processes triggering nocturnal convection, the researcher will also conduct forecast sensitivity experiments."

Understanding it, ideally to the point of predictive modeling of its response to changing solar wind driving conditions, is a central goal of magnetospheric physics.  The condition in the radiation belts at any given time is the result of a delicate balance between energization and loss processes operating on the particles in the near-Earth environment.  Neither of these is well understood at present.    This project will use new measurements from a NSF-funded CubeSat mission that was recently carried out together with numerical modeling to determine the energetic electron loss rate.   Only when the loss rate is accurately determined will it be possible to fully model the radiation belt dynamics. <br/><br/>The Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) is a tiny, so-called CubeSat, satellite mission funded by NSF and launched into a high inclination, low-altitude orbit as a secondary payload under NASA?s Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program in September 2012.  The entire CSSWE system, including its ground station, was designed, built, calibrated, tested, delivered, and operated by students, with mentoring and help provided by faculty and professional engineers at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at University of Colorado.   The satellite project far exceeded it?s expected life-time and has collected more than 12 months worth of high quality data on energetic electrons and protons in Low-Earth-Orbit.  The advanced data analysis to be done under this award will continue the exploitation of this unique dataset and, in turn, will help to maximize the scientific return on investment of this already highly successful CubeSat project.   For the most part, the scientific investigation is designed for and will be carried out by graduate students under the supervision of the PI and collaborators. <br/><br/>To date, the precipitation loss rate of the outer radiation belt electrons has not been quantified and resolved. The electron loss rates in current published papers are erratic and diverge by an order of magnitude. The goal of this study is to quantify the precipitation losses and their dependence on longitude, L, and MLT directly from the data with advanced modeling, thus providing a quantitative answer to the research community on this important issue.  Specifically, this effort will analyze over a year's worth of CSSWE data in conjunction with the NASA Van Allen Probes to determine the loss rates into the ionosphere during periods of gradual decay, during episodes of fast loss and during episodes of large gain. Analyzing CSSWE data during periods of gradual loss will determine how much additional energization occurs during such periods to maintain the radiation belts; analyzing the data during periods of fast loss will determine how much of the loss occurs by scattering into the ionosphere versus loss due to outward radial diffusion; analyzing the loss during periods of large gains will determine how much additional energization is needed to produce the observed gains in electron flux.  The impact of such precipitation loss to the overall dynamics of radiation belt electrons will then be assessed by comparing the measurements of CSSWE and the corresponding modeling results with measurements from the Van Allen Probes at the same times and locations."

The researchers are targeting three climatically-sensitive regions where tree-ring width (RW) records of this length are available in existing sample archives from the Gulf of Alaska in southern Alaska, Sukakpak in northern Alaska, and northwestern Canada (Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta). The resulting climate reconstructions will be compared with climate model outputs to examine spatiotemporal patterns in response to climate forcing (particularly volcanoes), identify uncertainties, and test hypotheses regarding internal and forced modes of variability.<br/><br/>This award will generate a suite of novel, maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies for these sites using the Blue Intensity (BI) parameter, which is substantially less costly and labor intensive yet retains the accuracy and resolution of traditional MXD techniques. There are few sub-millennial to millennial scale MXD-based chronologies currently existing for this vast region.  The researchers argue that the resulting BI chronologies, based on living and subfossil wood material, will yield robust records of past climatic extremes, trends and shifts in past temperature, spatiotemporal expressions of internal Pacific variability, as well as details regarding the external climate forcing over northwestern North America for the past millennium. <br/><br/>The research project has broad impact in four key aspects, namely:<br/><br/>First, this project will synthesize a network of climatically-sensitive tree-ring records from across northwestern North America to yield high-resolution, strongly calibrated reconstructions on past climate variability from intra-seasonal to Decadal to Centennial time scales. These dendroclimatic reconstructions will mainly be developed using existing data that will be processed to extract new information using the new BI technique, along with the development of field temperature reconstructions. Tree-ring data will be compared to model output and other proxy records and made available to the modeling community. This research will help advance a broader understanding of the long-term variability of climate over the past millennium for one of the most rapidly changing regions of the globe.<br/><br/>Second, scientific results from the project will be archived and provided to the scientific community through the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB).  <br/><br/>Third, as appropriate, the researchers will engage with native groups in Alaska. In the past, the PIs have interacted extensively with northern communities by involving native peoples in research and plan to continue to do so for this project.  The potential research outcomes could have relevance to native populations and the data and interpretations will be available to relevant communities (community groups, e.g. Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Cooperative, http://www.taiga.net/coop/index.html).<br/><br/>Fourth, the project will support undergraduate and graduate students as part of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and the student program at The College of Wooster. The support of undergraduate students would allow for an early experience in research."

This proposal addresses two primary goals of PECAN: 1) To characterize the transition from surface-based to elevated nocturnal MCS structure and the interaction of cold pools generated by MCSs with the nocturnal SBL, and 2) to determine how the organization and evolution of surface-based and elevated MCSs are influenced by the stable boundary layer and the vertical profile of wind and stability above the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). To rectify the present paucity of detailed, integrated observations of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments, the project will observe nocturnal MCSs and convection with mobile ground-based radars, mobile sounding systems, and mobile mesonets in concert with other ground-based and airborne observing platforms during PECAN. Multi-radar syntheses, data assimilation, and modeling will provide the integrated analyses of these combined observations to evaluate the detailed internal structure of nocturnal MCSs and the impact of static stability, pre-existing boundaries, and wind shear on nocturnal MCS evolution processes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This project emphasizes the tightly coordinated observation of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments with an array of multiple mobile Doppler and dual-polarimetric radars in conjunction with mobile soundings and surface in situ observing systems. These observations will be integrated to obtain 3-D airflow syntheses, precipitation fields, and thermal structure of MCSs and newly initiated convection and their environments. Mobile radars are essential as they can provide enhanced temporal and spatial resolution and low-level observations over any area within the PECAN domain. C-band radars, with their ability to both penetrate heavy precipitation and sense clear-air inflow, are required. The mobile C- and X-band dual-polarimetric radars will provide microphysical information beyond the typical operating ranges and below base-scan altitudes of the polarimetric WSR-88D radars. The mobile sounding and surface observations complement the radar wind measurements by providing unique buoyancy and shear profiles both within and outside of precipitation, thus resolving internal MCS dynamics and characterizing the SBL environment that interacts with the MCSs. These data, in combination with other PECAN data from fixed and mobile ground-based radar, profilers, mesonets, and aircraft, are essential for interpreting nocturnal MCS evolution with respect to in situ environmental conditions and for providing input and validation of cloud dynamical-microphysical model simulations of MCSs. The scientific objectives of this project are to: (i) document the internal structure and evolution of nocturnal MCSs and convection; (ii) establish the environmental ingredients and related physical mechanisms that control nocturnal MCS evolution; and (iii) test hypotheses concerning MCS dynamical microphysical forcing and MCS-environment interactions within detailed cloud-resolving models. The research conducted here will advance fundamental knowledge of the internal MCS dynamics and interactions with the SBL and will enable better representations of both within cloud-resolving models.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Characterizing the morphology of nocturnal MCSs and the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and winds ahead of and near the convective region in the cold pool are essential to helping improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnoses and short-term predictions of the geographical extent and duration of severe weather, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and aircraft icing conditions. Additionally, these PECAN field observations will be essential for refining data assimilation systems and improving future operational numerical predictions of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments. The datasets collected here will also be used in university classes through graduate level. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the execution of a large atmospheric field campaign by being integrated into the data collection and post-field phase analysis.

The major scientific questions to be addressed in this project are: (1) What are the relationships between the isotopic composition of water and climate changes over the globe? (2) How does the climate system respond to changing climate forcings of the last deglaciation, and what is the contribution from each forcing: insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gases, continental ice sheets, and meltwater? The simulations will allow the study of the continuous evolution and abrupt changes of climate from interannual to orbital time scales. The type of transient simulation marks a transformative breakthrough in model-data comparison, allowing for direct data and model time series comparisons, and will have a significant impact on future paleoclimate studies using both models and observations. The proposed simulations will have a ground breaking impact on research in the paleoclimate community, providing model data for a number of other community projects. It will lay a foundation for a systematic test of future generations of ESMs with coupled cryosphere and biogeochemical models. <br/><br/>Specifically, the new version of NCAR's community ESM (CESM), enabled with water isotope tracers, will be run in fully-coupled mode for the period 21,000 to 11,000 years ago. The main simulation will be forced by prescribed changes in insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, continental ice sheets, sea level, and meltwater, while sensitivity simulations will investigate the effect of the different forcings separately. This simulation will be run at a higher resolution (2 degrees in the atmosphere and 1 degree in the ocean) than the previous generation transient model run with CCSM3 (3 degrees). Furthermore, stable water isotope tracers have been included in the atmosphere, land-surface, ocean, and sea-ice models and will be tested first for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) and present climate time slices before being run in transient mode for the last deglaciation. One central task of the proposed transient simulations is to explore a new paradigm of model-data comparison in close collaboration with the data community, focusing on direct time series comparisons of isotopes. The simulation of isotope time series will improve paleoclimate model-data comparison significantly, because it will reduce the uncertainties arising from both the inference of isotopes and the absolute chronology of the proxy records. The project will provide the basis for graduate research for students from the University of Wisconsin and Oregon State University."

To rectify the present paucity of detailed, integrated observations of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments, the project will observe nocturnal MCSs and convection with mobile ground-based radars, mobile sounding systems, and mobile mesonets in concert with other ground-based and airborne observing platforms during PECAN.

The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an envelope of organized convection that propagates from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and constitutes the dominant form of intraseasonal precipitation and atmospheric circulation variability in the tropics. The MJO influences a variety of tropical weather and climate phenomena,including tropical cyclones (affecting hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico), the onset and intraseasonal fluctuations of the monsoons and rainfall over Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas, and the onset of El Nino events. Two complete MJO cycles were observed during DYNAMO.<br/><br/>Data for this project come from a 6-station network of radiosonde (weather balloon) stations which were organized and co-managed by the PI during DYNAMO,  augmented by a number of other Priority Sounding Sites throughout the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.  The overall goal of the proposal is to use the sounding data, after some additional processing and in concert with other DYNAMO observations, to examine the processes associated with the evolution of atmospheric moisture during the MJO lifecycle.  Preliminary results show that there was a gradual increase in lower to middle tropospheric relative humidity leading up to the initiation of both MJO events, and this project seeks to identify the mechanisms leading to the build-up.  One avenue to address this question is the development of moisture budgets from the sounding data,  another is the use of radar data from the campaign to assess the contribution of clouds of various types to atmospheric moistening.  Additional work will consider the role of the diurnal cycles of sea surface temperature and non-precipitating clouds, and variations in the depth of the atmospheric mixed layer (the layer of the atmosphere in contact with, and strongly influenced by, the underlying sea surface).<br/><br/>Despite its importance and concerted efforts over several decades, the MJO has not yet been adequately explained, and global atmospheric circulation models have difficulty simulating and predicting it. The research thus has societal broader impacts as it is expected to contribute to improved understanding and prediction of MJO events.  More specifically, the PI will work with modeling centers around the world to enhance MJO prediction, most importantly by providing data products for their use such as large-scale forcing fields for use in numerical simulations of MJO initiation.  The PI notes that all radiosonde data collected through his DYNAMO sub-project will be hosted on several websites, and work funded here would enhance that data through quality control, removal of island effects, resolution of inhomogeneities, etc.  In addition, the project provides funding for a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Data from approximately 100 NEXRAD radars will be composited onto a three-dimensional regional grid with high spatial and temporal resolution.  Climatology of the physical characteristics of overshooting convection, such as vertical extent, geographic distribution, interannual variability, and annual and diurnal cycles will be computed from the radar observations.

Nocturnal rainfall is critical to the hydrology and agriculture of this region, and nocturnal mesoscale organized convection is often accompanied by severe weather. However, a conceptual framework describing how nocturnal convection initiates and evolves at night is still lacking, and the prediction of nocturnal convection still remains a scientific and technical challenge. To improve both our understanding of and our ability to forecast nocturnal convection, the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) field experiment is planned to occur across portions of Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska from June 1 to 15 July 2015. PECAN promises to collect unprecedented observations that capture the multi-scale aspects of nocturnal convection. Such data will not only advance the understanding of key processes associated with nocturnal convection through observational analysis , but also will enable investigators to use advanced data assimilation (DA) and ensemble modeling systems to significantly advance both the understanding and prediction of nocturnal convective systems. This research focuses on the prediction component of PECAN, but also makes major contributions to the other three components of PECAN. Specifically, this research seeks funding to : 1) Support the dry run and field-phase of PECAN through generation of real-time convection-permitting ensemble forecasts initialized using an advanced ensemble based DA and ensemble forecast system; 2) Assimilate special PECAN observations including ground-based remote sensing and compare these simulations against the real-time simulations and the observations to assess the role that the unique PECAN observations play in improving predictive skill; 3) Comprehensively diagnose the ensemble analyses and simulations to determine the dynamical and physical processes that initiate and maintain nocturnal convection and control their structure and evolution; 4) Comprehensively evaluate ensemble analyses and forecasts against special PECAN observations to determine the appropriate modeling strategies (e.g., grid spacing; physical parameterization) for improved prediction.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>This effort will advance our knowledge of the processes that control the initiation, maintenance, evolution and structure of elevated nocturnal convective systems. These goals will be accomplished through a focus on the next generation of convection-permitting models and advanced DA techniques. The simulations under this project will play an important role in bridging between efforts of other PECAN investigators focused on observational analysis of PECAN data and on idealized modeling. This effort will also address the inherent role that bores and stable layer disturbances play in the maintenance of elevated nocturnal systems through analysis of simulations and comparison against observations. Ensemble diagnostics will allow for a novel assessment of the capability of a convection-permitting model simulation to reproduce these key processes. The research findings will provide new insights into advancing DA strategies, model physics and observing strategies of high impact convective weather events.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>This research will address one of the most important goals of weather research - to improve our ability to accurately predict intense hazardous weather that causes large monetary loss, injuries and fatalities. It will directly address three established national priorities in weather: Warn on Forecast for High Impact Weather, the Next-Generation Forecast System, as key component of the Next-Generation Air Transportation System, and Observing Weather and Climate from the Ground Up: A Nationwide Network of Networks. It will provide much needed education and training in the areas of advanced DA and high-resolution ensemble modeling and numerical prediction and expose the next generation of modeling and DA experts to a major scientific field experiment. The research findings have a direct path to operations because the ensemble DA system to be used is developed based on the new US operational DA system, and because of the significant roles of the PIs in and/or linkage of the PIs have made with NOAA National Severe Storm Lab (NSSL), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)."

This study will combine more than 10 year data of ground-based radar observations with numerical model simulations to study the physical and chemical characteristics of overshooting convection.  Data from approximately 100 NEXRAD radars will be composited onto a three-dimensional regional grid with high spatial and temporal resolution.  Climatology of the physical characteristics of overshooting convection, such as vertical extent, geographic distribution, interannual variability, and annual and diurnal cycles will be computed from the radar observations.  Overshooting convection characteristics derived from the composited radar data will be compared with estimates based on satellite IR observations.  To investigate the mechanisms responsible for cross-tropopause transport and to make quantitative estimates of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, numerical model simulations with explicitly resolved convection and chemistry will be carried out for case studies and for an entire warm season.  The radar data will be used along with in situ trace gas observations from aircraft to evaluate the performance of the numerical simulations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>It is well known that convection in the extratropics can penetrate the tropopause and extend into the lower stratosphere, but there is little quantitative information about its geographic distribution, frequency of occurrence, or depth of penetration into the stratosphere.  The radar analyses in this study will lead to a new regional climatology of overshooting convection in the midlatitudes based on direct geometric observations at high spatial and temporal resolution.  The results will be compared with satellite IR estimates of overshooting, which offer the potential to extend the regional results to a global domain. High-resolution numerical simulations of overshooting convection will be used to investigate stratosphere-troposphere exchange mechanisms and to make quantitative estimates of the transport of important trace species.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This research will produce a long-term, public, dataset of radar reflectivity over a large portion of the contiguous U.S.  These data will be applicable to a wide range of other hydrometeorological problems.  Since convection is not resolved in current global climate models, these studies will provide guidance for developing parameterizations of stratosphere-troposphere exchange due to overshooting convection.  A better understanding of overshooting convection will help to reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, which is an important economic and social problem.  In addition, diagnosing convective behavior and its impact on atmospheric chemistry will lead to an improved understanding of processes affecting air quality and human health, as both increases in tropospheric ozone and depletion of stratospheric ozone are possible in overshooting storms."

This effort continues facility operations and community support from the past five years, focused on assisting the research community by 1. directing use of state-of-the-art facilities in unique parts of the world, 2. providing access to a staff of scientists and engineers for consultation and collaboration, 3. providing logistics support for campaigns and long-term measurement programs, 4. providing easy access to various levels of processed and analyzed radar data, and 5. participating in the training of students and assisting student advisors. Knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and geospace environment has advanced significantly during the second half of the twentieth century due in large part to the use of incoherent scatter radars (ISRs). A detailed understanding of even the most basic processes remains somewhat vague, however, because such an understanding must encompass the strongly coupled systems of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and the solar wind. At times, important temporal scales can range from seconds through days. Similarly, the relevant spatial scales range from sub-meters to thousands of kilometers. The AMISR radars have significant scientific advantages over existing ISRs, largely due to the rapid steering provided by the phased array antenna. This pulse-to-pulse steering capability can be exploited to resolve many of the temporal/spatial ambiguities inherent in measurements from mechanically steered dish-based systems. A phased array system enables the short timescale, three-dimensional imaging of ionospheric structures and the tracking of their evolution. Perhaps even greater scientific impact is realized by the ability of the AMISR systems to operate unattended and for some systems on a 24/7 basis. The AMISR facility is remotely accessible, and the ISR and ancillary instruments have been designed to produce processed data that can be made publicly available and distributed to the user community over the internet. The provision of user-friendly data and display capabilities, which meet the community's research needs, is an important part of AMISR operations. Support of a strong, distributed, and trained user community is very important to the overall scientific success of the AMISR project. The AMISR management team will work directly with the students and student advisors from a number of universities to assist with training, experiment planning, and scheduling. The team will also maintain a repository for contributed course materials, technical data, and facility instrument information."

Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technological assets that can be directly damaged by these, so-called, Space Weather events.  Consequently, predicting the occurrence of such events is of critical importance to minimizing their damage. Also, little is known on how the cradle of Space Weather, the solar atmosphere, is formed and maintained. For example, the mechanisms that heat the atmosphere of the Sun to multi-million degree temperatures are not known, and how the continuous outward stream of highly ionized plasma known as the solar wind is heated and accelerated is also still an open question.   This project is a four-year effort to perform an upgrade to an existing corona instrument installed at the solar observatory at Mauna Loa to increase both the field of view of the solar atmosphere that can be imaged and the range of the spectrum that it can observe.   The new measurements will open a new window in the observations of CMEs, allowing for the first time quantitative studies of their thermal structure, dynamics and evolution for the first time.  In addition, they will help deliver the continuous, long-term measurements of plasma dynamics, magnetism and thermodynamics of the entire solar atmosphere that are needed to answer fundamental questions about the heating of the atmosphere and the origin of the solar wind. <br/><br/>The project will be carried out in collaboration between the University of Michigan and the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, each contributing essential expertise and experience to ensure its successful completion.  An important expected outcome of the effort is the creation of an integrated facility that will connect groundbreaking new observations of the solar atmosphere and solar magnetic field with cutting-edge theoretical and diagnostic tools, all of which will be made easily and readily available to the solar and space physics research community.   Undergraduate students will be integrated into the project on yearlong research projects, through the University of Michigan?s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at no cost to this project. Likewise, while not funded in this project, plans are included for graduate students at the University of Michigan to use these new data and modeling tools for their dissertations.<br/><br/>The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP), a visible light coronagraph and filter polarimeter currently deployed at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory which already routinely measures the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters between 1.05 and 1.38 solar radii, will be upgraded to include multiple chromospheric, transition region and coronal lines.  Specifically, the Upgraded CoMP (UCoMP) instrument will extend the wavelength coverage and the number of wavelengths observed by CoMP to include visible and near-IR emission lines in the 5000-11000  range.  The lines that UCoMP will observe are emitted by the quiescent and active corona in the 0.8-4.0 MK temperature range, as well as by the core of accelerating CMEs between 0.01 MK up to &#8776;0.5 MK.   In addition, a new set of dual detectors will enable UCoMP to have nearly twice the FOV and twice the spatial resolution as compared to the existing CoMP capability. <br/>As and integral part of this effort, a joint data distribution and analysis center will be built at HAO and the University of Michigan that will distribute to the space physics community not only the data from UCoMP but also the necessary advanced tools for spectroscopic diagnostics, data analysis, and modeling."

These precipitation types differ in important ways including their predictability and their sensitivity to changes in regional climate, thus an understanding of their behavior and relative contributions to mean precipitation and precipitation change over the SE US is desirable. The PIs have developed a simple characterization of precipitating cloud systems into mesoscale precipitation features (MPFs), which consist of a contiguous region of precipitation of at least 100 km length, and smaller and shorter-lived isolated precipitation features (IPFs). Despite the simplicity of the classification scheme, it has proven effective for understanding the geographical and temporal behavior of SE US precipitation. <br/><br/>A key result of the PIs' previous research is that while MPFs (which include frontal precipitation and mesoscale convective systems) do not exhibit a strong seasonal cycle, the seasonal cycle of IPFs is characterized by a relatively abrupt spring onset occurring between May and June and concentrated over Florida, the adjacent coastline of the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Hatteras. The onset of IPF rainfall over the SE US is somewhat reminiscent of the abrupt transition to the rainy season in monsoon regions such as West Africa and East Asia, which have been more extensively studied than the SE US. <br/><br/>Work conducted here explores the springtime IPF onset using a combination of observational data and numerical model simulations. Observational data come from the National Mosaic and Multi-sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (NMQ) dataset, a precipitation dataset constructed from the NEXRAD network of radar stations that covers nearly all of the continental US. The PIs have developed an automated precipitation organization classification algorithm to identify MPFs and IPFs, and they apply the algorithm to 11 years (2002-2012) of NMQ data on an hourly basis to capture statistics of the spring IPF onset. These data will be used in conjunction with the North American Regional Reanalysis to assess contributions to the onset from thermodynamic factors such as convective available potential energy and convective inhibition, and circulation changes such as the seasonal movement of the North American subtropical high (NASH) and low-level jets in the region. <br/><br/>A further goal is to understand how IPF seasonality may change in a changing climate. The PIs hypothesize that the IPF onset should occur earlier in a warmer climate, as the relevant thermodynamic conditions would likely occur earlier in the year. Research on IPF sensitivity to background warming is conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is used to simulate weather and climate over a regional domain given meteorological conditions at the boundaries. The simulations use the pseudo global warming (PGW) method, in which meteorological conditions are taken from operational meteorological analysis to simulate the seasonal transition in recent years of record, and simulations are then repeated using boundary conditions to which differences between future and present-day climate simulations are added to represent anticipated climate change. <br/><br/>The seasonal transition of precipitation types over the SE US is of interest for practical as well as scientific reasons, as decision makers rely on weather and climate forecasts for agricultural planning as well as guidance on precipitation-related hazards and urban development. The PIs engage with local communities from Raleigh to the Outer Banks through venues including presentations at public libraries. Results of the project are used in courses taught by the PIs, in part through a WRF-based teaching laboratory for weather forecasting, which serves an educational purpose and also enhances the success of students pursuing careers in weather prediction."

This effort continues facility operations and community support from the past five years, focused on assisting the research community by 1. directing use of state-of-the-art facilities in unique parts of the world, 2. providing access to a staff of scientists and engineers for consultation and collaboration, 3. providing logistics support for campaigns and long-term measurement programs, 4. providing easy access to various levels of processed and analyzed radar data, and 5. participating in the training of students and assisting student advisors. Knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and geospace environment has advanced significantly during the second half of the twentieth century due in large part to the use of incoherent scatter radars (ISRs). A detailed understanding of even the most basic processes remains somewhat vague, however, because such an understanding must encompass the strongly coupled systems of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and the solar wind. At times, important temporal scales can range from seconds through days. Similarly, the relevant spatial scales range from sub-meters to thousands of kilometers. The AMISR radars have significant scientific advantages over existing ISRs, largely due to the rapid steering provided by the phased array antenna. This pulse-to-pulse steering capability can be exploited to resolve many of the temporal/spatial ambiguities inherent in measurements from mechanically steered dish-based systems. A phased array system enables the short timescale, three-dimensional imaging of ionospheric structures and the tracking of their evolution. Perhaps even greater scientific impact is realized by the ability of the AMISR systems to operate unattended and for some systems on a 24/7 basis. The AMISR facility is remotely accessible, and the ISR and ancillary instruments have been designed to produce processed data that can be made publicly available and distributed to the user community over the internet. The provision of user-friendly data and display capabilities, which meet the community's research needs, is an important part of AMISR operations. Support of a strong, distributed, and trained user community is very important to the overall scientific success of the AMISR project. The AMISR management team will work directly with the students and student advisors from a number of universities to assist with training, experiment planning, and scheduling. The team will also maintain a repository for contributed course materials, technical data, and facility instrument information."

Radar meteorologists have used a variety of methods to estimate vertical winds from radar data, but there is room for improvement.

A field experiment called the Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) was launched in 2011 in aiming to advance understanding of the MJO by collecting in situ observations over the central Indian Ocean where the MJO forms most often. DYNAMO deployed radiosondes, Doppler radars, oceanographic instrumentation, research aircraft and other sensors to study the spectrum of convection and ocean interactions associated with the MJO. This research project will use Doppler radar data and soundings from the DYNAMO field experiment over the Central Indian Ocean along with satellite observations, to elucidate the mesoscale flow structure and dynamical evolution associated with the MJO. The funded project will utilize the extensive Doppler radar and atmospheric sounding network data from DYNAMO to study how precipitating clouds organize as a function of the environment. A related effort will be directed towards synthesizing the data from the four DYNAMO Doppler radars to provide a comprehensive validation dataset for numerical modeling activities targeted at MJO prediction. The PI will also investigate how MJO precipitation and clouds change across the diurnal cycle, and how the diurnal cycle of precipitation interacts with the MJO. The third task of this research is to investigate physical processes associated with how shallow clouds transition to deep clouds during the initiation stage of the MJO. Long term satellite and reanalysis data will be used to determine the underlying large-scale and physical mechanisms responsible for specific mode of the transition such as gradual versus rapid transition. <br/><br/>This research will contribute to the knowledge base regarding initiation of the MJO, which at present has major uncertainties. Significant efforts are being directed towards identifying the physics of MJO initiation based on numerical model simulations. The research project will develop a statistical database regarding organization, structure, and the diurnal cycle of MJO precipitating clouds spanning the MJO initiation, mature and dissipating stages. This dataset will provide a robust means for validating precipitation and clouds simulated by numerical models targeted at MJO. Carrying out research on the structure, organization, diurnal cycle, and transition of MJO precipitating clouds will provide a more physically based understanding of the MJO that ultimately should improve numerical model simulations of MJO initiation and propagation. Such knowledge and gained prediction skill may also improve understanding of the worldwide impacts of the MJO and eventually lead to better short and long term forecasts of global weather patterns."

S-PolKa was uniquely capable of achieving this goal because of: (1) its ability to see not only the precipitating convection but also the nonprecipitating clouds; and (2) its dual-polarization technology that allowed determination of the microphysical as well as kinematic and precipitation structure of the precipitating convection. Working in concert with other radars, S-PolKa provided a wealth of information on the convective cloud evolution in the MJO, and this project determines the organization and structure of the cloud population at all of its stages of the MJO through analysis of the S-PolKa data and comparison with model output. The high sensitivity of the S-band S-PolKa radar provided observations of nonprecipitating clouds. In highly suppressed conditions, the MJO cloud population occurs initially in lines of small cumulus. When some of these clouds precipitate, the showers form cold pools, which take over the boundary layer structure. The cold pools trigger more and larger convection until the deep precipitating convection begins to dominate. The nonprecipitating clouds are seen by S-PolKa because they produce Bragg scattering, with identifiable dual-polarization signatures. Analysis of the S-PolKa scans will document the organization and evolution of the clouds into lines and cold pool patterns. A co-located vertically pointing Ka-band radar (the DOE KAZR) will add vertical structure information. The empirical characteristics of the shallow clouds will be compared to fine resolution numerical model output. S-PolKa?s dual-polarization data indicates the dominant microphysical characteristics of deeper convection and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Two types of MCSs occurred: squall-lines with trailing stratiform precipitation and non-squall systems in which stratiform precipitation formed from the dying of convective cells. The microphysical and kinematic structures of both types of MCS will be determined from S-PolKa. A nearly co-located C-band Doppler radar (SMART-R)will provide additional kinematic information. Comparison with regional model output will give insight into how the MCSs developed and how they were affected by wind shear and other environmental factors. Comparison of the DYNAMO observations with other NSF deployments (TiMREX and NAME) will indicate how the equatorial convection differs from MCSs in the subtropics near and over land and complex terrain.<br/><br/>The characteristics of shallow, deep, and mesoscale convective elements derived from S-PolKa and the other radars will facilitate understanding of the contributions of the individual components to the aggregated cloud ensemble of the MJO. It is also important to understand how the composition of the cloud population evolves. The DYNAMO S-PolKa data shows that the MJO cloud population development is multiscale. The convectively active period of an MJO lasts from 1-4 weeks. Within this period the convection is controlled by intermediate-scale equatorial waves, which concentrate the convective population into shorter 2-4 day periods in which the convective population goes through a similar cycle of growth and decline. This intermediate scale is important, lying between cloud scale and MJO scale. To study this intermediate-scale behavior, the S-PolKa data will be examined in light of Indian Ocean basin-wide simulations of the multiscale behavior of the MJO.<br/><br/>A primary goal of DYNAMO was to determine the details of the evolution of the cloud population of the MJO as it develops over the Indian Ocean. This project will be a major contribution toward the achievement of that aim.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The MJO affects weather globally, from variations in the Asian monsoon to variations in winter weather over the U.S. The physical understanding provided by this project's analysis of the S-PolKa dataset underpins the development of better models to forecast the MJO. In addition, the project contributes to the training of women scientists."

Complex morphological structures in their brightness distribution provide observable consequences of the deposition of energy and momentum by atmospheric gravity waves (GW) in the MLT. This high-resolution data set of optical images provides a unique window into the poorly understood instability and turbulent dynamics on the smallest scales (between roughly a meter and a few km).

Researchers do not yet fully understand exactly what physical mechanisms cause the first sparks of a lightning flash and how those sparks transform the non-conducting air into the highly conductive lightning channel.  This study will analyze several months of lightning data to gain new understanding of initiation processes.  This project combines an unusual suite of traditional and state-of-the-art research sensors to advance the understanding of lightning initiation.  This research has strong societal impact through potentially improved understanding of lighting initiation and improved lightning warning systems.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to analyze lightning data collected in northern Mississippi during summer 2016 to study cloud discharge events that lead to lightning initiation.  Those events include fast positive breakdown, narrow bipolar events (NBEs), initial electric field changes (IECs), and initial breakdown pulses (IBPs).  The novelty, and potentially transformative aspect of this new research, is in the new data, which includes measurements from an electric field derivative sensor and a very high frequency (VHF) sensor.  The VHF sensor is particularly suitable for studying the lightning initiating events, because although not well understood, electrical discharges in air are known to produce HF and VHF radiation. The analysis will take into consideration the recent discovery of fast positive breakdown and will investigate how fast positive breakdown is connected to the events that follow.  A similar line of research will be conducted to study how VHF pulses affect IECs or IBPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity. The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>This project is a component of the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South. <br/><br/>Work supported here uses data collected in the SOCRATES campaign to improve the representation of SO clouds and cloud-aerosol interactions in climate and weather models. Several possible reasons for the cloud deficiencies are addressed, including deficiencies in the representation of cloud microphysics leading to overly rapid freezing of supercooled liquid water (SLW) cloud droplets, excessive precipitation from shallow cumulus clouds, errors in the representation of small-scale turbulent motions and their effects on the distribution of condensed water in clouds, and inaccurate representation of aerosols and their ability to serve as condensation nuclei for liquid cloud droplets and nucleating particles for cloud ice.  Much of the activity in the campaign is focused on the abundance of SLW in SO clouds, which are less glaciated (i.e. they contain more very cold liquid droplets and fewer ice particles) than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts, and work in this project uses model simulations to understand this difference.<br/><br/>Two categories of models are used, global atmospheric models and large-eddy simulation (LES) models.  Global models include the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), developed by and for the research community and hosted at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Atmospheric Model version 4 (AM4), developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.  The LES model is the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), developed by researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Colorado State University.  For the global models, a ""nudged meteorology"" strategy is used to facilitate comparisons between observations and model simulations.  In this strategy the model is subjected to forcing terms which constrain it to remain close wind and temperature values produced by operational weather forecasting centers.  The goal is to reproduce the large-scale meteorological conditions in which campaign observations were made, so that the cloud and aerosol observations from the campaign can be reasonably compared to their simulated counterparts.  The PIs intend to use the understanding developed from these comparisons, and from the LES modeling, to develop a representation for ice nucleating particles in CAM6. <br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to its potential value for improving models used for weather prediction and future climate projections.  The work on model improvement also has broader impacts for the scientific research community, as CAM6 and AM4 are widely used tools for scientific research.  The nudged meteorology simulations are available for community use as part of the long-term online archive of data collected in the campaign, along with the meteorological analyses used to nudge the models and ancillary cloud and sea surface observations from satellites.  While the SO is a remote region, it can play an important role in understanding the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud behavior, as the unpolluted conditions there allow an assessment of what clouds, aerosols, and their interactions would look like in the absence of aerosols from industry, agriculture, and other human activities. In addition to the broader impacts of the work performed, the project provides support and training for two postdocs, thereby providing for the development of the scientific work force in this research area.  The PIs also contribute to campaign outreach activities including a SOCRATES blog."

All of these hydroclimate extremes exhibited noticeable seasonal variability, suggesting that the seasonality is an important component of variability and forcing behind drought and wetness regimes. There is robust evidence from paleoclimate records that the U.S. was struck by more intense, long lasting, and widespread drought and wet episodes during the last two thousand years.  However, many of the available proxy records cannot resolve the seasonality of droughts and pluvials. Therefore, the discrete seasonality of hydroclimate variations needs to be specified in proxy reconstructions to the extent possible to provide the most realistic estimation of past climate.  <br/><br/>The research outlined in this project is a plan to estimate discrete cool and warm season surface moisture and associated atmospheric states on an annual basis over North America during the last millennium using an offline data assimilation approach. These new estimations will then be used to understand the atmospheric circulation and large-scale forcing of cool and warm season droughts and pluvials on interannual, decadal, and centennial time scales.<br/><br/>The research will reconstruct gridded cool and warm season moisture and three dimensional atmospheric states across North America during the last millennium using paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) techniques. The explicit seasonal reconstructions will be based on the North American Seasonal Drought Atlas (NASDA) and a subset of existing annual tree ring chronologies with restricted seasonal climate responses. The paleoclimate data assimilation uses dynamical models to infer spatial relationships within and between climate fields. Therefore, the estimated seasonal moisture and atmospheric states are physically and dynamically consistent. The cool and warm season moisture and atmospheric states will all be exactly dated and annually resolved. The new reconstructions will provide an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the cross-season coherency and casual mechanisms of major drought and pluvial events during the last millennium. This project will examine whether the physical processes that initiated, sustained and/or diminished past droughts or pluvials in North America could vary at different time scales. <br/><br/>Specifically, the new reconstructions will be used to test hypotheses concerning: 1) the ocean-atmospheric forcing of cool and warm season hydroclimate over North America, 2) the climate dynamics responsible for persistent droughts and pluvials on seasonal basis, 3) the linkages between cool and warm season hydroclimate variability, and 4) the causal mechanisms for individual hydroclimate extremes.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include the development of an online and interactive atlas of cool and warm season moisture and atmospheric states for each year over the past millennium.  This atlas will include maps of cool and warm season moisture, sea level pressure, 500hPa geopotential height and other key variables.   Users from academic communities and the general public will be able to access the detailed seasonal atmospheric information for any particular year or group of years. The seasonal reconstructions will also provide an objective framework to evaluate the impacts of hydroclimate extremes on social and ecological changes during the prehistoric, colonial, and modern eras.   The researchers will collaborate with the Arkansas State Climate Office to promote the awareness of potential water issues associated with droughts and pluvials.

Rey Marcos cave has yielded proof-of-concept data that allows for high-precision Uranium-series ages resulting from ideal geochemical characteristics and equilibrium isotopic values.  Preliminary data from a stalagmite spanning the last 15,000 years shows that the Central American monsoon strengthened at approximately 9,200 years ago coincident with increased Caribbean Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and land surface temperatures in Guatemala.  A strong and stable monsoon characterizes the rest of the Holocene in contrast to the monsoon weakening over the Holocene arising from decreasing insolation inferred from the Cariaco Basin.  The researchers hypothesize that the dominant forcing on the Central American monsoon is SST change and that orbital insolation is a secondary and less important forcing.<br/><br/>The project will enable a new test of the SST versus orbital forcing hypotheses on orbital timescales.  Further, the work will document the timing and duration of past climate events like the current and last interglacials, the influence of millennial-scale variability arising from Heinrich stadials, changes in the meridional overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, and high-to-low latitude manifestations of Dansgaard/Oeschger events. <br/><br/>The proof of concept data differ from other regional records which have documented links to orbital and North Atlantic sourced millennial variability, such as speleothem records of the Mesoamerican monsoon from Mexico and marine sediments from the Cariaco Basin.

Knowledge of H is important for mesospheric and lower thermospheric heating, and for plasmaspheric and magnetospheric charging following geomagnetic storms. As the lightest neutral species in the atmosphere, H requires the lowest energy to overcome the Earth's gravitational force and escape into interplanetary space. Permanent loss of H has a significant impact on long-term atmospheric evolution.<br/><br/>Numerical models of exospheric H assume a population of collisional atoms. However, this assumption has long been known to be oversimplified. Recent measurements made by the PIs of non-thermal, high-energy H atoms in the upper thermosphere bear this out. The goals of this proposal are to refine the PI's radiative transfer models to reflect non-collisional H physics, and to identify the mechanisms that control the distribution and dynamical transport of H atoms in the terrestrial thermosphere and exosphere. The efforts will lead to further understanding of the structure, chemical coupling and energetics of the space-atmosphere interaction region. The work also sheds light on the evolution of the exosphere due to H escape. The new modeling capabilities and inversion techniques can be easily generalized for the study of other planetary atmospheres, particularly that of Mars.

It is anticipated that improved understanding of the MJO through this project will contribute to improvements in weather and climate forecasts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to train a post-doctoral candidate in scale interactions, tropical meteorology and high performance computing.

The research funded by this award would analyze the absorption data collected over the past 25 years by a network of 13 riometers located distributed across central Canada with a typical spatial separation of 500 to 2000 km between adjacent sites.  These instruments operate at 30 MHz and measure at multiple locations the signal absorption of extraterrestrial cosmic noise radiowave caused by electron production in the altitude range of 75 to 115 km (upper D- and lower E-regions).  Two sources of electron production exist in this height range: 1) photoionization and 2) impact-ionization associated with the precipitation of ions and electrons of magnetospheric origin.  The loss of the radiowave power received above the Earth's surface at any one time relative to a Quiet Day Curve (which is associated with photo-ionization) is a measure of the absorption to be associated with the precipitation of particles into this ionized region. Calibration of the riometer absorption measurements would be achieved by using measured fluxes of precipitating electrons and measured populations of trapped electrons observed in the radiation belts. This calibration would be based upon the magnetosphere detector measurements derived from tracing the positions of satellite particle energy detectors onboard the Van Allen Probes and the five THEMIS satellites using a sophisticated field-line model of the Earth's magnetic field distribution to determine the magnetospheric footprints of these satellites in situ measurements at various spatial locations across central Canada.  The process of selection of riometer absorption data for this calibration process would extract those absorption values associated with the coincidence of the footprint positions with the riometer field of view. The riometer absorption data collected would be analyzed in a statistical sense to establish possible causal relationships between the absorption signature regarding size and shape of absorption and the particular energy band responsible for the particle precipitation into the 90 km region for each riometer site. One relationship that would be searched for in this research is the development of a possible proxy for the extent of magnetospheric wave activity causing the particle precipitation. Another relationship would be the determination from the observed absorption the fractional loss of energetic electrons in the range of tens of keV to MeV energies to the upper atmosphere.  A broader impact of this award would be the enhancement of a riometer network as a useful tool with a strong potential for successful application in terrestrial and space weather forecasting. <br/><br/>Comparing riometer absorption with satellite measurements of precipitating electrons will provide for the development statistically of a relationship relating the size and shape of riometer absorption signatures with the energy spectrum of the precipitating particles.  The absorption signature results for the different riometers within the network would be used to develop maps of latitudinal and magnetic local time (MLT) distributions of precipitation. Comparison of these signatures with trapped population measurements will quantify the importance of the electron energy loss to the atmosphere, which will help understand the role of energetic electron precipitation in the global system. This study would be coincident with the declining phase of the current solar cycle and will help to demonstrate how low-cost remote sensing of ionospheric precipitation can help understand processes that directly affect the terrestrial and space weather climate."

Furthermore, because of society's increasing reliance on technology that is susceptible to changing conditions in space, knowledge of the space climate and predictive understanding of the next Solar Cycle are crucial.  The main purpose of this five-year project is to enable continued accurate measurements of the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun during the transition from Solar Cycle 24 to Solar Cycle 25 using the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) instrument.  Observing this transition in the solar activity is particularly important, because solar physicists were unable to predict many of the unusual characteristics of Solar Cycle 24: its delayed start, historically weak level of activity, diminished solar wind strength, increased cosmic-ray intensity, and strong north-south asymmetry.  Consequently, extending WSO's consistent 43-year time-series of measurements into the next Solar Cycle is critical for understanding the long-term magnetic activity cycle of the Sun and other Sun-like stars.  <br/><br/>During this five-year project, the team at Stanford University will: (i) collect, process, and evaluate the WSO observations of the Sun's photosphere; (ii) extend the reliable, consistent, nearly four-solar-cycle-long time-series of useful data products; and, (iii) make the data even more conveniently available to the broad scientific community.  Furthermore, the WSO will continue to contribute to STEM education in the U.S., work force development, and public outreach.  Observations at the WSO are collected by a resident observer, who is a graduate student in solar physics at Stanford University.  Numerous summer students contribute to the data analysis and software development at the Observatory.  Improved Solar Cycle predictions are crucial for advancing the national Space Weather efforts, and improved understanding of the Solar Cycle is relevant to advancing knowledge on the activity cycles on other Sun-like stars, which can affect our assessment of exoplanet habitability.

All of these hydroclimate extremes exhibited noticeable seasonal variability, suggesting that the seasonality is an important component of variability and forcing behind drought and wetness regimes. There is robust evidence from paleoclimate records that the U.S. was struck by more intense, long lasting, and widespread drought and wet episodes during the last two thousand years.  However, many of the available proxy records cannot resolve the seasonality of droughts and pluvials. Therefore, the discrete seasonality of hydroclimate variations needs to be specified in proxy reconstructions to the extent possible to provide the most realistic estimation of past climate.  <br/><br/>The research outlined in this project is a plan to estimate discrete cool and warm season surface moisture and associated atmospheric states on an annual basis over North America during the last millennium using an offline data assimilation approach. These new estimations will then be used to understand the atmospheric circulation and large-scale forcing of cool and warm season droughts and pluvials on interannual, decadal, and centennial time scales.<br/><br/>The research will reconstruct gridded cool and warm season moisture and three dimensional atmospheric states across North America during the last millennium using paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) techniques. The explicit seasonal reconstructions will be based on the North American Seasonal Drought Atlas (NASDA) and a subset of existing annual tree ring chronologies with restricted seasonal climate responses. The paleoclimate data assimilation uses dynamical models to infer spatial relationships within and between climate fields. Therefore, the estimated seasonal moisture and atmospheric states are physically and dynamically consistent. The cool and warm season moisture and atmospheric states will all be exactly dated and annually resolved. The new reconstructions will provide an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the cross-season coherency and casual mechanisms of major drought and pluvial events during the last millennium. This project will examine whether the physical processes that initiated, sustained and/or diminished past droughts or pluvials in North America could vary at different time scales. <br/><br/>Specifically, the new reconstructions will be used to test hypotheses concerning: 1) the ocean-atmospheric forcing of cool and warm season hydroclimate over North America, 2) the climate dynamics responsible for persistent droughts and pluvials on seasonal basis, 3) the linkages between cool and warm season hydroclimate variability, and 4) the causal mechanisms for individual hydroclimate extremes.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include the development of an online and interactive atlas of cool and warm season moisture and atmospheric states for each year over the past millennium.  This atlas will include maps of cool and warm season moisture, sea level pressure, 500hPa geopotential height and other key variables.   Users from academic communities and the general public will be able to access the detailed seasonal atmospheric information for any particular year or group of years. The seasonal reconstructions will also provide an objective framework to evaluate the impacts of hydroclimate extremes on social and ecological changes during the prehistoric, colonial, and modern eras.   The researchers will collaborate with the Arkansas State Climate Office to promote the awareness of potential water issues associated with droughts and pluvials.

This project brings together height-resolved measurements of ionization in the ionosphere, in situ measurements of pitch-angle scattering in the inner magnetosphere, and multidisciplinary expertise to achieve closure for all wave modes that may be involved in electron precipitation mechanisms. Instances of temporally coincident Van Allen Probes' measurements of particles and waves in the radiation belt (or ring current) and Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) measurements of particles precipitating into the ionosphere near the foot-point of the Van Allen Probes' flux tubes will be identified. The loss-cone distribution functions created by candidate waves for pitch-angle scattering using the quasi-linear diffusion equations will be calculated.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity. The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>This project is a component of the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV is based in Hobart, Australia and makes multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South. <br/><br/>Work supported here uses data collected in the SOCRATES campaign to improve the representation of SO clouds and cloud-aerosol interactions in climate and weather models. Several possible reasons for the cloud deficiencies are addressed, including deficiencies in the representation of cloud microphysics leading to overly rapid freezing of supercooled liquid water (SLW) cloud droplets, excessive precipitation from shallow cumulus clouds, errors in the representation of small-scale turbulent motions and their effects on the distribution of cloud water, and inaccurate representation of aerosols and their role as condensation nuclei for liquid droplets and nucleating particles for cloud ice.  Much of the activity in the campaign is focused on the abundance of SLW in SO clouds, which are less glaciated than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (i.e. they contain more very cold liquid droplets and fewer ice particles), and work in this project uses model simulations to understand this difference.<br/><br/>Two categories of models are used, global atmospheric models and large-eddy simulation (LES) models.  Global models include the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), developed by and for the research community and hosted at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the Atmospheric Model version 4 (AM4), developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.  The LES model is the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), developed by researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Colorado State University.  For the global models, a ""nudged meteorology"" strategy is used to facilitate comparisons between observations and model simulations.  In this strategy the model is subjected to forcing terms which constrain it to remain close wind and temperature values produced by operational weather forecasting centers.  The goal is to reproduce the large-scale meteorological conditions in which campaign observations were made, so that the cloud and aerosol observations from the campaign can be reasonably compared to their simulated counterparts.  The project uses the understanding developed from these comparisons, and from the LES modeling, to develop a representation for ice nucleating particles in CAM6. <br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to its potential value for improving models used for weather prediction and future climate projections.  The work on model improvement also has broader impacts for the scientific research community, as CAM6 and AM4 are widely used tools for scientific research.  The nudged meteorology simulations are available for community use as part of the long-term online archive of data collected in the campaign, along with the meteorological analyses used to nudge the models and ancillary cloud and sea surface observations from satellites. In addition to the broader impacts of the work performed, the project provides support and training for two postdocs, thereby providing for the development of the scientific workforce in this research area.  The PIs also contribute to campaign outreach activities including a SOCRATES blog."

Previous studies on the extratropical impact on the tropics have remained largely qualitative in nature and from the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere perspective. As such, the impact of extratropical climate on tropical climate has remained largely unexplored. The goal of this project is to investigate the extratropical impact on tropical climate with the focus on quantifying extratropical influences of tropical climate and its variability. The project will use a novel modeling approach called Regional Coupled Data Assimilation (RCDA) approach, which combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics, to assess and understand the extratropical climate impact on tropical climate for the real world. In RCDA, observations in the extratropics are assimilated in climate models while the tropical ocean-atmosphere processes remain fully coupled. This allows the quantitative assessment and understanding of the extratropical impacts on both tropical climatology and tropical climate variability, such as ENSO. The research team will also explore the extratropical impact on the tropical bias in coupled general circulation models. <br/><br/>The funded research represents a systematic study of the extratropical impact on tropical climate and tropical climate variability that combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics. This work will develop a new modeling strategy to assess and understand the impact of extratropical climate variability on tropical climatology and climate variability. This understanding will help further improve climate models for climate predictions, future climate projections, and, in turn, their societal impacts. This project will train two graduate students."

Rey Marcos cave has yielded proof-of-concept data that allows for high-precision Uranium-series ages resulting from ideal geochemical characteristics and equilibrium isotopic values.  Preliminary data from a stalagmite spanning the last 15,000 years shows that the Central American monsoon strengthened at approximately 9,200 years ago coincident with increased Caribbean Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and land surface temperatures in Guatemala.  A strong and stable monsoon characterizes the rest of the Holocene in contrast to the monsoon weakening over the Holocene arising from decreasing insolation inferred from the Cariaco Basin.  The researchers hypothesize that the dominant forcing on the Central American monsoon is SST change and that orbital insolation is a secondary and less important forcing.<br/><br/>The project will enable a new test of the SST versus orbital forcing hypotheses on orbital timescales.  Further, the work will document the timing and duration of past climate events like the current and last interglacials, the influence of millennial-scale variability arising from Heinrich stadials, changes in the meridional overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, and high-to-low latitude manifestations of Dansgaard/Oeschger events. <br/><br/>The proof of concept data differ from other regional records which have documented links to orbital and North Atlantic sourced millennial variability, such as speleothem records of the Mesoamerican monsoon from Mexico and marine sediments from the Cariaco Basin.

The research program seeks to understand how these flows affect larger circulation patterns, particularly the meridional and zonal flow components of global circulation.  The meridional flow is involved critically in the process that leads to Sun's polar field polarity reversals and the ability to predict properties of subsequent solar cycles.  It is not clear how it is modulated in time by the contribution of active-region related inflows.  A quantitative assessment of this contribution, provided by this research project, will allow critical improvements to be made in predictive models.  Theories regarding the physics of the flows have been put forward, with predictions about their variation with depth.  These predictions will be tested by the inverse modeling efforts as part of this project.  Using artificial data available from numerical MHD simulations, the research activities will also aim to develop and validate methods to infer subsurface flows reliably and which avoid artifacts caused by the influence of surface magnetic fields on the seismic waves.  These methods will be invaluable for improving and validating other models of flows and structures inferred through helioseismology.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this 3-year project is to perform a comprehensive, high-spatial-resolution helioseismic survey of subsurface flows around solar magnetic regions in order to improve models of solar dynamo.  The research project has four main objectives. The first objective is to characterize, using helioseismic holography applied to Dopplergrams from the Helioseismic Imager onboard the SDO mission, the near-surface flows observed around solar active regions.  This characterization will include examining the dependence of the flow properties with magnetic flux.  The time dependence of the flows as regions evolve will also be examined.  The second objective is to establish and quantify the contribution of the near-surface flows surrounding active regions to the latitudinal- and temporal-variation of the global meridional and zonal flow patterns.  This will be achieved by comparing monthly time and longitude averages of active-region related flows with meridional and zonal flow measurements.  The third objective is to determine, through helioseismic inverse modeling, the depth dependence of active-region related flows, in order to provide a physical understanding of the flows.  The fourth objective is to validate the reliability of the flow determination around active regions.  This will be achieved using existing synthetic data derived from state-of-the-art numerical MHD simulations of waves in the vicinity of magnetic structures.<br/><br/>An understanding of the contribution of active-region-related flows in Sun's interior to the larger-scale dynamics is required for improving surface-flux-transport models of the solar dynamo.  The outcome of this project is expected to improve general knowledge of solar and stellar dynamos and the evolution of magnetic fields.  The expected results will allow improvements in predicting the solar-cycles of the Sun.  The project team will broadly disseminate data products for their use in these types of models as part of this program.  This project will facilitate continued involvement of the team in the REU Program in Solar and Space Physics hosted by the University of Colorado at Boulder.  A considerable portion of this research is being carried out by a postdoctoral research scientist who will take the lead on several of the project tasks.

The details of how smoke aerosol particles and stratocumulus clouds interact is inadequately understood, despite the disproportionally large role those types of clouds play in local and global climate. This project seeks to improve understanding of how smoke changes the way air circulates near clouds, how cloud droplets in polluted clouds evaporate at different rates from those in pristine clouds, and how drizzle is modified when smoke is present. Stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in water vapor and cloud liquid will be measured from aircraft flights though smoke and cloud layers near Namibia to evaluate characteristics of atmospheric mixing, cloud evaporation and the fraction of clouds droplets which grow to produce rain. These characteristics are difficult to quantify from more traditional methods. Isotopic data will be used to evaluate entrainment and evaporation simulated by the NCAR Community Earth System Model to evaluate where new understanding from the experiment can improve model simulations. <br/><br/>Lack of knowledge about cloud-smoke interactions leads to crude treatment of processes in climate models, which consequently leads important unresolved uncertainties in climate model simulations. The isotopic study provides a sorely needed critical check on how clouds are depicted in models and gives specific guidance as to which mechanisms are incorrectly represented. The datasets collected enable several research groups to test and compare their models using isotopic constraints which will serve as a valuable legacy of the experiment. The data-model synthesis fosters collaboration that bridges between observation and modeling specialists and enables students training in combining expertise in modeling and data methods to achieve enhanced knowledge though synthesis.

These large storm systems produce extreme weather including hail, floods, and tornados, but they also make an important contribution to water resources over the eastern two thirds of the continental US (CONUS) during the growing season.  This project seeks to understand MCS behavior in an aggregate sense, including the long-term contribution of MCS precipitation to the overall water balance of the CONUS and the importance of year-to-year variability in MCS activity for anomalously wet (flood) or dry (drought) conditions.  <br/><br/>A key tool for conducting the research is the  Weather Services International (WSI) National Operational Weather radar (NOWrad) data set, a 20-year record (currently 1996-2015) created from the National Weather Service radar stations which provide continuous near-total coverage of the CONUS. A primary goal of the project is to develop and apply an automated procedure to detect and track MCSs in the radar data.  The algorithm identifies MCSs as contiguous or semi-contiguous features in radar maps over an area of at least 100km along the system's major axis exceeding a threshold reflectivity value.  MCS tracking is complicated by the the tendency of MCSs to split and merge as they propagate, and the algorithm incorporates a method for identifying mergers and splits. A further issue is that large regions of intense precipitation can occur in frontal cyclones and landfalling hurricanes, and a classification scheme is necessary to distinguish these regions from MCSs.  A machine learning technique to perform this classification is developed using expert judgement to train a random forest classifier (RFC) scheme. Further expert judgement is solicited through a survey which invites the research community to participate in the development and validation of the tracking and classification schemes.  The catalog of MCS events and their characteristics (intensity, duration, structure, etc) is then used to study MCS seasonality, interannual variability, and contribution to CONUS rainfall including floods and droughts.<br/><br/>Further work uses a global climate model (GFDL-CM3) in combination with a regional convection permitting model (WRF-ARW at 4km horizontal resolution) to simulate MCSs over the CONUS under present-day and projected future climate conditions.  The simulations are analyzed according to the tracking and classification schemes developed for the NOWrad data, and the model simulations allow examination of how MCS behavior depends on climatic factors such as tropospheric moisture, soil moisture, atmospheric stability, and large-scale atmospheric circulation.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the importance of MCS rainfall as a water resource for agriculture and the severe weather hazards related to MCS activity.  The algorithms and datasets produced for the project will be shared with researchers and operational climatologists and hydrologists through an online portal.  In addition, the project supports and trains a graduate student and provides summer  support for an undergraduate, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this area."

They occur over a broad range of spatial scales but are generally smaller than the frontal weather systems seen on weather maps.  They can be generated by a variety of mechanisms including air flow over mountains, the formation of frontal systems, and the vertical motions that accompany convection.  Despite their relatively small size, they are thought to play an important role in the atmospheric circulation due to their vertical flux of horizontal momentum, through which they drive the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere, modulate the strength of the midlatitude jet streams, and alter the strength of the stratospheric polar vortices, thereby playing a role in the seasonal evolution of the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole.  But the small size of the waves and their relatively rapid propagation make it difficult to observe them and examine their generation, propagation, and impacts on the mean flow. Moreover, the waves cannot generally be simulated by global weather and climate models due to their small size, and instead they must represented through parameterizations which estimate their aggregate effects as a function of the resolved flow.  While these parameterizations have become quite sophisticated, their validity is difficult to establish, and common circulation biases in models are often ascribed to inadequacies of the gravity wave parameterizations.<br/><br/>Work under this award specifically addresses gravity waves generated by convection, motivated by recent observations from balloons and satellites suggesting that that large amplitude gravity waves, of the sort that come from vigorous, small-scale deep convection, account for a larger fraction of the gravity wave momentum flux than previously assumed.  Further motivation comes from the availability of the record of tropical convection from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), a satellite record which is now over a dozen years long and can be used to estimate the generation of gravity waves by tropical and subtropical convection.  The data is used in conjunction with the gravity wave parameterization from the Community Atmosphere Model, along with observational wind and atmospheric stability data, to estimate the generation, propagation, and momentum flux of convectively generated gravity wave activity.  The momentum flux is then compared with estimates calculated from the satellite record of atmospheric temperature from the satellite record of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS).  The goal of this effort is to reconcile the large-scale patterns in gravity wave activity observed in the tropics and subtropics with existing knowledge of their convective sources, based on a theoretical understanding of their propagation and mean flow interaction.  The reconciliation is expected to require some ad hoc adjustment of free parameters in the parameterization scheme, and the PIs will conduct further experiments to determine how this ""tuning"" of the parameterization affects the large-scale atmospheric simulation produced by the model.  Some work will also consider  the generation of gravity waves by convection occurring in the storm tracks of the middle latitudes, using other data sources to estimate convection.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the need for accurate gravity wave parameterizations in weather and climate models. These models are widely used as research tools for a variety of applications, and are also used to provide information to first responders, decision makers, and the general public.  In addition, the project supports and trains a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

The work focuses on the evolution of convection within African easterly waves (AEWs), tropical waves disturbances with wavelengths of 2,000 to 2,500km which originate over West Africa and propagate westward over the northern tropical Atlantic.  AEWs are of particular interest as they play a key role in the formation of tropical storms and hurricanes.  <br/><br/>The work is based on preliminary findings suggesting a chain of meteorological relationships that can lead to the development of heavy rain.  One is that cyclonic vorticity (a measure of the strength of cyclonic rotation or shear in the horizontal circulation) at a mid-tropospheric level (say 600mb) can produce warmer temperatures above and colder temperatures below that level, reducing moist convective instability around the level.  This reduction in mid-tropospheric instability leads to a bottom-heavy mass flux profile in the cumulus clouds, in which most of the ascending motions within the clouds occur at low to middle levels of the troposphere.  The bottom-heavy mass flux profile in turn leads to a reduction in the efficiency of convection for exporting static energy from the convecting region, which requires stronger convection to maintain the energy export.  Meanwhile, lower instability leads to moistening of the convecting region through a process referred to as moisture quasi-equilibrium (a result derived in part from research under AGS-1148594), so that both enhanced moisture and more vigorous overturning motions contribute to intensification of rainfall.  Preliminary work suggesting these relationships was performed using field campaign data from T-PARC/TCS-08 (Thorpex Pacific Asian Regional Campaign/Tropical Cyclone Motion experiment) and PREDICT (Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in the Tropics).  Work performed here further tests and explores the proposed chain of causality from mid-level vorticity to convective precipitation, and also considers mechanisms through which more vigorous convection in turn affects the mid-level vorticity and large-scale circulation.  The work is conducted through both examination of observational data, including data from field campaigns, satellites, and reanalysis products, and the construction of simple models representing the hypothesized relationships.<br/><br/>As noted above, processes leading to the development of convective precipitation in AEWs are of practical as well as scientific interest given that they can lead to landfalling Atlantic hurricanes.  More specifically, the work focuses on the early stages of tropical storm genesis, which is among the most difficult challenges in tropical cyclone forecasting.  The project also fosters international scientific collaboration, as it involves work with a collaborators in Chile and Croatia, and the work is performed at a Hispanic-serving institution.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student and an undergraduate summer intern, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

A recent experiment at Louisiana State University (LSU) has now shown that TGFs are produced by lightning near the Earth's surface, and that the gamma ray intensity at the source is extremely high. The TGF and Energetic Thunderstorm Rooftop Array (TETRA) at LSU shows the existence of ground-level TGFs associated with nearby lightning. This project is a follow-up experiment, TETRA-II, intended to measure the energy and intensity spectrum with improved statistics, extend the energy range, determine the height at which TGFs are produced, and provide for the first time correlated radiation and meteorological data. TETRA-II will be located at two sites in Puerto Rico and Jamaica, at locations where thunderstorm activity is significantly higher than at the current TETRA site in Louisiana and where satellite overflights will enable looking for TGFs simultaneously from the ground and from space.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>Satellite observations of TGFs have shown the connection between the gamma rays and lightning.  Typically, though, it is difficult to associate the gamma ray events with individual well-localized thunderstorms. The ground-level observations reported by TETRA have made it possible to associate the gamma rays with lightning within 3 miles or closer to the detectors, and have made it possible to begin to study the correlations with detailed radar images of the thunderstorms.  TETRA-II will be located in a region chosen to have high lightning density and a high frequency of TGFs seen by orbiting gamma ray satellites; it will be designed to have a factor of 5 better statistics than TETRA for individual events and a higher energy range (up to 10 MeV) so that measurements can be compared to model predictions; and it will be operated in conjunction with both a local array of low frequency (LF, ~100 kHz) lightning detectors and broadband global and regional networks capable of observing intra-cloud in addition to cloud-to-ground lightning, together with nearby radar. As a result, TETRA-II is expected to provide unique and detailed new data about TGFs observed close to lightning, providing new information both about the production mechanisms of the high energy radiation and about the connection with the lightning events.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>TETRA-II will be built and operated largely by a student team.  Equipment funds have been provided by the Louisiana Board of Regents, with the equipment construction to be performed by students from LSU and two nearby HBCUs (Southern University in Baton Rouge and Xavier University in New Orleans).  LSU staff will do the primary design, train and supervise the students, and oversee the construction.  At the same time, an array of low frequency lightning detectors will be deployed and operated by the student teams in Puerto Rico and Jamaica in order to make final determinations of the sites, explore remote operations at the two sites, gain experience with the lightning detection, and organize the Puerto Rico and Jamaica teams to be able to perform continued maintenance and operation of the detectors in the field.  After a year of initial detector construction and testing by the students in Louisiana, the detector array will be deployed during the summer of 2015.  The array will be operated remotely and the data analysis led from Louisiana, with contributions from the student teams in Puerto Rico and Jamaica.<br/>Initial results are expected by the fall of 2015. A goal will be to use TETRA-II to provide research opportunities for students from LSU, Southern, Xavier, Univ. of Puerto Rico, and Univ. of the West Indies in Jamaica for at least 5-10 years. The experiment will also contribute to the development of research capability in Puerto Rico and a developing nation in the Caribbean (Jamaica).

The main aspect of the project will be the deployment of gamma-ray sensors on balloons that will be flown into thunderstorms to collect data.  A potential impact of the project is through the improved understanding of lightning initiation, which may eventually lead to better warnings and lightning safety.  Multiple students would be involved in the project, thereby training the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct balloon-based observations of gamma-ray glows.  The work will improve upon a prior design of a balloon-borne instrument that detects gamma-ray glows using Geiger counters by incorporating an inorganic scintillator and a slow electric field measurement.  Thirty flights are planned over the course of the proposal period from central Florida.  The data, along with Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray propagation, would be used to:  1)  Determine the frequency of gamma-ray glows and their relationship to thunderstorm meteorology and lightning, 2)  Determine source mechanism(s) for gamma-ray glows, 3) Determine discharge currents produced by gamma-ray glows in the source regions, 4)  Constrain electric fields present in glow source regions/lightning initiation regions and determine durations of high fields occurring before lightning, 5)  Determine relationship between glows, lightning and TGFs."

Samples were collected from the beginning of the fires for approximately 2 weeks, through periods of major pollution episodes in the San Francisco Bay region that resulted from the interaction of biomass burning emissions with urban air pollution.  The fires also burned more than 5000 homes and commercial structures, resulting in emissions from the burning of household and commercial items not typically found in emissions from more remote wildfires. This research is expected to be of great public interest due to the focus on emissions from fires that caused stinging eyes and throats, closed schools, and curtailed planned outdoor activities.<br/><br/>This work will quantify the contribution of emissions from these fires to the observed concentrations of organic aerosol, and document how this contribution changes with atmospheric aging.  It is expected to lead to the identification of additional sources contributing to organic aerosol, both primary and secondary, that may influence the aging of the biomass burning emissions.  Gas/particle partitioning data will be used to elucidate information on the formation mechanisms for secondary organic aerosol.  The temporal and chemical resolution provided by the observations during plume aging will be an important tool for investigating fire emission and transformation processes."

Furthermore, this award will advance research and education at a primarily undergraduate institution thereby providing an early experience for students in the conduct of research. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research project will involve the installation of instruments to monitor meteorological, chemical, and hydrologic conditions at three caves spanning a near-coastal transect across northwestern Australia. Environmental variables (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure) in each cave will be integrated with meteorological and rainwater data (including rainfall amounts and stable isotopic compositions) collected at each site, along with the oxygen isotopic ratios of plate-grown spelean carbonate.

This study may also shed light on processes responsible for transport and mixing across the edge of polar vortex in a changing climate.  In the upper troposphere, this is relevant for atmospheric rivers, blocking, and other type of extreme weather that has important societal impacts.  The outcome of the research project is expected to have broad implications across a very wide range of fluid flow problems and generate more dialogues between the theory of dynamical systems and applications to atmospheric and oceanic fluids. One graduate student at UCLA will be trained in analysis of observational data and the use of idealized and comprehensive models of the atmosphere.  Several undergraduates will be trained in data analysis of atmospheric circulation.<br/><br/>The extratropical atmosphere is characterized by the westerly circumpolar flow, with the polar vortex in the stratosphere and the subtropical jet stream in the upper troposphere.  Variations in the stratospheric polar vortex and tropospheric jet stream are critical for the dynamics, chemistry, and predictability of these regions.  Increases in the amplitude of planetary-scale Rossby waves in the stratosphere interrupt the westerly circumpolar flow, resulting a stronger transport of warm air mass into the polar stratosphere and leading to a sudden warming there. The stronger transport of ozone during a stratospheric sudden warming event helps prevent a continuous loss of ozone over the polar regions during dark winter there.  Similarly, the blocked westerly flow in the upper troposphere can impact the transport of energy, momentum as well as water vapor. There is still a lack of understanding about the nonlinear nature of the flow in the presence of large amplitude waves, which limits our ability to predict these events.  <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to gain new knowledge on the fundamental processes at work for the Lagrangian transport (following the motion of air parcel) in the westerly flow from the dynamical systems point of view in conjunction with the theory of transport and mixing in the atmosphere.

The observed patterns will be compared with transport and mixing in a comprehensive chemistry-climate model and chemical compositions in satellite observations at different time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate these waves, with a focus on determining which physical processes in the eyewall region are responsible for generating the dominant (and most observable) waves.  The research will also explore the extent to which the wave frequencies and amplitudes can be correlated with intensity or intensity changes of the storm.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Theoretical understandings of atmospheric convection and TC dynamics require that tropical cyclones radiate gravity waves; these are becoming more and more frequently visible in satellite images.  A number of studies have considered whether these waves play some role in the angular momentum or energy budgets of TCs, or in the formation and propagation of rainbands, but most results have been either negative, contradictory, or inconclusive. With recent increases in computer power and data storage, numerical simulations can be regularly per- formed with 1-km grid spacing and 2 minute output. The field of radiating gravity waves, with several different radial wavelengths and vertical structures simultaneously, can be clearly seen in the vertical wind fields of these simulations.  Power spectral analyses of simulated time series of surface pressure and surface wind speed suggest these waves can also be detected from fixed surface instruments. Along with the output of full-physics simulations, a linear model of vortex dynamics in the atmosphere will be used to explore the relationships between convection and/or vortex dynamics in the eyewall and the properties of the radiating waves.<br/><br/>Furthermore, evidence for these same waves were seen in high frequency observations of pressure and wind from instruments in the Pacific ocean during the passage of typhoons at distances of several hundred kilometers, and also in flight level data from NOAA research aircraft.

Understanding these differences can lead to improvements in hurricane forecast models and their intensity predictions, which ultimately benefit the society. This work will seek to identify distinct relationships between TC intensity, TC motion, and the properties of the radiating waves, which are already found to be observable in surface observations hundreds of kilometers from the storm center.

Some of these clouds are harmless while others can penetrate into and disrupt the space environment around Earth in space weather events called geomagnetic storms. Understanding the solar disturbances that produce storms is important because severe space weather can damage satellites orbiting around Earth, endanger astronauts, and even disrupt power grids on the Earth?s surface. Accurate forecasting of strong magnetic storms is hindered by the fact that the features of a coronal mass ejection observed near the Sun do not remain constant but continually evolve as it moves through the background heliosphere on its way to Earth even interacting with other solar disturbances and with large scale magnetic fields and plasma structures in interplanetary space.  Major storms have occurred due to changes in the structure of the coronal mass ejection during its propagation to Earth. In an effort to understand and eventually better predict the impacts of coronal mass ejections on the Earth?s space environment, this project takes a detailed look at the changes in the characteristics of coronal mass ejections as they move through the heliosphere, and at the physical mechanisms responsible for those changes, by combining remote-sensing and in-situ observations and comparing to large scale simulations.  As an outcome of the project, a large database of events and associated observations will be made available online for the broader scientific community.  Results will be disseminated in scientific publications, and through presentations at workshops and conferences.  The project supports the training of a post doctoral researcher who will be based at the University of New Hampshire but will spend time working with co-investigators at both NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Naval Research Laboratory.  Support of this postdoctoral researcher also serves to broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in a STEM field.  In addition, the project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student each year during the summer months through involvement in high-impact research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a suite of satellites currently observing the inner heliosphere with remote-sensing and in-situ instruments to answer fundamental questions about transient solar disturbances (in particular, coronal mass ejections) and how they change during propagation. These satellites include Wind, ACE, Messenger, STEREO, SOHO, and SDO.  Remote-sensing instruments view the coronal mass ejection as it lifts off the Sun while in-situ instruments measure its internal structure as it sweeps by on its way outward through the heliosphere.  The characteristics of coronal mass ejections are inferred from each type of measurement using previously tested models. A key requirement is a consistent and robust methodology for combining these two very different types of data, which will be applied to some 100 events. As part of the development of the methodology, the discrepancies in the inferred characteristics of the coronal mass ejection from the various data sources will be reconciled.  When combined with large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations a study of the underlying physical mechanisms will be made albeit restricted to a limited number of these cases. Issues to be investigated include: the identification of unclear solar sources, undefined expansion rates, evidence of longitudinal/latitudinal deflections in the propagation, evidence for modifications of the coronal mass ejection due to collisions with solar wind structures or other transient events, and identification of magnetic flux-rope rotations."

This phenomenon has been observed by ground-based detectors in association with both natural and induced lightning, and by space-based detectors. Recently, physicists studying data collected by the 700 square kilometer TA Surface Detector (SD) in Western Utah, U.S.A. have observed energetic elementary particles in coincidence with lightning strikes. In a subset of these events, ""showers"" have been reconstructed which point back to the particles' origin in the Earth's atmosphere. This has not been seen before, and it implies that the energetic radiation may be traced to particular times and features within the lightning strike.<br/><br/>The LMA is the ideal instrument to couple with the TA SD in order to perform these studies. A version of this instrument used for site testing purposes has been temporarily located at the TA site. The LMA consists of nine VHF detectors, spread over hundreds of square kilometers, which detect impulsive radiation from lightning. These impulses may be reconstructed with 10 microsecond timing accuracy and better than 100 meter position accuracy, and used to create a 3-dimensional GPS-timed reconstruction of a lightning strike.<br/><br/>The merger of TA/LMA is also the ideal instrument to search for evidence of a more speculative - but more profound - connection between particle astrophysics and climate: The seeding of lightning strikes by cosmic ray air showers. Since the electric fields present in thunderstorms are typically an order-of-magnitude less than the 30 kV/cm needed for dielectric breakdown of air, it is evident that something else must be assisting the process. The TA/LMA synergy will have the unique ability to search for cosmic ray coincidences with lightning, adding a tantalizing piece of speculative research to its capabilities.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The synergy will create a rare opportunity for particle astrophysics research to have such a direct impact on the national priority of meteorological research. Electrical storms in the atmosphere have had a profound impact on the development of life on Earth, and continue to shape individual human lives and society. Yet mysteries remain as to the causes and nature of lightning. A large cosmic ray observatory is the ideal pairing with a lightning detector to probe two of these mysteries: (1) From where within a lightning strike do high-energy particles arise? (2) Can cosmic ray air showers provide the ""seed"" of atmospheric dielectric breakdown? For the relatively modest cost of maintaining a lightning mapping array, the TA/LMA observatory will become an important showpiece illustrating the benefits of NSF Particle Astrophysics to society as a whole."

During the Holocene, forced changes in the TRB have been invoked to explain many observed failures and increases in tropical rainfall. However, the physical processes driving changes in TRB dynamics and their relationship to climate forcings remain unclear.<br/><br/>This award generally aims to evaluate the drivers of Holocene TRB variations by utilizing a wide network of tropical paleo-hydroclimate records and new isotope-enabled model simulations.  This project aims to: (1) evaluate the response of the TRB's distinct components (convergence over ocean and land, and seasonal monsoons) to Holocene climate forcing functions and feedbacks, including biogeophysical feedbacks and interactions with ENSO; and (2) translate changes in the TRB into changes in proxy recorders, including those based on precipitation isotope ratios.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this project will be achieved through a synthesis of climate proxy records of TRB position and intensity and a series of model experiments with NCAR's isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model (CESM).  Time slices at different stages of the Holocene will provide a climate dynamical context for the synthesized data product. A set of sensitivity experiments will help determine the degree to which biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks and ENSO/TRB (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) interactions influence both isotopic and non-isotopic proxies. A toolkit of emerging proxy system models will be integrated into CESM to compare directly with the network of proxy records. It is expected that this project will help evaluate the forced changes in the TRB projected for the 21st century.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts include upgrading and maintaining the isotopic version of the CESM, enabling the development of a post-doctoral scholar community at the institution, developing discovery-based undergraduate educational experiences, and adding new scientific data and analyses to help improve the understanding of natural climate variability."

Different ways of viewing solar flares include X-rays, radio and chromospheric spectral lines. A large percentage of flares are recognized as a result of associated brightening in the visible light spectrum, and thus are called white-light flares. White-light emission is a signature of large solar flares and can be observed even on other stars. Though the white light emission was the first manifestation of a solar flare ever detected, in the famous so-called Carrington event of September 1, 1959, its origin is still not understood.  This study will compare observation and modeling of the heights in the solar atmosphere where the white-light and hard-X-ray flares originate and through this be able to elucidate and distinguish between competing flare generation mechanisms.  In this way, the investigation tackles fundamental issues related to flare energy transfer in the lower solar atmosphere and the results will provide important information about the generation, energetics and dynamics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, providing crucial understanding of the initiation of space weather events. The research effort will also have major consequences for the study of flaring stars, since the same acceleration and radiation generation processes are at work. These stellar flares are detected in white light, but hard X-ray emission from accelerated electrons is too faint to be directly measured. The results from this effort will better define the relationship between white light and hard X-ray emissions from solar flares.   This information, in turn, will aid the investigation of stellar flares, including particle acceleration and atmospheric conditions of flaring stars.<br/><br/>It is puzzling that the actual mechanism by which solar flares generate white-light  (WL) continuum radiation in the lower atmosphere is not better understood.  The association of WL continuum with the impulsive phase of a solar flare, that is, the phase in which particles are accelerated,  has been interpreted as an indication that non-thermal particles accelerated in the corona can penetrate deep into the lower solar atmosphere, heating those layers and causing intense WL emission. However, flare-accelerated electrons hitting the chromosphere have relatively short collisional ranges, and so their ability to penetrate deeply, as indicated by the close correlation of WL and hard X-ray (HXR) time profiles, is surprising. Other methods of generating the observed WL continuum include energy deposition by protons (instead of electrons) or ""radiative back-warming"" by the UV or X-ray continua. Alfvenic wave transport of energy could also be significant, as could recombination radiation in the chromosphere. Comparison between the heights of WL and HXR emissions in the solar atmosphere will support or rule out many of these proposed generation mechanisms, thereby providing a greater understanding of WL flare generation as well as the overall energetics of solar flares.   The main objective of this study is the determination of the heights in the solar atmosphere of white-light and hard X-ray (HXR) sources for a large sample of flares. Both absolute heights in the solar atmosphere and heights of the two types of emission relative to each other will be studied. The observed heights will be compared with the results of theoretical modeling performed via the radiation hydrodynamic model RADYN and the 3D radiative MHD model RADMHD. The derived heights and model comparisons will reveal in which layers of the outer solar atmosphere WL flare sources originate and will provide new insight into the generation of WL flare emission, an important and poorly-understood problem in solar physics. Source heights will be determined using data from the HMI instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft (for white-light sources),  the RHESSI (for hard X-ray sources), and the EUVI instruments on the twin STEREO spacecraft, as context data, in order to provide an alternate viewing angleand thus precise height measurements. The ground-based GONG++ network will be used to validate the modeling results. Multiwavelength observations from the ROSA and IBIS instruments will be used to characterize white-light flare energetics."

Results from this work are expected to reveal how the interactive effects between the underlying background state of the Pacific and individual El Nio/La Nia events have changed over the longer context of Earth's climate history. Thus, enhanced knowledge of Pacific decadal variability and its historical effects on both global and regional climate will help guide precautionary efforts taken to ameliorate their anticipated economic and societal impacts in the future. This team of researchers continuously and consistently disseminate their research results through the Education and Outreach Program at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center, dedicated to providing climate information to students, the public and policymakers at all levels. In addition, this project provides support, training, and mentoring for a female postdoctoral researcher representing the next generation of the scientists in this field.<br/><br/>Pacific Ocean surface temperatures oscillate between warm and cold phases every few decades, and these multi-decadal shifts in the background state of the Pacific Ocean affect both regional and global climate. On the regional scale, the underlying warm or cold background state of the Pacific Ocean modulates how individual El Nio/La Nia events affect temperature and precipitation in specific areas. To better predict the impacts of El Nio events on global climate, it is essential to know the background state of the Pacific Ocean. However, our current understanding of this behavior is limited due to relatively short modern instrument observational records. Thus, other methods, such as modeling and/or the use of paleoclimate proxy data, are often used to define Pacific Ocean temperatures prior to the instrumental period. The key goal of this project is to establish a history of Pacific decadal variability and its global climatic influences for the past millennium using a combination of global climate model simulations and readily available ice core records from four different regions around the Pacific Basin. Each ice core provides records of local to global scale climate primarily through annual layer thicknesses (accumulation), stable water isotopic ratios (temperature), and concentrations of both insoluble dust and major anions and cations (atmospheric chemistry). Each record provides distinct insights on precipitation and temperature which will be used to reconstruct the history of basin-wide Pacific variability. The model simulations will serve to improve interpretation of the ice core data and advancing the understanding of underlying mechanisms driving the observed ice core responses to Pacific climate variability. The use of the ice core records also helps evaluate and possibly enhance model capabilities to physically represent critical processes responsible for local climate variability across the Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dual polarization radar signatures of tornado debris, called tornado debris signatures (TDSs), have received substantial attention due to their potential to remotely detect tornadoes and characterize tornado damage severity.  This research has the potential to help forecasters use real-time weather radar observations to detect tornadoes and improve the accuracy of impact-based warnings by providing a better estimate of tornado damage/intensity, adding information beyond that afforded by reflectivity and velocity measurements alone. <br/><br/>The research seeks to advance scientific knowledge of how debris characteristics relate to dual polarization radar measurements and how debris and kinematic processes influence the three-dimensional distribution of debris and TDS structure. Moreover, the work provides the first attempt to use radar simulations and observations to explore promising polarimetric radar algorithms to estimate and mitigate debris centrifuging errors with the goal of providing more accurate wind measurements in tornadoes.  This research will be carried out using a debris model initially developed with previous NSF support showing great promise in simulating realistic TDSs.  The use of such a model is crucial because TDSs can change not only due to the types of surfaces or density of debris over which the tornadoes pass, but also due to changes internal to the tornado, the tornado-producing supercell and the near-storm environment, making it difficult to assess the exact mechanisms responsible for observed changes in TDS or tornado circulations.  The model eliminates these variabilities, and allows determination of how the TDS changes may be related to the land cover or tornado intensity while controlling other parameters.  The simulations provide a variety of land cover and debris types to be investigated at different stages in the tornado life cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these clouds are harmless while others can penetrate into and disrupt the space environment around Earth in space weather events called geomagnetic storms. Understanding the solar disturbances that produce storms is important because severe space weather can damage satellites orbiting around Earth, endanger astronauts, and even disrupt power grids on the Earth?s surface. Accurate forecasting of strong magnetic storms is hindered by the fact that the features of a coronal mass ejection observed near the Sun do not remain constant but continually evolve as it moves through the background heliosphere on its way to Earth even interacting with other solar disturbances and with large scale magnetic fields and plasma structures in interplanetary space.  Major storms have occurred due to changes in the structure of the coronal mass ejection during its propagation to Earth. In an effort to understand and eventually better predict the impacts of coronal mass ejections on the Earth?s space environment, this project takes a detailed look at the changes in the characteristics of coronal mass ejections as they move through the heliosphere, and at the physical mechanisms responsible for those changes, by combining remote-sensing and in-situ observations and comparing to large scale simulations.  As an outcome of the project, a large database of events and associated observations will be made available online for the broader scientific community.  Results will be disseminated in scientific publications, and through presentations at workshops and conferences.  The project supports the training of a post doctoral researcher who will be based at the University of New Hampshire but will spend time working with co-investigators at both NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Naval Research Laboratory.  Support of this postdoctoral researcher also serves to broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in a STEM field.  In addition, the project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student each year during the summer months through involvement in high-impact research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a suite of satellites currently observing the inner heliosphere with remote-sensing and in-situ instruments to answer fundamental questions about transient solar disturbances (in particular, coronal mass ejections) and how they change during propagation. These satellites include Wind, ACE, Messenger, STEREO, SOHO, and SDO.  Remote-sensing instruments view the coronal mass ejection as it lifts off the Sun while in-situ instruments measure its internal structure as it sweeps by on its way outward through the heliosphere.  The characteristics of coronal mass ejections are inferred from each type of measurement using previously tested models. A key requirement is a consistent and robust methodology for combining these two very different types of data, which will be applied to some 100 events. As part of the development of the methodology, the discrepancies in the inferred characteristics of the coronal mass ejection from the various data sources will be reconciled.  When combined with large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations a study of the underlying physical mechanisms will be made albeit restricted to a limited number of these cases. Issues to be investigated include: the identification of unclear solar sources, undefined expansion rates, evidence of longitudinal/latitudinal deflections in the propagation, evidence for modifications of the coronal mass ejection due to collisions with solar wind structures or other transient events, and identification of magnetic flux-rope rotations."

Improving the forecasts of blocking events and assessing how the frequency, severity, and location of such events may change with climate change are of substantial societal importance. Synoptic eddies have been shown to play a critical role in the dynamics of atmospheric blocking events by maintaining the blocking pattern but the understanding of their role is currently not sufficiently complete and quantitative. <br/><br/>The goals of the proposed research are 1) to improve the dynamical understanding of atmospheric blocking events through developing a quantitative assessment of synoptic-eddy forcing of blocks. 2) to employ this dynamical understanding to investigate how blocking events will change with climate change and how blocks can be better simulated in climate and weather models. The proposed research will employ numerical experiments with a hierarchy of general circulation models, reanalysis data, and archived results of full-physics general circulation models such as Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models. The research has three components: the first is to study the eddy-forcing mechanism using idealized modeling experiments which to isolate and develop a quantitative understanding of this mechanism. The same idealized framework will be used to investigate how the speed and latitude of jet streams, different patterns of quasi-stationary planetary waves, and moisture modulate this mechanism. The second component is to test this understanding using the reanalysis data and to gain further insight into the dynamic of observed blocking events. The third component is to apply this understanding to examine the performance of full-physics models in simulating blocking, and to provide a more reliable and conclusive prediction on how blocking events will change in the future."

Water vapor is Earth's primary greenhouse gas; clouds play a major role in Earth's radiative energy balance.  Yet there remain significant uncertainties in the understanding of water's radiative roles in the atmosphere.  This uncertainty shows up prominently in cloud-radiation interactions.  Some researchers have suggested there are significant missing pieces of fundamental physics regarding clouds and thermal radiation. The need to understand better the effect of increasing amounts of water in the atmosphere and the implications of missing pieces of cloud-radiation physics are the primary motivations for this project.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to establish a better understanding of the role of thermal radiation in warm cloud droplet evolution: stability, evaporation, and condensation growth.  Lab measurements will focus on radiation-augmented cloud droplet condensation growth and evaporation.  Two separate, complementary laboratory devices are planned: a steady, isobaric flow process with radiative cooling/condensation and an unsteady, batch process with adiabatic expansion cooling followed by radiative heating/evaporation.  Theoretical development and validation will be done for both droplet radiative properties and radiation-augmented mass transfer to obtain mathematical models for interpreting lab data and for microphysical and larger scale cloud simulations.  Both measurements and modeling will be used to provide validation for and better understanding of the role of thermal radiation in cloud droplet evolution.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>This study has intellectual merits at levels ranging from fundamental, scientifically oriented to product oriented.  New knowledge will be generated about radiative- and phase-transitions for the most important thermal regulating substance on the planet.  The findings will impact fundamental questions in cloud physics and atmospheric radiation: uncertain cloud albedos, uncertain aerosol properties, ""anomalous"" shortwave radiation absorption, anomalous longwave emission, water-vapor continuum absorption and emission, and the problem of cloud droplet stability in radiative and thermodynamic environments that are constantly changing.  Remote sensing products and data retrieval will be impacted if this project can exploit spectral changes in condensing IR emission induced by phase-transition radiation to sense the onset of drizzle earlier and more reliably.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This study will also have broader impacts, ranging from individuals to society at-large.<br/>At the individual level this study will most immediately affect the education and career of a PhD graduate student whose aspirations are to become a professor and as part of his graduate training wants to return to his HBCU masters-degree institution and make presentations on research findings and experience in graduate school.  Locally, workshops will be conducted for K-12 students on water properties, phase-change heat transfer, and global climate change in which inexpensive atmospheric radiation and cloud-formation monitors will be built and tested.  This study will also have a broader educational impact by being incorporated into the graduate curriculum at the University of Illinois as a design project.<br/><br/>At a larger, societal level this study will also have far-reaching impact. The radiative phase-transition findings obtained herein will allow a better fundamental understanding of cloud microphysics and may open a door to improved global climate understanding as well as numerical weather prediction.  By exploring the connections between ""anomalous"" infrared water radiation, the water-vapor continuum, and vapor-condensed phase transition, this study is potentially transformative in changing the way atmospheric radiation is modeled. The ultimate broad impact of this project will be a more informed society with a more accurate understanding of the fundamental thermophysical properties of Earth's primary thermal regulating fluid and principal greenhouse substance: water."

Tropical societies and ecosystems rely heavily on monsoon rainfall, and thus understanding the origin and nature of decadal-scale hydroclimate variability is critical to understanding the dynamics at play in such systems.<br/><br/>Recent field studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggests that over the last millennium, the TRB may have contracted during the Little Ice Age (LIA)  thereby producing reduced monsoon rainfall along both the northern and southern margins of the TRB.  In contrast, paleohydrologic and modeling studies show that the global TRB shifted southward meridionally at this time, creating anti-phasing (dry/wet) of rainfall between the TRB northern and southern margins. <br/><br/>The researchers have developed a sub-decadal resolved (~4 year) late Holocene (the last 3,000 years) IASM reconstruction from cave KNI-51 that, when integrated with paleomonsoon records from Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent, reveal not only TRB contraction during the LIA, but expansion and contraction at multi-decadal to centennial time scales over the entirety of the late Holocene. <br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are to extend the KNI-51 stalagmite record through the middle and early Holocene (9,000-3,000 years ago) to examine the nature of TRB dynamics during conditions distinct from those of the late Holocene, including elevated contrasts between summer insolation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, lower eustatic sea level (and increased exposure of Indo-Pacific continental shelf), intervals of reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime. <br/><br/>To better understand atmospheric circulation associated with TRB dynamics, these proxy data will be integrated with climate dynamical analyses of the 6,000 year time slice simulations conducted within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5/Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) framework and with the newly available Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) simulations conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>The project involves the potential for a unique view of TRB variability over the last 9,000 years and provides an important test of the skill of CMIP5-class models to accurately reproduce associated Indo-Pacific atmospheric dynamics.  As the TRB is closely tied to tropical methane production, this research will help refine estimates of regional tropical methane fluxes during the Holocene. The research will be conducted with extensive involvement of undergraduate students thereby providing experience in advanced paleoclimate research and data analysis techniques."

The propagation of GWs through the MLT region affects the transformation and exchange of mass, momentum, and energy at the altitudes of 80 to 110 km. Finally, the research will contribute substantially to undergraduate student education within the USA and will lead to new research opportunities for expanded international collaboration.<br/><br/>The primary goals of this award are: <br/>1.) To measure the occurrence and characteristics of MWs propagating into the MLT region in the lee side of the Southern Andes Mountains (one of the most intense source regions for MWs) using simultaneous complementary high-quality instruments (DLR Rayleigh lidar, SAAMER meteor radar and BU all-sky imager),<br/>2.) To estimate the impact of MWs on the upper atmosphere, via momentum deposition and compare with the forcing induced by non-orographic wave observed during the same period,<br/>3.) To compare the new results with previous observations involving similar instrumentations but with different orographic sources and atmospheric backgrounds: DEEPWAVE (New Zealand) and GW LCYCLE 2 (Scandinavia)."

The absence of large, highly-reflective ice particles or supercooled liquid characteristic of mixed-phase conditions, whose role in aircraft icing is fairly well understood, suggests these regions have high ice water contents (IWCs) dominated by small ice crystals.  Safety hazards inherent in such encounters have motivated a concerted multi-agency, multi-national research effort, the High Ice Water Content Study (HIWC), aimed at characterizing and understanding such conditions.  The primary HIWC field phase will be based out of Darwin, Australia during austral summer monsoon, and will involve penetrations of strong convective oceanic clouds between 0 and -50 degC by a well-instrumented Gulfstream-II aircraft supplied by original HIWC organizers.  The effort described here will allow these additional U.S.-based investigators to access and analyze the unique HIWC dataset in ways complementary those planned by the original organizers of HIWC.<br/><br/>These NSF-supported investigators will focus on the conduct and analysis of model simulations, and on the development of parameterizations suitable for use by such models in oceanic convective clouds to examine the validity of specific hypotheses re: causes of high IWCs in the presence of only small crystals.  These mechanisms to be evaluated include the possibility that:  (1) The presence of near-undilute and very strong updrafts with minimal entrainment, in which homogeneous freezing takes place when supercooled droplets are quickly lofted to high levels (viz. temperatures ranging from-35 to -40 degC), thus resulting large concentrations of small ice crystals in zones where adiabatic water contents exceed 7 grams per cubic meter; (2) A considerable fraction of cloud water in weak (0-10 m/s) updrafts between -10 and 10 degC forms precipitation-sized particles via a ""warm rain"" process, but then freezes and supports ice-multiplication via the Hallett-Mossop process leading to large numbers of small ice crystals that are subsequently lofted to high levels where commercial aircraft operate; (3) Updrafts strong enough to loft raindrops to levels too cold for the Hallett-Mossop process to operate provide condensate loading that slows updrafts so that rain freezes, releasing latent heat that subsequently invigorates deep upper-level convection favoring graupel/ice generating high concentrations of small particles; (4) Narrow, unsteady ""multi-turreted"" updrafts exhibiting a high degree of small-scale variability exist such that any/all of the above mechanisms might operate at specific times and/or locations; and (5) Aircraft malfunctions occurring in exposures thought to be associated with high IWC values are actually the result of extended flight through anvils possessing IWCs only in the more moderate range of 1-2 grams per cubic meter.  These investigators will focus on analysis of in-situ observations from cloud microphysics probes to quantify how the slope, shape and y-intercept of assumed gamma-type cloud and precipitation particle size distributions (as commonly employed in mesoscale models) vary with key prognostic variables such as IWC, temperature, and vertical air velocity with attention to differing conditions encountered in convective cores, nearby cloud anvils, or other more distant regions.  They will also conduct model simulations, to be evaluated against HIWC in-situ and remote sensing data, to explore the validity of the above hypotheses for explaining the existence of high IWC regions consisting of large number of small particles and to further develop and evaluate parameterizations used in such models.  NSF support will also allow this team to directly participate in G-II test flights (planned for Florida during late-summer of 2013) and follow-on preliminary analyses to be conducted in advance of the primary field activities to be based out of Darwin.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this effort rests upon early access to a unique dataset (collected at no direct cost to NSF) and combined observational and model-based analysis of microphysical conditions thought to uniquely occur in and around the cores of some tropical-oceanic thunderstorms in order to better characterize mechanisms involved in generation of high ice water content conditions thought to impact commercial aircraft.  Broader Impacts will derive from improved understanding of processes and conditions contributing to aviation hazards for high flying commercial airliners and including those that may be experienced by NSF's Gulfstream-class research aircraft, and through development of improved parameterizations for tropical clouds as applicable to both numerical models and remote sensing retrieval schemes relevant to evaluation of global climate models.  Further impacts will come through hands-on involvement in field data collection and associated training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows involved in this research."

In order to further study this concept, researchers will perform simulations using advanced numerical models and compare those results to observational data to assess how the models are performing.  This study will impact society by providing better information to policymakers about the impact of future land use changes.

While the study of land use land cover change (LULCC) impacts on climate are not new, this project is starting from a point where the model consensus is that there will be a strengthened coupling between land and atmosphere in a warming climate.  This result would mean that climate may become more sensitive to both natural and anthropogenic variations at the land surface.  Two main hypotheses will be addressed: 1) Regions of strong land-atmosphere feedback in the physical climate system will evolve significantly in a changing climate, and 2) regionally, the rate of climate change, the frequency and severity of extremes, and the predictability of climate variability will be dependent on the type of land use practices implemented in the coming decades.  To address these hypotheses, the PIs plan to use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a focus on the Community Land Model (CLM) and Community Atmosphere Model (CAM).

These data will be used to test hypotheses regarding the genesis and subsequent distribution of melting icebergs associated with the Heinrich events of the last glaciation and to provide insights into the interactions of cryosphere and ocean circulation.<br/><br/>The catastrophic iceberg discharge (Heinrich) events that punctuated the last ice age were among the largest known interactions of the Earth's cryosphere, ocean, and climate. Although there is continued debate about their causes and consequences, in at least a subset of the events, the evidence is consistent with their likely influence on the salinity and stability of the subpolar Atlantic, significant weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), cooling of the northern hemisphere, warming of the southern hemisphere, and shifts in the global hydrological cycle and large-scale atmospheric circulation and composition.  Yet deposits associated with two of the six events originally identified during the last glaciation have very different sedimentary characteristics in the eastern subpolar North Atlantic, where they have most commonly been compared.

The negatively charged graupel fall and lower whereas the positively charged crystals ascend with the updraft, thus separating the charges and increasing the electric field until its breakdown in the form of lightning flashes.  The existence of supercooled cloud droplets and strong updrafts that are required for the process can be ascribed to both thermodynamic and aerosol properties of the air mass. Disentangling the dynamic and aerosol effects is a long-standing question, because the aerosol and thermodynamic properties are often not independent. This study addresses this challenge with a new combination of observational tools that are applied to this problem for the first time.  The cloud microstructure is retrieved by the new NPP/VIIRS satellite measurements that will provide retrieved cloud properties at a resolution of 375 m.  Ground-truth aerosol measurements will be continuously available. The Houston Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and the central Oklahoma LMA will provide accurate 3-dimensional mapping of the lightning sources and their polarity. The new polarimetric radars will provide the evolution of the precipitation in the clouds. These measurements will be conducted over the Houston area, which has refineries and other sources of air pollution. Similar clouds in and outside of the Houston pollution plume will be examined for separating the aerosol from thermodynamic effects on cloud microstructure, precipitation forming processes and electrification, including charging polarity. Similar studies will be conducted in central Oklahoma.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to the education of several undergraduate and graduate students who will directly participate in the research, which will include their sharing in data acquisition and analysis. Included in this study is support for students who will write theses and dissertations and present their results at seminars and professional meetings.

In order to better understand the variability of dust loading in the atmosphere it is important to study how dust aerosols are transported from the surface to the atmosphere, a process known as saltation.  This award will provide funding for observations and analysis of data from the Owens Lake playa in California, a dry lake bed that is known as a significant source of dust pollution.  The research will seek to determine the roles of soil particle size distribution, crusted soil, water content, and dust electrification in saltation.  The long-term societal benefits of the project are through better representation of dust in the weather and climate system, thereby improving forecasts.  In the shorter-term the researchers will work with the Owens Valley air quality officer, offering a direct link to health effects, and the project will also contribute to the education and training of students.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate the effects of soil composition, particle size distribution, and soil water content on the depth of the saltation layer, the intensity of saltation, the electric fields generated by saltation, and the PM2.5 aerosol concentration as a function of wind shear stress in a variety of weather phenomena and climate conditions.  The campaign is primarily observational, with instrumentation residing in the Owens Lake salty playa in California.  The three main objectives of the work are in the following areas:  1) Saltation and dust lifting - Continued and improved measurements will be used to test competing hypotheses about the correlation between vertical dust flux and near surface humidity, 2) Effects of electric fields on dust lifting - Electric field data would be used to test the hypothesis that electric forces attract saltating particles toward the surface, inhibiting increases in the depth of the saltation layer with increases in wind shear stress at the surface, and 3)  Dusty weather phenomena - The researcher will study the intensity and depth of the saltation layer and dust lifting in weather phenomena ranging from small-scale dusty plumes and vortices to larger-scale dust storms to accurately quantify the contributions from each to the dust cycle.  The hypothesis that dust lifted by convective events is much richer in fine particles will also be tested."

Such a predictive capability would be a societal benefit to the United States in that it could result in better resource planning and management. A further benefit of the project is the support of a graduate student at a minority serving university. <br/><br/>Speleothems from regional caves provide an opportunity to observe possible changes in the modalities of these climate modulators over the long term and have demonstrated their fidelity to isotopic, chemical and physical climate proxies that are radiometrically datable using advances in uranium-series based chronometry.<br/><br/>The project will specifically collect and evaluate data from two sites with different seasonal hydrologic cycles with the aim of isolating the seasonal component of observed changes and the responsible climate variables. For example, the North American Monsoon (NAM) is modulated by changes in the AMO.

Despite many theoretical, numerical, and observational analyses conducted to date, which make a strong case for the NLLJ arising from a force imbalance induced by the sudden release of the frictional constraint near sunset, many aspects of NLLJs structure and evolution are still not well understood. A claim perpetuated in the literature regarding a close association between the height of the NLLJ and the top of the SBL does not hold up to scrutiny: the depth of the SBL generally increases throughout the night while many observations indicate that wind maxima often descend, remain steady, or rise during the night. It is also not clear how the terrain slope angle influences the relationship between the SBL and NLLJ structures. A number of recent studies suggest that the nature of turbulence within the developing SBL as it interacts with an NLLJ should be further investigated. Open questions also remain concerning the impacts of wind-profile curvature associated with NLLJs on bore propagation, interactions of NLLJs with mesoscale disturbances, and the mechanisms by which NLLJ/bore interactions may lead to convective initiation. Our study aims at providing new knowledge about the interactions between the NLLJ, developing nocturnal SBL, propagating mesoscale disturbances, and convective initiation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>NLLJs exert significant and wide-ranging impacts on regional weather and climate by providing dynamic and thermodynamic support for the development of deep convective storms and heavy precipitation events over the Great Plains. They are efficient conveyors of moisture and lower-tropospheric air pollutants, such as ozone and fine particulates, as well as agricultural pests including fungi, spores, and insects. NLLJs also have major impact on the wind-energy industry since the enhanced winds provide a dependable source of energy, but the associated wind shear and turbulence can damage wind-turbine rotors. The downward transport of NLLJ momentum in the morning by convective turbulent mixing may produce strong and gusty surface winds that can intensify wildfires and generate dust storms. The integrated analysis of high-resolution observations and numerical model output in the proposed project will allow improving of SBL parameterizations currently employed in atmospheric models and lead to better predictions of the NLLJ and its role in the initiation of nocturnal convection. The use of state-of-the-art observational systems and advanced numerical simulations techniques will provide a superb opportunity for student training. Both graduate and undergraduate students will play important roles during field operations, in model studies, in data processing, and in scientific analyses."

Conceptual and numerical models of these phenomena have only been evaluated by their effects on external phenomena, rather than how well the models represent the actual internal processes themselves.  Three scientific objectives are identified that will lead to a better description and understanding of entrainment, decoupling, and coherent updraft and downdraft fluxes:  1) Relating entrainment to the strength of turbulence in the stratocumulus cloud and documenting diurnal variations of turbulence and its transport due to variation of buoyancy flux at cloud top, 2) Documenting the structure and evolution of turbulence leading to decoupling between the stratocumulus cloud and surface mixed layer, and analyzing both diurnal decoupling driven by the cycle of solar radiation, and decoupling associated with large-scale cold advection over warm SST, and 3) quantifying mass transports due to cumulus updrafts and downdrafts generated by negative buoyancy from cloud and drizzle evaporation, and attributing the observed distributions of vertical velocity to turbulence strength, decoupling, cumulus clouds, and drizzle."

The ALO site also includes a Na wind-temperature lidar and a meteor radar. Data from the AIC2 and the other ALO instruments will be used to investigate the breakdown into turbulence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs) and to measure the turbulent viscosity.

There is a significant societal impact in helping scientists better communicate and teach their expertise. There are thousands of scientists in geoscience-related fields who are teaching, researching, publishing, and communicating with colleagues in the STEM community and the public at large. These scientists, and their work, will become increasingly important in future scientific and public discussions on complex STEM concepts.<br/><br/>The project team will build on the success of previously-funded Workshops; expand the number of participants who benefit from the Workshops; further refine the Workshop materials and methodology; and implement and evaluate new materials to reach more participants in other STEM disciplines.  Each Workshop includes a diverse group of approximately twenty-four science participants, an equal number of law students (law students are not supported with NSF funds), and an experienced cadre of practicing lawyers, judges, and legal educators.<br/><br/>The Workshops will include simulations where participants communicate and teach complex STEM concepts to non-scientists in a range of challenging settings. During the workshops, participants learn and practice the role of both scientists and non-scientists to: 1) develop and build upon skills necessary to effectively communicate their expertise; 2) understand the culture and perspectives of non-scientists; and 3) develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different challenges in communicating and teaching complex STEM concepts to non-scientists.

Weather modification and hydraulic fracking are issues of increasing interest in science and policy circles.  Some previous scientist participants in the Workshop are now actively engaged in research, application, and policy aspects in these fields and have benefited from exposure to the culture of the law and regulation.

The research component examines the connection between monsoons and the deserts typically found adjacent to monsoon regions on the poleward side (as, for instance, the Sahara is poleward of and adjacent to the Sahel).  Previous work by the PI shows that variations in precipitation in several monsoon regions including the Sahel, South Asia, and Australia, are positively correlated with equivalent potential temperature below the cloud layer over adjacent poleward deserts.  One hypothesis for this relationship is that desert heat lows produce shallow overturning circulations in which outflow near the 700mb level has an equatorward component which reduces monsoon precipitation by warming and drying the mid-troposphere over the region of monsoonal deep convection.  To advance understanding of such monsoon-desert relationships, work under this award will address three main questions: 1) Does shallow flow in desert heat lows alter monsoon precipitation primarily through horizontal advection of moisture and dry static energy?  2) How important are low-level transient eddies in interactions between desert heat lows and monsoons?  3) Do heat lows interact with monsoon precipitation in fundamentally the same way in West Africa, South Asia, and Australia? These research questions are addressed through a three-part research agenda in which the tasks are 1) characterize the monsoon-desert relationships found in observations, based on a combination of in situ, satellite, and reanalysis datasets; 2) explore these relationships using a simple theoretical model; and 3) conduct process studies using a state-of-the-art numerical model.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER proposal involves the development of a monsoon forecasting contest with three goals:  1) fostering education on weather, climate, and relevant basic science; 2) enhancing recruitment and retention of high-promise, underrepresented high school students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields; and 3) creating an international community for disseminating and discussing monsoon forecasts and research. The monsoon forecasting contest is held through a website which allows participants to enter forecasts of onset date and total seasonal precipitation for the monsoon regions of West Africa, India, Australia, and North America.  Participants are asked to submit a rationale along with their predictions, and the website also contains educational materials on monsoons, along with basic science explanations for convection, generation of wind from pressure gradients, and other relevant topics.  Guidance for forecasters, including climatological monsoon onset date and precipitation amount, the state of El Nino, and links to operational products. As part of the forecasting contest, the project seeks the participation of inhabitants of monsoon regions as forecasters and as bloggers, to provide a real-world perspective on monsoons and their human impacts. The forecasting contest is accompanied by an educational outreach effort to the New Haven Public School system. The outreach is conducted through the Science Collaborative Hands-On Learning And Research (SCHOLAR) program, in which students take part in a three-week residential summer science program at Yale. The PI is working with SCHOLAR staff to develop a short science module on weather, climate, and monsoons.  In addition, in the last three years of the project, two students will be selected to attend a field trip organized by the PI's department."

Specifically, the research aims to provide insights into the relative contributions of the West African Monsoon (WAM), extratropical cyclones, Mediterranean cold air surges, and tropical plumes to African Humid Period (AHP) rainfall (~14,800 - 5,000 years Before Present. <br/><br/>At millennial timescales, northern Africa experienced dramatic climate and environmental change. During the early to mid-Holocene AHP, the world's largest present-day hot desert, the Sahara, received abundant rainfall and supported widespread lakes, wetlands, and vegetation.  Given the critical role of the present-day Sahara in Earth's radiation budget and its influence on Sahel rainfall, global mineral dust concentrations, biogeochemical cycles, and tropical cyclogenesis, climate variability in the Sahara, such as that observed during the Holocene, has profound impacts on the global climate system.  By evaluating the contribution of these processes to AHP rainfall, the research will assist in interpreting the sources of moisture recorded in proxy records from the Sahara-Arabian desert belt which are currently ambiguous because they lie near the border of the tropical monsoon and mid-latitude rainfall regimes. <br/><br/>An assessment of the impact of the new dynamic soil albedo scheme within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) will offer tangible insights for climate model development and improved simulation of the AHP.

As part of our participation in Earth Camp, the participants in this project will develop and instruct a one-day atmospheric science and climate component to the first summer experience in Ann Arbor, MI and create a four-day component for the second summer experience at the U-M field station in Wyoming. In addition to broadening URM participation in the earth sciences, this project will also support the training and career-development of a young scientist and at least one undergraduate student."

Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution are significantly affected by Space Weather, and the climatology of the near-Earth space environment. The ability to forecast disturbances which may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, comprising the disciplines of solar physics, heliospheric physics, magnetospheric physics and aeronomy.  This project is funded under the Faculty Development in Space Sciences program, the aim of which is to ensure the health and vitality of solar and space physics on university teaching faculties.  Through the creation of new tenure-track faculty positions within the intellectual disciplines that comprise the space sciences, research topics in solar and space physics will be integrated into basic physics, astronomy, electrical engineering, geoscience, meteorology, computer science, and applied mathematics programs, and lead to the development of space physics graduate programs capable of training the next generation of leaders in this field. <br/><br/>This project will support a new tenure-track faculty position in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign (UI), with the purpose of expanding the breadth and depth of the research and teaching expertise within the Remote Sensing and Space Sciences group.   Specifically, the new hire will target several high priority areas in space science, including: high-performance scientific computing and numerical modeling and simulation of the space environment; novel electro-optics technology for probing the space environment; novel sensor technology for distributed (constellation) sensing of the space environment; and space flight hardware design and development. Building on existing key courses, the new faculty member will work with senior faculty members in the group to develop a full, formal curriculum in remote sensing and space sciences, which does not currently exist at UI.   Further, UI is pioneering the development of Massive Open Online Courses, through which the new hire will have a unique opportunity to impact space science education on a global scale.    The additional hire will further strengthen and grow existing partnerships with several departments and centers and will also be encouraged to pursue new partnerships broadly with the space sciences community.  To this end,  funds are included in the budget for the new faculty member to host small targeted workshops in the 2nd and 4th years of the program on a research topic of their choice to encourage outside partnerships.  Utilizing several established and successful departmental and institution wide programs the project will work to ensure a strong focus on increasing diversity in the recruiting both of students into the program and of the new faculty member."

REU interns will conduct research in areas of mesoscale and synoptic weather, microclimates, biometeorology, mountain meteorology, modern climate, and paleoclimate to better understand their physical processes, their predictability, and impact on society. The primary objective of the NEPARS REU site is to provide learning opportunities to a promising and diverse group of undergraduates which will help them prepare for careers in STEM fields by conducting quality scientific research, building professional networks, improving leadership skills, and developing effective communication skills.  Each year a cohort of 12 undergraduate students will be offered paid summer research positions with the NEPARS REU to work with faculty mentors from Hobart & William Smith Colleges (HWS) and Plymouth State University (PSU). Six students and three mentors will work at each research location during a 9-week summer research program. Additionally, the NEPARS REU will partner with the Mt. Washington Observatory and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at SUNY Albany to offer interactions beneficial to REU student professional development. The NEPARS REU site has a primary focus on participation of rising sophomores and rising juniors that have just completed their first and second year, respectively, at two-year or four-year colleges and universities across the U.S. offering degrees in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The REU site will be structured so that students work in pairs with a mentor.  This will allow the students to develop experience working as part of a research team, while they will also learn autonomy of research with their own individual project within the team.  Modern technology, such as video-conferencing, will be leveraged so that students can communicate across the two locations.  The REU site has 4 objectives for students: 1) interact with, learn from, and conduct research investigations with their peers and dedicated mentors through the use of REU pairings and a REU cohort across two research locations, 2) explore and discover the social, cultural, and geographic diversity of others with comparable academic interests from similar or vastly different colleges and universities, 3) cultivate a greater understanding of atmospheric and related sciences beyond the extent taught in the undergraduate classroom and lab, including the development  and enhancement of research skills while working with observational and modeling datasets, and 4) develop effective leadership and communication skills through a series of workshops and opportunities to interact with professionals within the scientific community.  Additionally the REU site has developed two objectives for the REU mentors: 1) increase interactions between two primarily undergraduate institutions to strengthen the respective programs and support new, as well as existing, faculty research collaborations, and 2) enhance faculty development as undergraduate mentors through training, faculty-to-faculty mentoring, and by working with a diverse student population from a variety of academic institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study will utilize a publicized database of 122 sawtooth events, comprising nearly 500 individual oscillations, which occurred during the FAST era (October 1996 to April 2009). About two thirds of these have coverage of the nightside aurora. This constitutes a sufficiently large set of events to allow for a comparison between the two main solar-wind drivers of Sawtooth events (SIR-driven and ICME-driven events, respectively) and to be able to compare these with the outflow from non-sawtooth events.

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Work supported under this award contributes to the campaign by adding a weather station in a region of interest.  The station provides continuous surface observations (winds, pressure, temperature, etc) as well as weather balloon launches to record vertical profiles of atmospheric conditions.  It is located at Nuqui (6N, 77W), on the west coast of Colombia.  The site is chosen for its proximity to the Choco' jet,  a low-level jet flowing northward over Choco' Province, which extends from the Serrania del Baudo', the western fork of the Andes in Colombia, to the Pacific coast.<br/><br/>The jet is of interest to OTREC because it extends significantly offshore and may contribute substantially to rainfall in the OTREC study area. It may also play a key role in the generation of easterly waves.  The PIs hypothesize that the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling over the western slopes of the Andes accounts for the diurnal cycle of offshore convection, despite differences in timing. They also argue that the Andean topography plays a role in organizing the rain-bearing mesoscale convective systems found over Choco' Province and the adjacent ocean.<br/><br/>The Nuqui station will operate through August and September, with balloon launches four times per day when the OTREC aircraft is collecting data over the eastern Pacific (see OTREC award 1758513).  The station is also complementary to rainwater sampling under OTREC award 1759255, for which Nuqui is one of three collection sites.  The project is also a follow-on to ChocoJex, a Colombian-led field campaign focused specifically on the Choco' jet.<br/><br/>A better understanding of extreme precipitation and its relationship to low-level jets is desirable for societal as well as scientific reasons. Research under this award directly addresses these issues, with a particular focus on hazardous mesoscale convective systems.  The work also addresses easterly waves, which can spawn destructive hurricanes.

SAAMER was installed on Tierra del Fuego (TdF) to observe the large-scale dynamics within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) in the altitude range of 75 to 95 km.  This height range is where the semidiurnal tide and various planetary waves have a range of diverse effects.  This location is within a latitude band where these motions have large responses, but also where the existing MLT database of winds and temperatures is quite sparse. The SAAMER location on TdF was also motivated by the occurrence of the major 'hotspot' of gravity wave (GW) activity on Earth centered over the Southern Andes, Drake Passage, and Antarctic Peninsula. This hotspot is due to the major GW sources in this region, which include high mountains, strong jet streams, and the passage of vigorous frontal systems. These sources yield large GW events and significant MLT momentum fluxes (MF).  Strong interactions of GW structures with the larger-scale motions in the MLT region are to be expected, and SAAMER results to date confirm expectations that the fluxes in this region would be very large. This work has also revealed an ability to characterize meteor head echoes, non-specular meteor trails, and meteor radiants observed in routine measurement modes.  The new SAAMER studies would be more comprehensive than before due to correlative airglow imaging as well as new local Rayleigh lidar and multi-receiver radar measurements combined with the use of satellite observations by SABER on TIMED and CIPS on AIM for large- and small-scale dynamics studies. These multi-instrument studies will enable quantification of the important small-scale GWs (and MFs) having wavelengths h~20-100 km that are challenging to quantify without such correlative measurements. MLT dynamical studies, especially in regard to the quantification of GW dynamics, momentum transport and its deposition, are central needs in defining more accurate parameterizations of these dynamics in global research, weather prediction, and climate models addressing broad societal needs. Measurements of large-scale dynamics likewise serve to constrain models of these dynamics, especially at high southern latitudes. Meteoroid trajectory studies may provide clues to potential meteor impact risks. SAAMER is also an educational and training tool through various NSF programs devoted to promoting international collaborative activities between U.S. and S. American researchers and students, including extensive exchanges between the U.S., Argentina, and Brazil to date.<br/><br/>The research award to the PI would address MLT dynamics, meteors, and microphysics with focus upon the following questions:<br/>1) Continued Large-scale dynamics studies of mean winds, tides, and PWs and their structure, interactions, and inter-hemispheric and inter-annual variability;<br/>2) Further quantification of momentum fluxes by small-scale GWs employing SAAMER, the BU all-sky imager, and the IAP Rayleigh lidar, with exploration of GW sources and their propagation characteristics combined with the study of possible development of secondary GW generation, and influences by mean winds, tides, and PWs;<br/>3) Further characterization of the meteoroid population, velocities, trajectories, diurnal, seasonal, and global variability of meteor rates, and the meteoric mass flux into the MLT; and<br/>4) Routine measurements of meteor head echoes and non-specular trails and PMSE allowing studies addressing meteor ablation and PMSE microphysics."

The WCTT is expressed as a pressure trough and tongue of warm air near the surface that extends into the Pacific Northwest from an area of low pressure over the southwestern U.S. Summer thermal troughs are associated with heat waves and poor air quality, and greatly impact renewable energy production and wildfire growth. Winter thermal troughs play a role in many western North America coastal snow events. The project will begin by completing a series of case studies, using both high-resolution model simulations and dense regional observations, to determine the detailed structural evolution of western North America thermal troughs, as well as to determine the physical mechanisms responsible for their generation and maintenance. Particular attention will be given to thermal trough passage across regional terrain barriers; such passages are often associated with sharp transitions in wind and temperature that can lead to wildfire blow-ups and rapid changes in wind energy. This work will determine whether thermal trough frequency, intensity, and evolution have changed over the past half-century using high-resolution gridded model reanalysis data sets, and then will evaluate whether natural variability (such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) or anthropogenic warming might explain such changes. It will also evaluate the potential of anthropogenic global warming for changing the characteristics of western U.S. thermal troughs over the next century. To do so, global climate models forced by a variety of greenhouse gas scenarios will be dynamically downscaled to high resolution (12 km) using a regional climate model. These fields will then be input into objective algorithms that will determine the trends in thermal trough frequency and intensity. Specific hypotheses regarding the effects of global warming on thermal trough intensity and frequency will be evaluated.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>The work completed under this award will provide a comprehensive description of a feature that dominates the weather of western North America during the summer, with similar phenomena observed throughout the world. This work will not only describe the detailed structural evolution of such features, but their basic physical mechanisms as well. The research will determine the long-term temporal trends in thermal trough development and evaluate the origins of these trends. It will examine whether global warming will change the frequency and intensity of WCTTs, and will explain the mechanisms behind these changes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>Improved understanding of this phenomenon will lead to substantial societal benefits. Thermal troughs have a large impact on regional temperatures, wildfire development and control, renewable energy, air quality, and other critical societal issues. The understanding generated by this proposal should help improve our ability to predict thermal trough development and evolution, provide insights into expected long-term trends associated with global warming, and suggest expected changes in regional temperature extremes, renewable energy potential, and wildfire frequency."

This project aims to explain part of the variability in the eastward propagating speed of MJO by linking it to slowly evolving background winds. Through analysis of observed and model data, this project will identify how these background winds alter the movements of the regions of tropical rainfall and the associated global weather patterns. A unique combination of statistics and the background momentum budget analyses will help to isolate the roles of tropical intrusion of extratropical disturbances in regulating the background wind system and thereby inter-event variations of eastward propagating speeds of MJO.<br/><br/>Weather models do not predict well how these tropical rainfall patterns evolve. The improved understanding of how MJO interacts with the global weather would help improve weather forecasting in the important period for decision, 2-5 weeks into the future.

The results of this project have the potential to improve air quality modeling by better representing ecosystem feedbacks to ozone pollution. <br/><br/>The team of scientists plan to collect two years of continuous data at the Virginia Forest Laboratory (VFL) in central Virginia, coupling ozone flux measurements with observations of canopy-level photosynthesis by solar induced fluorescence (SIF), isomer-resolved ozone-reactive biogenic organic compounds (BVOCs), and critical ecosystem parameters of canopy conductance and carbon dioxide exchange.

Variability in ozone flux to the canopy caused by these BVOCs can be quantified by their molecular identities and concentrations;  (3): Uptake of ozone by plants leads to one or more of 3 detectable and significant ozone-ecosystem feedbacks: (a) ozone uptake reduces stomatal conductance, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against plant uptake; (b) ozone uptake reduces canopy BVOC concentrations by impairing photosynthesis, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation; and (c) ozone uptake enhances BVOC emissions, leading to shorter ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation.

The new High Frequency (HF) heating facility with the ISR (Incoherent Scatter Radar) and other instruments provides a unique opportunity to study heating-related aeronomic and plasma physics problems. This includes the rapidly-imaged observation of airglow at 557.7 nm, 630.0 nm and 427.8 nm during ionospheric ""heating"" campaigns to understand the role of HF-heating in generating plasma bubbles, or modulating them if already present, and to understand the role of secondary suprathermal electrons in producing airglow at different wavelengths.  This research will also yield insight to the heating process, including locating ionospheric ""hot-spots"", yielding details of the electron collision process, elucidating the role of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the strongly heated regions, and study of heating effects in Sporadic E. The latter study will include Ca+ metal-lidar observations as further defined by 555.7 nm imaging as well as ISR and HF radar results. HF heating of the ionosphere offers a unique opportunity to investigate the plasma heating process and its effects on the neutrals in a controlled (experimental) fashion. Outside of the heating campaigns, a database of 630 nm all-sky camera images from other locations will be assembled collaboratively to investigate the global context of the omnipresent ~1 hr period ionospheric waves, and associated dynamics, first identified with the AO ISR. This work will utilize other AO instruments, including the resonance and Rayleigh lidars, to investigate the role of wave coupling from lower atmospheric regions. Also, a proposed new CCD camera will allow high speed imaging to better understand HF heating effects and linking optical and radar meteors to study meteoroid aeronomy. The response of the SAIR to sudden changes in the environment caused by heating will be explored with the collaborative use of multiple instruments, thus informing numerous geophysical research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of this work will help to establish collaborations with plasma physicists, modelers, and space weather scientists. It will also advance the AO cluster capabilities with the addition of a User-Owned, Public Access (UOPA) high frame rate CCD to the current imager and help in establishing international collaborations. Students representing minorities from local universities in Puerto Rico will be encouraged to participate in observations and data analysis. They will be involved in the improvements of the optical systems including training on AO instrumentation and the application of these instruments to study aeronomy of the SAIR."

The project is designed by experts on the MLT and the lower atmosphere. These research communities have not worked closely together before, but a coupled approach is required to address these dynamics in a comprehensive and consistent manner. GWs strongly influence the dynamics and climate throughout the atmosphere. DEEPWAVE will provide a more complete understanding of GW generation, propagation, breakdown, and energy and momentum transport in the presence of large topography, cyclones, and strong wind shears than has been possible previously.<br/> At the core of the project is a 6-week deployment of the NSF Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft to Christchurch in June and July 2014. The GV flights will take place over mountain wave locations over and downwind of New Zealand, Tasmania, and islands in the Southern Ocean as well as the southern circumpolar jet that is an additional strong GW source. Recent satellite remote sensing has identified this region as a primary global ""hotspot"" of GWs reaching high altitudes.  Using the GV in situ instruments, dropsondes, and three new airborne remote sensing instruments, nearly the full vertical propagation path of GWs can be observed.<br/>  The GV will fly at altitudes from 9-13 km with in situ instruments observing the structure and fluxes of GWs up to ~18 km. On the GV, high-power Rayleigh and Na resonance lidars and an advanced mesospheric temperature mapper (AMTM) will map out GW structures from ~15 to 100 km. These state-of-the-art measurements will be supplemented by ground-based balloon and remote sensing instruments. <br/> This 4-year research program includes DEEPWAVE measurements in 2014, and extensive analysis efforts and associated modeling to quantify the observed dynamics thereafter. All DEEPWAVE data will be made available in a timely fashion. In addition to the investigators supported by this collaborative award, participants supported by NRL as well as international collaborators from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK will be closely involved in the DEEPWAVE project."

This is the most economically developed and densely populated region of the country. Improved model representation of these processes is a crucial step in the overall goal of improving forecasts and projections of these high-cost events, thereby mitigating their impacts.  <br/><br/>Processes that cause extreme precipitation over daily to weekly periods in the Northeast US will be identified. The ability of current climate models to reproduce these processes will be examined.  The two motivating questions are:  What types of storms cause extreme precipitation in the Northeast?   Do current models correctly reproduce these storms types and their relationship to extreme precipitation?  Using observational data, storm types associated with extreme precipitation will be identified by applying advanced analytic techniques. Characteristic patterns in the jet stream and other storm features that occur in association with extreme precipitation will be identified.  This analysis will then be undertaken  on the climate model output to identify the storm types that are produced in the models and compare the modeled types to the observed types.  The differences will be highlighted for use in model development and for providing context for model forecasts and projections.  The physical processes by which the extreme precipitation are generated within each storm type will also be investigated. The relative strength of different factors that are known to influence precipitation, such as the amount of moisture in the lower atmosphere, will be examined within each storm type. After the key factors are identified, their influence will then be further tested in a regional, high resolution model by changing the strength of individual factors and examining how the modeled precipitation changes in response."

This information is a missing link in our knowledge of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, which is hindering progress on this frontier. The proposed effort, which lays the groundwork for follow-on global modeling studies in the community, has the potential to significantly advance knowledge possibly even triggering a breakthrough in our understanding of Geospace electrodynamic coupling. The proposers plan to create a state-of-the-art empirical model of height-integrated electrical conductivities in the polar region by taking advantage of large datasets of magnetic field, electric field, and electric current measurements from recent and ongoing satellite missions and ground-based instrumentation.  A new feature of the empirical model will be the ability to produce, for the first time, height-integrated electrical conductivity patterns as a function of solar EUV irradiance, the tilt of the Earth's magnetic dipole with respect to the Sun and the interplanetary magnetic field orientation - all of which are known to organize the spatial and temporal behavior of the conductivity as well as its magnitude. This is particularly important because ionospheric conductivity makes possible the closure through the upper atmosphere of currents that are generated by the interaction between the magnetosphere and the solar wind.  It is also a key factor in determining how energy from these currents is deposited. Despite the critical role of the conductivity in driving the behavior of Geospace, it is still one of the most poorly known quantities because direct measurements are extremely difficult to make and direct observations of its global features have not yet been possible. The project provides training for a graduate student thus contributing to the future scientific workforce.  The advances in knowledge about coupling within the Geospace system will likely lead to improved models and ultimately to better space weather predictions of value to society.<br/>  <br/>The method for deriving ionospheric height-integrated conductivity requires electric fields supplied by an existing empirical model (which will be improved), divergence-free currents obtained from inversion of ground-based magnetometer data and curl-free currents obtained from satellite magnetometers.  The curl-free current component is essentially the closing current through the ionosphere for magnetospheric field-aligned currents. If field lines are approximately vertical as in the polar regions, the current loop formed by the field-aligned and curl-free current produces no magnetic signature at the ground; hence the need for satellite observations of the magnetic field signature of the curl-free current.  If the ionospheric conductivity is uniform, the curl-free current is the Pedersen current and the divergence-free current is essentially the Hall current, which can be detected through magnetic field perturbations observed on the ground."

The NSF project will focus on interpreting meteor radar measurements performed at sites including Poker Flat, AK, Arecibo, PR, Jicamarca, Peru, and radars in Argentina, Japan and Norway. NSF will support the coordination between the laboratory results, modeling, and radar data interpretation, as well as undergraduate student participation in the laboratory measurements.<br/><br/>Layers of neutral metal atoms, such as Fe, Mg, Ca, K and Na, which peak between 85 and 95 km and are ~20 km in width, are produced by the daily ablation of Interplanetary Dust Particles. Once the meteoric metals are injected into the Earth's upper atmosphere they are responsible for a range of phenomena in addition to the formation of layers of metal atoms and ions, such as nucleation of noctilucent clouds; impacts on stratospheric aerosols and ozone chemistry; and fertilization of the ocean with bio-available iron. Current estimates for the total mass of the micrometeoroid input that is ablated in the upper atmosphere vary by two orders of magnitude. The accurate determination of the total incoming mass is relevant to determining vertical transport in the middle atmosphere and to the surface, and our understanding of dust evolution in the solar system. Radar detection of micrometeors is a widely used technique to constrain the mass input. The laboratory work undertaken by the U. of Colorado will provide much improved measurements of the key parameter needed to interpret these measurements: the ionization efficiency during the ablation process upon atmospheric entry."

Model results of near-surface weather parameters are routinely supplied to end-users either directly or with statistical post-processing. To produce more reliable numerical weather predictions, two main issues must be addressed: (i) numerical resolution and (ii) representation of the near-surface conditions that shape the local-weather. While advances in computation are enabling a better representation of real world conditions in numerical weather prediction models, representing the detailed vegetated canopy-atmosphere interactions remains a challenge. This is partially the result of canopy heterogeneities present at different scales whose variability significantly affects the near-surface region of the atmosphere. This near-surface region is host to a myriad of relevant meteorological processes such as fog, frost, dew, and turbulence in general, which if not accounted for, can distort weather forecasts. To tackle this limitation of current numerical weather prediction models, the focus of this research project is on understanding and quantifying the effect of vegetated canopy heterogeneities and developing new methodologies to properly account for them within numerical weather prediction models. This will be achieved through the synergy of wind tunnel measurements and high-resolution numerical simulations. With the acquired data, new canopy representations will be formulated that expand upon traditional relationships currently used in numerical weather prediction models such that the spatiotemporal variability of the flow in vegetated canopies can be well captured. <br/><br/><br/>This research project will improve the understanding and representation of the canopy-atmosphere interactions on a heterogeneous canopy cover. A better representation of canopies within numerical weather prediction models will lead to more accurate weather forecasts.

While general agreement exists that Monin-Obukov similarity theory is not applicable in the SBL due to the non-homogeneous and non-stationary flow, no universal organizing theory for the SBL has been presented. This poses a problem when examining aerosol movement as a function of atmospheric dynamics. It is known that stable air stratification results in katabatic downslope winds, even in very shallow topographic airsheds. These downslope winds can converge with background flow, and it is hypothesized that this convergence provides a starting point for specific events, such as internal gravity waves (IGW). Even though the stable boundary layer is normally shallow, internal gravity waves can propagate at an angle from the horizontal plane, and modify local shear, thus generating periodic turbulent mixing in space. Few studies have examined this in low relief topographic areas. This project will conduct measurements to address these open issues. The major objective of the project is to quantify the effects of shallow cold air drainage on aerosol transport and dispersion.  While the measurement campaign will result in a rich dataset, the research here will focus on answering the following questions:<br/>1.Under what mesoscale and microscale conditions (i.e. cloud cover, threshold wind speed, surface cover, stability regime, background flow, slope ratio and length, and gully volume) do converging flows exist?<br/>2.What is the spatial and temporal scale of turbulence forced oscillations and/or gravity waves generated by converging flows, and do these and do these oscillations/gravity waves follow the linear theory of IGW?<br/>3.How are aerosol dispersion and transport influenced by turbulence forced oscillations and/or gravity waves generated from a converging flow?<br/><br/>The novel aspect of this work is the ability to identify turbulent events and features with aerosol lidars to add the missing spatial component to our current understanding.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project will provide new knowledge on drainage and converging flows and their effects on aerosol transport in areas of low topographic variability. Especially of interest is how cloud cover, threshold wind speed, turbulence intermittency, topography, and stability regime affect the flows and aerosol transport.  This project will fill the significant gaps in current model parameterizations of the flows and transport in SBL. It will provide new parameterizations and modifications to extend existing to the SBL theories.  The project will also identify an empirical relationship between this resulting dispersion and the intensity of the convergence event.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Scientific broader impacts will include a rich dataset as well as empirical relationships defining when and where convergence is likely to occur. These can be adapted in forecast models that are currently missing these relationships. The larger benefits to society are to a rich field data set to researchers interested in microscale meteorological impacts on agricultural crop security and those interested in predicting impacts of hazardous releases. In addition to this intrinsic benefit of scientific enquiry, the work will also seek to expand public knowledge in understanding the nature of scientific enquiry with a specific focus on instrumentation. The project will create a series of video modules for use in undergraduate classes and public education where traditional meteorology programs are not available."

The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate the role of wildfire in decadal climate variation and prediction. On the basis of wildfire observations in the past decade, the regions that the variability of fire is large will be selected for targeted modeling analysis. The working hypotheses are that the observed fire variability is regulated by regional climate variation and that the climate feedbacks from fires increase regional climate variability. Consequently, the simulation of wildfires and their feedbacks is essential for predicting regional climate variability on a decadal scale. These hypotheses will be thoroughly tested and the mechanistic process will be carefully analyzed using an extensive suite of observations and selected ensembles of climate model simulations. In this project, the modeling capability of wildfires and their climate forcing will be developed by building a new Region-specific Fire Model with Ecosystem Feedbacks (RFMEF). Regional climate forcing by wildfires and fire feedbacks to regional climate variability will be quantified. Lastly fully interactive regional fire-climate variability feedbacks will be investigated to understand the projections of decadal regional climate variability.<br/><br/> Understanding the interannual and decadal-scale regional climate variability is critical for designing and testing (regional) adaptation and mitigation strategies. Many atmospheric, oceanic, and ecosystem factors contribute to regional climate variability and most of these factors are already captured in the earth system models. One such factor not yet well represented is wildfire. The two-way interactions between regional climate variability and wildfire not only are important in improving the decadal-scale climate model simulation and prediction but also are necessary when applying the climate model to examine adaptation strategies targeted at the vulnerability induced by enhanced climate variation (due in part to these interactions) and to investigate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies of forest management practices. The open-source RFMEF fire model that will be developed for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) system and the climate modeling data that will be generated in the project will enable policy experts to conduct more in-depth analysis of climate policies in regions strongly affected by wildfire and allow other scientists to conduct climate simulations and prediction that include the fire-ecosystem-climate interactions and that are more suitable for their research and assessment needs."

The movements of these waves, and the surface weather patterns connected to them, is driven in large measure by the mean westerly jet streams along which they propagate.  The mean jet streams are in turn strongly affected by the behavior of the waves, thus the topic of wave-mean flow interaction is essential for understanding and predicting midlatitude weather.  Classical wave-mean flow interaction theory offers powerful insights, but it is based on linear wave dynamics and thus is only formally valid for small amplitude, or infinitesimal, waves.  This is a substantial limitation given the waviness of the real-world atmosphere, and the PI has devoted considerable effort to the development of a more general theory which holds for waves of finite amplitude (see AGS-1151790 and AGS-0750916).  The present work applies this theory to several topics in atmospheric dynamics, including the 20-30 day oscillation found in the eddy kinetic energy of the Southern Hemisphere storm track (see AGS-1343080). Preliminary work suggests that the oscillation satisfy a wave action conservation relationship and the periodicity is related to wave-induced poleward surface heat flux.  Another topic is the dynamics of atmospheric blocking episodes, and a localized version of the wave-mean flow framework is developed to address this problem.  Other topics include the roles of boundary layer damping and condensational heating in wave-mean flow interaction.  The work is conducted through a combination of analysis of meteorological data (from reanalysis products) and simulations with various configurations of the Community Atmosphere Model (the atmospheric component model of the Community Earth System Model).<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts in both a scientific and societal sense, as the conceptual framework developed by the PI can be used by researchers to study a variety of phenomena related to climate variability and change.  Further downstream the improved understanding provided by the framework can benefit weather prediction on monthly to seasonal timescales and contribute to better understanding of the results of future climate projections used for decision support.  Beyond the benefits of the research itself, the project supports education through a summer school on atmospheric dynamics attended by about 30 graduate students and early career scientists.  The summer school includes a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities.   In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby training the next -generation workforce in this research area."

Wind energy has countless benefits: it is renewable and abundant, does not produce any harmful pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions, and is so technologically advanced that it is often economically competitive with other traditional energy sources. However, concerns are rising about possible undesirable effects of wind turbines in the lower boundary layer, especially on near-surface temperature. The literature is highly divided about what these effects could be. Numerical simulations have shown: warming during day and night; warming at night and cooling during the day; warming or cooling depending on atmospheric stability; cooling; and no significant effects. These contradictory findings highlight the inherent complexity of the feedbacks between wind turbines and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Only one mechanism, however, has been widely accepted (but never tested) to explain how wind turbines affect the lower boundary layer, namely that turbulence generated in wind turbine wakes enhances vertical mixing. Wakes are plume-like volumes downwind of wind turbines that are characterized by lower wind speeds and higher turbulence than the undisturbed upwind flow.  Enhanced vertical mixing would manifest as increased vertical momentum fluxes (thus increased wind shear) and increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) near the ground. The few observational campaigns that have measured changes in near-surface properties by wind turbines have been flawed or inconclusive and have not measured directly vertical momentum flux changes.  Therefore, no direct evidence of the enhanced vertical mixing mechanism is available today. In addition, enhanced vertical mixing does not explain all the observed effects.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The research hypothesis put forward in this project is that vertical mixing is generally not enhanced, but, more likely, reduced near the surface downwind of wind turbines.  The vertical wind profile is greatly altered due to the extraction of kinetic energy by wind turbines in the region around the rotor disk of diameter D spanned by the turbine blades, but the resulting wind shear near the ground is generally unaltered or reduced, not enhanced, below the rotor. Near-surface heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, and eventually temperature, are therefore generally not directly affected by wake turbulence, but rather by a combination of the reduced, not enhanced, wind shear, atmospheric stability, and undisturbed flow properties.<br/><br/>To test this hypothesis, a combined observational and numerical approach will be carried out. The measurement campaign, named VERTEX for VERTical Enhanced MiXing, will be conducted near the University of Delaware Gamesa 2-MW wind turbine in Lewes, using 12-15 surface flux towers, a 60-m meteorological towers, and 2 scanning lidars. VERTEX will quantify changes in momentum and heat fluxes, air temperature, and TKE near the ground due to the wind turbine.  The interactions between the wind turbine and the atmospheric flow will be simulated with at least two state-of-the-art numerical codes that can resolve the details of the turbulent wake down to a few meter resolution. Data from VERTEX will be used to validate the simulations. The sensitivity to a variety of inflow and atmospheric stability conditions will also be assessed.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This research will provide an understanding if and how wind turbines can alter near-surface properties in any significant way. This understanding is important because it will either enhance wind energy deployment or slow it if such changes are considered too dramatic.  Research findings will be communicated to: 1) the scientific community via participation to conferences and peer-reviewed papers; 2) the general public via targeted outreach efforts, including an exhibit at the annual University of Delaware's Coast Day and press releases; and 3) university students via a newly developed graduate and undergraduate course on ""Energy in the atmosphere""."

A physics-based understanding of the underlying cause(s) of CMEs can eventually lead to a better forecasting of space-weather events, which may allow mitigating steps to be taken to protect human and technological assets.  To model solar eruptive phenomena, it is critical to have an efficient method for numerically constructing pre-eruptive configurations from photospheric magnetic data.  The new method to be developed over the course of this project is expected to be highly competitive compared to the existing ones, such as the nonlinear force-free field reconstruction, or flux-rope insertion, especially in terms of the efficiency and control of the resulting flux-rope parameters.  This investigation is timely, feasible, and directly related to the NSF's Solar Terrestrial Research Program that ""supports research on the processes by which energy in diverse forms is generated by the Sun, transported to the Earth, and ultimately deposited in the terrestrial environment.""  Therefore, the project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.  <br/><br/>To date, analytical or semi-analytical flux-rope models are being used as the basis for the eruption in many of these models.

The near-equilibrium analytic solution will be relaxed further with line-tied MHD simulations to reach an approximate numerical stable equilibrium as the initial state for MHD simulations (with further driving) of realistic CME events.  The project will improve upon the current Titov-Demoulin (TD) force-free flux rope model the PI has developed to allow for the flexibility of complex shapes/paths of the flux rope and preserve the flux distribution in the observed magnetograms.  The computation of pre-eruptive configurations based on this technique will be simple, highly efficient, and the resulting model will be significantly more accurate than those used in CME simulations so far.  As part of this investigation, the project team will provide formulas and a numerical code for producing equilibrium flux ropes, so that other researchers from the solar-heliospheric community will be able to experiment using these models in their own codes."

The MJO is a special type of organized tropical convection systems which is distinct from others types by its vast horizontal spatial scale, subseasonal time scale, and eastward propagation over the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Enhanced or suppressed convection associated with the MJO affects global weather and climate, thereby providing a source of predictability in the subseasonal time scale. Therefore, understanding the essential dynamics and predictability of the MJO is key to improving subseasonal prediction in the tropics as well as MJO-related phenomena in the mid-latitude. The objectives of this study are to understand the predictability of the MJO and its impacts on predictability of high-impact weather events (such as extreme precipitation along the west coast). The main tasks are (i) to investigate the theoretical limit of the MJO, (ii) to investigate the physical processes for MJO propagation and the impact of the mean state change, and (iii) to examine the underlying mechanisms of the associations of MJO with extreme precipitation events. The research project will utilize satellite observations, reanalysis, and numerical experiments with a climate model.<br/><br/>Improving our understanding of subseasonal predictability will have global impacts on agriculture, commerce, healthcare, and food production. Better prediction of the MJO and related high-impact extreme precipitation events will provide policy makers, emergency managers, and other stakeholders with advanced warnings to prepare for mitigation measures.

The addition of a new junior faculty member in space sciences will allow for more regular offerings of space physics courses and the development of one or more new classes, designed to meet the needs of space physics and astrophysics graduate students, physics majors, astrophysics majors and aerospace engineering students.  In addition to enhancing the training of young researchers entering the field at this institution, this will also greatly aid the successful, high quality recruitment of the same.  The additional hire will further strengthen and grow existing partnerships with several departments and institutes and will also be encouraged to pursue new partnerships broadly with the space sciences community.  The School of Physics and Astronomy has a long history of successful outreach programs, designed to interest and excite children (and educators) about physics, to educate the public about interesting research or directly involve them in research, and to involve high school teachers and undergraduates in research.  All faculty members are expected to participate and contribute to these programs and the new faculty member will also be encouraged to develop new activities for relevant programs.   Funds are included in the budget for this.  Utilizing several established and successful departmental and institution wide programs the project will work to ensure a strong focus on increasing diversity in the recruiting both of students into the program and of the new faculty member."

AO's cornerstone research facility is a 305-meter diameter spherical reflector, located in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico. This facility has a unique cluster of instruments, making it a center of excellence with exceptional capabilities to enhance our knowledge in the Space Sciences. The observatory continues to be a magnet for Hispanic and other underrepresented groups. It has extensive educational resources for students, teachers and the public. This workshop is being hosted by the new management of AO, the University of Central Florida (UCF), with the goal of promoting innovative ideas for new research activities at AO. The workshop provides a meeting space so that key stakeholders, community scientists and local students and teachers can come together to create a shared vision of future research to be conducted at AO. It is expected to harness the expertise and forward-thinking leadership of the participants to help create tangible ways to promote cutting-edge research and involve wider participation from the scientific community. A broad range of science is carried out at AO and no single science meeting covers all of topics in one place. Therefore, this workshop was conceived to bring all stakeholders together in one place at one time. This workshop seeks to widen the AO research and science plans for the next decade or so, and the technical improvements that will be needed to guarantee the success of that research. An expected outcome is that the discussions facilitated by this workshop will help maintain AO's status as one of the premier research institutions in the world, and Puerto Rico as the location where breakthrough discoveries can and will happen in the next decade. Furthermore, white papers generated from this meeting may be used to inform Decadal Surveys being facilitated by the National Academies. <br/><br/>The following overarching question will be addressed at the workshop: What key scientific questions, emerging science opportunities, and technical advances will scientists be pursuing in the next decade? The discussion is expected to lead to the development of next-generation instruments using existing infrastructure and broaden their scope beyond traditional approaches of doing science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

REU interns will conduct research in areas of mesoscale and synoptic weather, microclimates, biometeorology, mountain meteorology, modern climate, and paleoclimate to better understand their physical processes, their predictability, and impact on society. The primary objective of the NEPARS REU site is to provide learning opportunities to a promising and diverse group of undergraduates which will help them prepare for careers in STEM fields by conducting quality scientific research, building professional networks, improving leadership skills, and developing effective communication skills.  Each year a cohort of 12 undergraduate students will be offered paid summer research positions with the NEPARS REU to work with faculty mentors from Hobart & William Smith Colleges (HWS) and Plymouth State University (PSU). Six students and three mentors will work at each research location during a 9-week summer research program. Additionally, the NEPARS REU will partner with the Mt. Washington Observatory and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at SUNY Albany to offer interactions beneficial to REU student professional development. The NEPARS REU site has a primary focus on participation of rising sophomores and rising juniors that have just completed their first and second year, respectively, at two-year or four-year colleges and universities across the U.S. offering degrees in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The REU site will be structured so that students work in pairs with a mentor.  This will allow the students to develop experience working as part of a research team, while they will also learn autonomy of research with their own individual project within the team.  Modern technology, such as video-conferencing, will be leveraged so that students can communicate across the two locations.  The REU site has 4 objectives for students: 1) interact with, learn from, and conduct research investigations with their peers and dedicated mentors through the use of REU pairings and a REU cohort across two research locations, 2) explore and discover the social, cultural, and geographic diversity of others with comparable academic interests from similar or vastly different colleges and universities, 3) cultivate a greater understanding of atmospheric and related sciences beyond the extent taught in the undergraduate classroom and lab, including the development  and enhancement of research skills while working with observational and modeling datasets, and 4) develop effective leadership and communication skills through a series of workshops and opportunities to interact with professionals within the scientific community.  Additionally the REU site has developed two objectives for the REU mentors: 1) increase interactions between two primarily undergraduate institutions to strengthen the respective programs and support new, as well as existing, faculty research collaborations, and 2) enhance faculty development as undergraduate mentors through training, faculty-to-faculty mentoring, and by working with a diverse student population from a variety of academic institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is designed by experts on the MLT and the lower atmosphere. These research communities have not worked closely together before, but a coupled approach is required to address these dynamics in a comprehensive and consistent manner. GWs strongly influence the dynamics and climate throughout the atmosphere. DEEPWAVE will provide a more complete understanding of GW generation, propagation, breakdown, and energy and momentum transport in the presence of large topography, cyclones, and strong wind shears than has been possible previously.<br/> At the core of the project is a 6-week deployment of the NSF Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft to Christchurch in June and July 2014. The GV flights will take place over mountain wave locations over and downwind of New Zealand, Tasmania, and islands in the Southern Ocean as well as the southern circumpolar jet that is an additional strong GW source. Recent satellite remote sensing has identified this region as a primary global ""hotspot"" of GWs reaching high altitudes.  Using the GV in situ instruments, dropsondes, and three new airborne remote sensing instruments, nearly the full vertical propagation path of GWs can be observed.<br/>  The GV will fly at altitudes from 9-13 km with in situ instruments observing the structure and fluxes of GWs up to ~18 km. On the GV, high-power Rayleigh and Na resonance lidars and an advanced mesospheric temperature mapper (AMTM) will map out GW structures from ~15 to 100 km. These state-of-the-art measurements will be supplemented by ground-based balloon and remote sensing instruments. <br/> This 4-year research program includes DEEPWAVE measurements in 2014, and extensive analysis efforts and associated modeling to quantify the observed dynamics thereafter.

To a large extent the specific influence of aerosol particles on climate is determined by their composition, yet much remains unknown with respect to their formation, chemical evolution and removal, especially when considering organic aerosols.  As a result, the climate forcing due to atmospheric aerosols remains highly uncertain, thus hampering current understanding and predictions of future climate change.  This CAREER award supports detailed experiments and analysis that will address fundamental questions related to gas-particle partitioning of organic compounds in atmospheric aerosols, with a particular focus on making connections between particle composition, phase and volatility. Currently, there exists a significant discrepancy between ambient and modeled organic aerosol volatility, indicating that the physical properties of the modeled aerosol are incorrect.  Absorptive partitioning theory forms the basis of most regional and global models that include organic aerosol formation, thereby determining the eventual impacts on air quality and climate.  Recent experiments suggest that absorptive partitioning theory may not be as broadly applicable as is typically assumed, perhaps because the organic aerosol exists with a glassy, as opposed to liquid-like, phase.  If correct, this finding has implications for understanding not only organic aerosol formation, but also the lifecycle of organic aerosol in the atmosphere.  The studies will address, through laboratory experiments and analysis of field data, our understanding of under what conditions partitioning theory does (or does not) work to describe the physical behavior of organic aerosols, to what extent this is determined by particle phase, and how this influences particle volatility.<br/><br/>Educational activities will include: (1) Authoring a new chapter on global climate change for the textbook Physical Geology, which is used in hundreds of introductory geoscience classrooms across the country; (2) Developing and teaching a module focused on air pollution issues in Mexico City for incorporation in an introductory-level ""place-based"" geoscience course with the objective of engaging Hispanic students, who are extremely under-represented in the geosciences.  The module will provide a new, hands-on element for the students, provide some of them with research opportunities in the principal investigator's laboratory and serve to strengthen ties between UC Davis and nearby California State University, Sacramento, which is a predominately undergraduate-serving institution.  Graduate students will be involved at all stages of the development and teaching of the module, providing them a chance to develop as educators; and (3) Organizing a multi-institution, web-based joint group meeting that involves early-career faculty members whose research focuses on atmospheric chemistry.  The primary intention of this project is to provide graduate students opportunities to more frequently engage with their peers, develop a greater sense of community as scientists and to obtain feedback from a broad spectrum of people at the ""in progress"" stage of research."

During substorms, strong currents are diverted from large radial distances in the extended tail of the magnetosphere along magnetic field lines into and through the ionosphere on the nightside.  The ionospheric segment of the current is seen as a strong auroral electrojet (AEJ) at polar latitudes.  The equatorial electrojet (EEJ), on the other hand, is generated as a result of the interaction between neutral winds flowing away from a region of strong solar heating while dragging ions across magnetic field lines, and the unique geometry of strictly horizontal magnetic field lines at the dip equator.   The association between these electrojets implies that electric fields are penetrating from the polar region as far as the dip equator during substorms. Even though weak by the time they reach the equatorial region, their signatures can be observed in the modulation of the intense equatorial electrojet.  This is a proposal to investigate more completely the response of the equatorial electrojet to substorms and determine its global closure.  The penetration of the auroral electric field to low-latitudes, and the shielding that inhibits or prevents this penetration, are open and compelling questions for understanding and more accurately predicting space weather, which ultimately has benefits to society.  Significant broader impacts include the participation of high-school teachers and students during the summer in research associated with this project.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals of this project, the proposers will address two questions: (1) how does the auroral electrojet respond to substorms, and  (2) how is the substorm-related change of the dayside EEJ connected with the nightside AEJ.<br/>They will use data from a network of ground magnetometers, which includes 7 ground stations around the dip equator and a meridional chain of stations, along with auroral images from the Polar and IMAGE satellites. To answer question 1, they will use publicly-available lists of substorms, along with these observations, to determine statistically how often the EEJ responds to substorm onsets either by intensifying or weakening, the magnetic local time dependence of the response, and whether it is changed by the preceding level of geomagnetic activity.  To answer question 2, they will examine the magnetic deflection (a measure of electric current intensity) as a function of solar zenith angle and magnetic latitude to test the idea that the EEJ and AEJ are connected by meridional currents that flow around the terminator.  This is a new idea and a unique aspect of this proposal."

These events are believed to be generated by deep convective processes within thunderstorm systems that launch gravity wave structures into the upper atmosphere region of 60 to 100 km where strong viscous dissipation of these wave packets occurs. Part of the wave energy of these primary waves is transformed into the production of secondary waves that are able to propagate higher into the region of atmospheric heights above 200 km. Here, the interaction of these waves with the ionospheric plasma (pushing or pulling plasma along magnetic field lines) would then generate structures called Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (TIDs) that are so often seen in TEC data.  The primary objective of the research is to compare the observed concentric TEC perturbations with those calculated from realistic modeling of the primary and secondary GWs from deep convection in order to strengthen and validate the models for the calculation of these TID structures.  A secondary objective would be to utilize the amplitudes and scales of the observed secondary GWs to probe the dynamics of the 'dark' (but highly variable) region near 125-225 km where most of the primary GWs dissipate.  A satisfactory explanation of these TID events in terms of gravity wave processes by reference to the successful modeling of the formation of these structures has never been achieved. Thus, the funded research has a significant potential for providing an enhanced understanding of the properties of these circular TID events that relate to the heating and cooling processes associated with the dissipation and transformation of the primary wave structure into the secondary wave output.<br/> <br/>Significant societal impact and transformative research outcomes for this award are expected to be achieved as a result of the success in modeling these circular TID events. Because GWs cause scintillation and plasma bubbles that can disrupt satellite communication and GPS signals, this study may lead to better predictions for the occurrence of these phenomena, which is nationally relevant. In order to enhance scientific understanding for the general public, the researcher will disseminate broadly the results via a web site, conference talks, and journal publications.

The anticipated improvement in our understanding of the thunderstorm driver component is also critical to achieving progress on understanding other global electric circuit variations such as from solar wind effects, solar protons events, or large scale atmospheric temperature change. If a robust relation between global thunderstorm activity and stratospheric vertical current density is identified as expected from the grant, this would open the possibility to the prospects of being able to monitor total global thunderstorm activity using a small number of instrumented balloons."

Electric fields, produced by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the onrushing solar wind ultimately are responsible for the auroral oval but they also cause high-energy electrons and ions to drift deep into the inner magnetosphere.  The inner magnetosphere maps along magnetic field lines into the midlatitude ionosphere causing disturbances there.  On the dusk side of the inner magnetosphere, the ions penetrate closer to the Earth (and thus to lower latitudes) than the electrons. The weak magnetic field-aligned currents associated with ion pressure gradients at high altitude in space surrounding the Earth close through the low-density sub-auroral ionosphere on the dusk side and in the process produce strong westward electric fields that set the subauroral ionospheric plasma in motion.  The electric fields and the drifts they produce in the ionosphere are called subauroral polarization streams (SAPS).  The resulting strong ionospheric electric fields map back out along magnetic field lines producing effects in the magnetosphere.  This coupling is important in producing space weather disturbances. The proposal will develop an empirical model based on a suite of low-earth orbiting satellites that describes the global distribution of SAPS fields in the ionosphere as a function of solar and geophysical conditions.  An important aspect of this work is an investigation of the feedback between the electrical conductance of the ionosphere and the SAPS evolution.  The results will contribute to our ability to understand and predict the temporal evolution of space weather disturbances and their impacts on vulnerable technologies.  Of particular importance, SAPS draw dense plasma from the dayside ionosphere in plumes up over the polar cap, which can disrupt GPS signals resulting in large errors in global positioning.  A graduate student will be trained on the project at the University of Texas.<br/><br/>The proposers will use 80 years of ionospheric observations covering different local time sectors taken by satellites in the Defense Meteorological Satellite, Dynamics Explorer, and Atmosphere Explorer Programs.  These will be sorted by solar activity and geophysical parameters to construct the first empirical model of subauroral electric fields.   The data will also be used in a superposed epoch analysis of magnetic storms to understand the evolution of the SAPS electric fields during different stages of the storm.   The RCM-E model, which combines the Rice Convection Model (RCM) with an equilibrium (self-consistent) magnetic field model (E), is a physics-based model that will be used to explore the evolution of the SAPS and test how ionospheric conductance affects this evolution. Given the plasma distribution for each species along with the magnetic field and electric potential at the outer boundary of the inner magnetosphere at high altitude, and the electric conductance pattern in the ionosphere, RCM solves for the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An important new aspect of this work is the focus on the effects of ion-neutral coupling through the changes it produces in the imposed ionospheric conductance pattern (i.e., progressive decrease in subauroral density as the storm progresses)."

In the absence of convection the cooling effect of longwave radiation produces a vertical temperature profile which is unstable.  The instability leads to convection, which transports sensible and latent heat upward and counteracts the longwave cooling, restabilizing the atmosphere.  This cooperative interaction between radiative cooling and convective heat transport leads to a state known as radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), which provides a basic explanation for the dependence of air temperature on altitude.  RCE is also fundamental to our understanding of the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration (referred to as climate sensitivity), the response of the hydrological cycle to changes in global temperature, and the development of large-scale atmospheric circulation.<br/><br/>Early simulations of RCE used highly simplified approximations which only captured the bulk effects of convection, but RCE simulations are now performed with more sophisticated models that represent individual convective clouds and their interactions with the surrounding air.  Results of such simulations by the PIs and others suggest that the tendency of convective clouds to aggregate into clusters increases with increasing temperature.  The temperature dependence of convective aggregation could matter for climate sensitivity, as aggregated clouds are concentrated in relatively small regions, leaving clear skies over a larger portion of the earth than disaggregated convection.  Cooling to space is more effective under clear skies, thus an increase in clear sky area due to enhanced aggregation constitutes a negative feedback, counteracting some of the warming that produced increased aggregation.  <br/><br/>The possibility of a negative feedback due to convective aggregation has clear implications for understanding climate change and its potential societal impacts.  But the mechanisms of convective aggregation and its temperature dependence, and the extent to which aggregation affects climate sensitivity are not clear.

This research project will take advantage of a newly developed network of rain sensors to conduct a multitude of studies on rainfall characteristics.  The main societal impacts fall under the umbrella of public safety and productivity.

The team will perform structural and statistical exploration of rain by collecting and analyzing time series rain observations over a newly configured network that consists of two 2D video disdrometers (2DVD), six 1D optical disdrometers (1DVD), and 21 Laser Precipitation Monitors (LPM).  The objectives to be addressed during the work period include:  exploring the frequency of the statistical heterogeneity of rain in a wider variety of meteorological conditions,  comparing 2DVD observations to those interpolated over a small network of LPMs, characterizing the 1DVD estimates with those of different neighboring instruments, using 2DVD data to detect structures having scales relevant to radar Bragg scatter from precipitation, expanding our understanding of the scaling of DSD and their integrated parameters in statistically homogeneous conditions and in a variety of different meteorological conditions, beginning preliminary observations of the effect of measurements at different heights above ground, and combining 2DVD observations from two instruments for unique simultaneity studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the absence of convection the cooling effect of longwave radiation produces a vertical temperature profile which is unstable.  The instability leads to convection, which transports sensible and latent heat upward and counteracts the longwave cooling, restabilizing the atmosphere.  This cooperative interaction between radiative cooling and convective heat transport leads to a state known as radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), which provides a basic explanation for the dependence of air temperature on altitude.  RCE is also fundamental to our understanding of the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration (referred to as climate sensitivity), the response of the hydrological cycle to changes in global temperature, and the development of large-scale atmospheric circulation.<br/><br/>Early simulations of RCE used highly simplified approximations which only captured the bulk effects of convection, but RCE simulations are now performed with more sophisticated models that represent individual convective clouds and their interactions with the surrounding air.  Results of such simulations by the PIs and others suggest that the tendency of convective clouds to aggregate into clusters increases with increasing temperature.  The temperature dependence of convective aggregation could matter for climate sensitivity, as aggregated clouds are concentrated in relatively small regions, leaving clear skies over a larger portion of the earth than disaggregated convection.  Cooling to space is more effective under clear skies, thus an increase in clear sky area due to enhanced aggregation constitutes a negative feedback, counteracting some of the warming that produced increased aggregation.  <br/><br/>The possibility of a negative feedback due to convective aggregation has clear implications for understanding climate change and its potential societal impacts.  But the mechanisms of convective aggregation and its temperature dependence, and the extent to which aggregation affects climate sensitivity are not clear.  A further consideration is that the extent of aggregation and its temperature dependence may not be consistent from one model to another, and the PIs have worked to organize an international RCE model intercomparison project (RCEMIP) to address the issue of model dependence.<br/><br/>Here the PIs use simulations from RCEMIP to explore the physics and dynamics of aggregation and its temperature dependence using a variety of diagnostics to test hypotheses taken from their own prior work and from their collaborators.

In the Northern Hemisphere, storm tracks span the North Pacific and North Atlantic, and the storms in them shape the regional weather, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, the eastern United States, and Europe. Because storm tracks are the principal conduit through which energy and moisture are transported in the climate system, they are also crucially important for controlling climatic features such as the global distributions of rainfall and surface temperature. Recent observations and simulations with numerical atmosphere models have revealed that climate changes modulate various aspects of storm tracks. For example, storm tracks generally shift poleward as the climate warms and equatorward as the climate cools. However, fundamental questions about the structure and variability of storm tracks and their response to climate changes remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear what controls where storm tracks terminate over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, what their observed low-frequency variations depend on, and how these and other aspects respond to climate changes. Answering such questions requires an improved understanding of how storm tracks interact with stationary weather patterns, such as the Aleutian Low, and how they interact with clouds which on one hand are products of storms and on the other hand modify, through their absorption/reflections/emission, the environments where storm tracks operate. <br/><br/>This project aims to answer such questions, using observational data and targeted experiments with idealized atmosphere models that serve as a computational laboratory. The project will examine the processes responsible for controlling storm tracks by analyzing observations and simulations with an atmosphere model that is simplified in some respects (e.g., it may simplify or eliminate continental effects altogether) but contains relatively sophisticated representations of clouds. The goal is study the fundamental processes controlling the structure and variability of storm tracks and their interactions clouds, culminating in theories and conceptual models of storm track dynamics.  <br/><br/>This research will bridge the gap between state-of-the-art comprehensive climate models and fundamental physical understanding. The conceptual models to be developed under this project will provide a framework for assessing weather forecasting and climate models and will suggest ways for improving them. The project will assess and potentially enhance predictability of major weather hazards in mid-latitudes, including extreme storms, droughts, and floods, on sub-seasonal and longer timescales. It will also train a new generation of scientists who are fluent in the use of the full breadth of state-of-the-art tools in atmosphere and climate dynamics, from theory to comprehensive numerical models. This will be achieved by directly funding a postdoctoral scholar, who, by the end of this project, will be ready to commence her independent career in climate and large-scale dynamics; by partially funding a graduate student at the start of his or her research career; and by disseminating results through publications, conference presentations, colloquia, and classroom teaching.

This study will provide detailed knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of vorticity sources, sinks and fluxes within severe storms.  The application of prior transformative research by Rotunno (1988) to determine a ""balance"" between inflow and outflow in the vicinity of the mesocyclone is potentially groundbreaking, by providing a framework for determining an ideal balance relationship for radial mass flux (inflow vs. outflow), especially at low levels.

The upcoming AIR-Spec experiment will exercise a different capability of the NCAR's GV aircraft.  Namely, the IR transmissive window will be mounted on a side portal adjacent to the optical bench.  In doing so, the project team will demonstrate the flexibility of the design, simplify the operations and verify their ability to observe eclipses anywhere in the world.  Developing the ability for coordinated observations of the Sun's corona with the future DKIST will be greatly beneficial for the calibration of DKIST observations, and it will motivate future solar instrumentation.

Despite the importance of the secondary eyewall, competing theories exist regarding how they develop and their interactions with hurricane rainbands.  This project will use a combination of observations from hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and the latest in numerical modeling to fill a critical gap in scientific understanding of tropical cyclone evolution.  The main societal impact from the award would be through improved tropical cyclone forecasts, especially in the crucial hours before landfall.  The project will also help to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research team plans to study the dynamics behind the transition of tropical cyclone inner core rainbands into a secondary eyewall.  The researchers contend that current theories for secondary eyewall formation (SEF) do not explain the exact dynamical pathway that connects rainbands to SEF.  To make progress on this topic, the team will combine observational analysis and numerical modeling.  The observational analysis will include data from a total of 38 SEF events that were well sampled by the NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft over the past two decades.  The modeling aspect will focus on more recent events, such as Harvey, Irma, and Maria, making use of the Penn State Weather Research Forecasting - Ensemble Kalman Filter (WRF-EnKF) system.  The main objectives of the project are to:   (1) Identify and characterize coherent rainband features that occurred in observations prior to secondary eyewall formation and compare to those rainbands in storms that did not develop secondary eyewalls, (2) Examine the rainband features leading to secondary eyewall formation in real-case model simulations and compare to those in observations, (3) Explore the ubiquity and predictability of rainband dynamics that lead to secondary eyewalls through systematic ensemble sensitivity experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new High Frequency (HF) heating facility with the ISR (Incoherent Scatter Radar) and other instruments provides a unique opportunity to study heating-related aeronomic and plasma physics problems. This includes the rapidly-imaged observation of airglow at 557.7 nm, 630.0 nm and 427.8 nm during ionospheric ""heating"" campaigns to understand the role of HF-heating in generating plasma bubbles, or modulating them if already present, and to understand the role of secondary suprathermal electrons in producing airglow at different wavelengths.  This research will also yield insight to the heating process, including locating ionospheric ""hot-spots"", yielding details of the electron collision process, elucidating the role of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the strongly heated regions, and study of heating effects in Sporadic E. The latter study will include Ca+ metal-lidar observations as further defined by 555.7 nm imaging as well as ISR and HF radar results. HF heating of the ionosphere offers a unique opportunity to investigate the plasma heating process and its effects on the neutrals in a controlled (experimental) fashion. Outside of the heating campaigns, a database of 630 nm all-sky camera images from other locations will be assembled collaboratively to investigate the global context of the omnipresent ~1 hr period ionospheric waves, and associated dynamics, first identified with the AO ISR. This work will utilize other AO instruments, including the resonance and Rayleigh lidars, to investigate the role of wave coupling from lower atmospheric regions. Also, a proposed new CCD camera will allow high speed imaging to better understand HF heating effects and linking optical and radar meteors to study meteoroid aeronomy. The response of the SAIR to sudden changes in the environment caused by heating will be explored with the collaborative use of multiple instruments, thus informing numerous geophysical research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of this work will help to establish collaborations with plasma physicists, modelers, and space weather scientists. It will also advance the AO cluster capabilities with the addition of a User-Owned, Public Access (UOPA) high frame rate CCD to the current imager and help in establishing international collaborations. Students representing minorities from local universities in Puerto Rico will be encouraged to participate in observations and data analysis. They will be involved in the improvements of the optical systems including training on AO instrumentation and the application of these instruments to study aeronomy of the SAIR."

In particular, climate model simulations suggest that the westerly jet streams found at upper levels in the middle latitudes will shift towards the poles, so that the mean Northern Hemisphere jet stream will migrate northward, with a corresponding southward shift for its the Southern Hemisphere counterpart.  These shifts are small but consequential, as patterns of rainfall and storminess in the middle latitudes are determined in large part by the positions of the jet streams.  <br/><br/>The poleward shift of jet streams as a consequence of greenhouse warming is a robust feature of global warming simulations and has been a research topic since at least 2005, but the seasonality and geography of the response has not yet been fully explored.  Preliminary work for this project shows that in the Southern Hemisphere the largest shift is in the Fall (March to May), followed by Summer (December to February), Winter (June to August), and Spring (September to November). In the North Atlantic the order is, from largest to smallest, Fall (September to November), Summer (June to August), Spring (March to May), and Winter (December to February). The ordering is again different in the North Pacific, with Fall leading by a large margin followed by Winter, Spring, and Summer. By now several theories have been proposed to explain why the jets shift poleward in an year-round, longitudinally averaged sense, but none of these theories provides a clear intuition for the seasonality (i.e. why the shift is largest in Fall) or the regional variations. <br/><br/>Research under this award consists of analysis of observational data from reanalysis products and simulations of future climate from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and the Large Ensemble archive of simulations using the Community Earth System Model.  This analysis is followed by numerical experiments using models of varying levels of complexity, intended to isolate and study possibly physical mechanisms leading seasonally and geographically varying jet shifts.  One issue to be considered is that the pattern of greenhouse warming generally includes a deep tropospheric warming maximum in the tropics together with surface trapped warming near the poles (referred to as polar amplification). The jet shifts can be regarded as a combined response to the tropical and polar influences, which are likely to have opposing effects and very different seasonalities.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest due to the strong impacts of jet shifts on local climate, for instance a northward shift of jet streams could cause drying in the region downwind of the present-day jet location accompanied by excessive rain and snow to the north.  In addition, the project will support and train two students, thereby contributing to the future workforce in this research area. The PI and her students will also organize a special session at an annual geosciences meeting to publicize results of the study and encourage further investigation of the topic."

These events have worldwide consequences from disruptions in tropical monsoons to changes in the severity of winter weather over the United States and Canada.  The interplay of ocean currents, surface winds, and precipitation leading to ENSO events has been intensively studied, and the underlying dynamical mechanisms have been identified. But important questions remain, particularly regarding event-to-event differences in ENSO behavior that compromise prediction efforts. The term ""ENSO complexity"" has been coined to refer to differences commonly observed between individual events.  Past work on the topic has emphasized differences in the SST pattern at the peak of the ENSO event, in particular the location of the maximum SST anomaly in either the CP or EP.  Work here complements this analysis by looking at systematic differences in event transition, seeking  to explain why some warm events are immediately followed by cold events and vice versa while others, particularly cold events, linger for multiple years.<br/><br/>Preliminary research by the Principal Investigator (PI) identifies distinct onset mechanisms for ENSO oscillation between warm and cold events and for persistent events of the same sign.  In the charge-discharge (CD) mechanism, warm water accumulates in the upper ocean over the equatorial Pacific prior to the onset of a warm event and is subsequently discharged to higher latitudes.  This mechanism leads to oscillations in which warm events are followed directly by cold events. In the seasonal footprinting (SF) mechanism, wintertime weather anomalies in the middle latitudes cause ocean temperature changes which in turn produce changes in the surface winds.  The surface wind changes propagate into the tropical Pacific and result in ENSO events, and the PI's work links this mechanism to multi-year cold events.  Further work suggests that changes in ENSO behavior since 1980 are associated with enhancement of the SF mechanism, and that climate models overrepresent the CD mechanism and thus produce ENSO events which are too regular.<br/><br/>This project will address five related goals: 1) understanding the combined effects on ENSO complexity of the CD and SF onset mechanisms and subsequent ENSO evolution; 2) understanding the cause of the asymmetry between the positive and negative phases of the SF mechanism; 3) understanding the mean state sensitivity and slow variations in the CD and SF mechanisms; 4) using ENSO complexity dynamics to understand future ENSO projections and to develop new metrics for model intercomparisons; and 5) using ENSO complexity dynamics to understand ENSO activity in paleoclimate datasets.  The work is performed through analysis of observational datasets and simulations using climate models in a variety of configurations. Work addressing goal 5 uses data from the Last Millennium Reanalysis to examine differences in ENSO complexity between the Medieval Climate Anomaly of the period 950 to 1250 and the Little Ice Age period (1300 to 1850).<br/><br/>This research has societal relevance due to the worldwide impacts of ENSO events and the desirability of skillful forecasts of them to allow for appropriate preparations.  The work is directly relevant to forecasting given the focus on warm-to-cold transition versus multi-year persistence, a central challenge of ENSO prediction.  The finding that the SF mechanism has become more prominent in recent decades also has implications for anticipating future changes in ENSO behavior.   The project would support and train a postdoctoral researcher as well as a graduate student and a graduate student, thus providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It affects weather conditions worldwide including atmospheric rivers and flooding in California and hurricane formation in the Gulf of Mexico.  Some MJO events appear to form independently and are designated as ""primary"" events.  Other ""secondary"" events appear to be triggered by wave disturbances in the upper troposphere which propagate into the Indian Ocean from regions to the west, in the subtropical belts of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  The triggering of MJO events by upstream wave disturbances has been well documented, but the processes through which the waves induce MJO events are not well known, and this project seeks to better understand them.  Preliminary work by the PI suggests that the precursor waves are not fast moving triggers that impulsively kick-start the MJO, but slowly propagating Rossby waves with intraseasonal timescales.  One possibility is that a secondary MJO events can be promoted by an earlier MJO event, which generates Rossby waves in the central equatorial Pacific which propagate eastward and toward higher latitudes, later recurving back into the tropics where they arrive over the equatorial Indian Ocean to induce the subsequent MJO.  The project has a focus on Africa because the precursor waves enter the Indian Ocean from the African subtropics.  A variety of statistical methods are used to detect and characterize the precursor waves, which are identified in observational data from satellites as well as reanalysis products.  Moisture and momentum budgets are then used to understand how the waves contribute to the formation of secondary MJO events.<br/><br/>The work has societal broader impacts due to the variety of weather impacts associated with the MJO.  There is some skill in forecasts of the propagation of MJO events, but predictions of the initiation of MJO events would allow greater lead times for prediction of MJO impacts.  As the project focuses on precursor meteorology over Africa, the project may also have benefit for understanding and predicting African weather.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students, thereby building the future workforce in this research area."

Thus, the main goal of the project is to provide an improved understanding of MHD turbulence, in general, seeding the future application of the project results to other space plasmas.  The project will support an undergraduate student at the UNH, and it will promote strong international collaborations for the benefit of advancing space weather research both in the USA and worldwide.<br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at continuing the productive and successful research of the project team on the third-moment theory of the turbulence.  The third-moment theory of the turbulence in the solar wind provides a tool, which is highly model-independent and can serve as benchmark for modelers.  The investigators will continue to expand their research in this area by including wind tunnel data, the anisotropy of the energy-cascade, turbulence between 0.3 and 1 AU, intermittent structures, shear flows, turbulence in downstream shock regions, and expansion effects.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the nature of turbulence in space and astrophysical plasmas.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.

While general agreement exists that Monin-Obukov similarity theory is not applicable in the SBL due to the non-homogeneous and non-stationary flow, no universal organizing theory for the SBL has been presented. This poses a problem when examining aerosol movement as a function of atmospheric dynamics. It is known that stable air stratification results in katabatic downslope winds, even in very shallow topographic airsheds. These downslope winds can converge with background flow, and it is hypothesized that this convergence provides a starting point for specific events, such as internal gravity waves (IGW). Even though the stable boundary layer is normally shallow, internal gravity waves can propagate at an angle from the horizontal plane, and modify local shear, thus generating periodic turbulent mixing in space. Few studies have examined this in low relief topographic areas. This project will conduct measurements to address these open issues. The major objective of the project is to quantify the effects of shallow cold air drainage on aerosol transport and dispersion.  While the measurement campaign will result in a rich dataset, the research here will focus on answering the following questions:<br/>1.Under what mesoscale and microscale conditions (i.e. cloud cover, threshold wind speed, surface cover, stability regime, background flow, slope ratio and length, and gully volume) do converging flows exist?<br/>2.What is the spatial and temporal scale of turbulence forced oscillations and/or gravity waves generated by converging flows, and do these and do these oscillations/gravity waves follow the linear theory of IGW?<br/>3.How are aerosol dispersion and transport influenced by turbulence forced oscillations and/or gravity waves generated from a converging flow?<br/><br/>The novel aspect of this work is the ability to identify turbulent events and features with aerosol lidars to add the missing spatial component to our current understanding.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project will provide new knowledge on drainage and converging flows and their effects on aerosol transport in areas of low topographic variability. Especially of interest is how cloud cover, threshold wind speed, turbulence intermittency, topography, and stability regime affect the flows and aerosol transport.  This project will fill the significant gaps in current model parameterizations of the flows and transport in SBL. It will provide new parameterizations and modifications to extend existing to the SBL theories.  The project will also identify an empirical relationship between this resulting dispersion and the intensity of the convergence event.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Scientific broader impacts will include a rich dataset as well as empirical relationships defining when and where convergence is likely to occur. These can be adapted in forecast models that are currently missing these relationships. The larger benefits to society are to a rich field data set to researchers interested in microscale meteorological impacts on agricultural crop security and those interested in predicting impacts of hazardous releases. In addition to this intrinsic benefit of scientific enquiry, the work will also seek to expand public knowledge in understanding the nature of scientific enquiry with a specific focus on instrumentation. The project will create a series of video modules for use in undergraduate classes and public education where traditional meteorology programs are not available."

Efforts to maintain safe ozone levels by limiting production are complicated by the presence of ozone from sources other than local human activity, as higher levels of this ""background"" ozone necessitate more stringent production caps.  The background concentration poses a challenge for air quality management as background levels vary from place to place and also change over time.  Thus the need to manage and mitigate ground-level ozone motivates research on the behavior of the background and the fundamental processes that govern its variability in time and space.<br/><br/>A significant portion of the background ozone comes from the stratosphere, where ozone is produced naturally by ultraviolet sunlight and can be transported over great distances.  The stratosphere extends upward from roughly the flight level of long-distance air travel and is thus well separated from ground-level ozone production and impacts.  But ozone-rich air can descend into the troposphere during stratospheric intrusions, which occur as a result of Rossby wave breaking.  In this process the large-scale flow becomes strongly sheared and stratospheric air forms filaments which extend and fold into the troposphere and mix with ambient air. The stratospheric contribution implies that the ozone background can be influenced by several forms of atmospheric and climate variability that are known to affect the stratosphere, including El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO).<br/><br/>Research performed here seeks to understand the processes which control the location and amount of stratospheric ozone entering the troposphere over North America.  Two factors are considered, the first of which is the amount of ozone present in the lowest layer of the stratosphere where it can be mixed into the troposphere by intrusions.  The amount of ozone in this reservoir is controlled by processes including the equator-to-pole overturning circulation of the stratosphere which can potentially be influenced by ENSO, NAM, and QBO variability.  The second factor is north-south shifts of the North Pacific jet stream and accompanying storm track, which modulate the frequency and location of Rossby wave breaking events that produce intrusions over western North America. Such jet shifts are known to occur as a consequence of ENSO and NAM variability. The research is conducted through a combination of observational analysis, working from satellite data and reanalysis products, and computer simulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM, developed as part of the Community Earth System Model).<br/><br/>As noted above, the work has broader impacts due to the need to inform mitigation actions to address the health impacts of ground-level ozone pollution.  In addition to pollution concerns the work has relevance to several forms of surface weather that are affected by stratospheric intrusions.  In particular, deep intrusions can modulate thunderstorm activity and increase surface winds leading to enhanced wildfire occurrence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events are believed to be generated by deep convective processes within thunderstorm systems that launch gravity wave structures into the upper atmosphere region of 60 to 100 km where strong viscous dissipation of these wave packets occurs. Part of the wave energy of these primary waves is transformed into the production of secondary waves that are able to propagate higher into the region of atmospheric heights above 200 km. Here, the interaction of these waves with the ionospheric plasma (pushing or pulling plasma along magnetic field lines) would then generate structures called Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (TIDs) that are so often seen in TEC data.  The primary objective of the research is to compare the observed concentric TEC perturbations with those calculated from realistic modeling of the primary and secondary GWs from deep convection in order to strengthen and validate the models for the calculation of these TID structures.  A secondary objective would be to utilize the amplitudes and scales of the observed secondary GWs to probe the dynamics of the 'dark' (but highly variable) region near 125-225 km where most of the primary GWs dissipate.  A satisfactory explanation of these TID events in terms of gravity wave processes by reference to the successful modeling of the formation of these structures has never been achieved. Thus, the funded research has a significant potential for providing an enhanced understanding of the properties of these circular TID events that relate to the heating and cooling processes associated with the dissipation and transformation of the primary wave structure into the secondary wave output.<br/> <br/>Significant societal impact and transformative research outcomes for this award are expected to be achieved as a result of the success in modeling these circular TID events. Because GWs cause scintillation and plasma bubbles that can disrupt satellite communication and GPS signals, this study may lead to better predictions for the occurrence of these phenomena, which is nationally relevant. In order to enhance scientific understanding for the general public, the researcher will disseminate broadly the results via a web site, conference talks, and journal publications.

EWs are important weather makers in much of the tropics and play a critical role in hurricane development.  Much of the research has focused on African EWs, which along the easterly jet over the Sahel and propagate westward over the North Atlantic.  The genesis of these waves is often explained in terms of jet instabilities particular to the easterly jet, yet similar EWs are found in the tropical eastern Pacific where the large-scale flow characteristics are very different.  One explanation for the presence of EWs in the eastern equatorial Pacific is that they originated as African EWs, formed through processes associated with the African easterly jet, and subsequently propagated across the Atlantic and the Caribbean to reach the eastern Pacific.  While there is some evidence to support this theory, previous work by the PI (see AGS-1347738) suggests that EWs can form in the tropical eastern Pacific despite the clear differences between this region and the Sahel.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that east Pacific EWs are largely caused by upscale growth of topographically-generated disturbances downwind of the mountain ranges of Central America. Numerical simulation by the PI have shown that EW activity is dramatically reduced when the Central American topography is flattened, but these simulations were crude as the removal of topography has a variety of dramatic effects on the meteorology of the region including mean flow, cloudiness and precipitation.  Simulations to be performed here would use a ""nudging"" technique to constrain the background flow despite modifications to topography and other factors so that a more focused study of wave generation by specific forcing mechanisms can be performed in a realistic setting.  The work would use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in a convection-permitting configuration.  The work would also address the modulation of EWs by intraseasonal oscillations of the background flow.  Additional work uses diagnostic techniques including vorticity and energy budgets to study EW generation and propagation in observational data.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance due to the key role of EWs in tropical meteorology and hurricane genesis.  If EWs found in the eastern Pacific originated in the African easterly jet they may be more predictable than if they are generated locally by Central American topography, thus the results of this work have potential implications for operational forecasting.  The modulation of EW activity by intraseasonal oscillations is also of practical interest given the long lead times of intraseasonal oscillations.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

High-power, high-frequency (HF) radio wave transmitters are an important tool for the experimental investigation of fundamental plasma physics in the terrestrial ionosphere.  Three HF heating facilities (HAARP, EISCAT, and Arecibo Observatory) have demonstrated the ability to induce overhead plasma densities approaching those created by solar photoionization, thereby enabling empirical studies of energetic electron production, acceleration and transport.  Despite numerous experiments over the past several decades, however, the physical mechanisms responsible for electron acceleration during ionospheric modification remain unsettled.  In order to tackle this problem, this project adopts a novel approach that involves the combination of plasma-line and ion-line detection by the Arecibo Observatory incoherent scatter radar (ISR).  This is the most sensitive instrument of its kind, together with passive measurement of optical airglow emitted by Oxygen atoms at 844.6 nm and 630.0 nm.  The research campaign will utilize nearly all of the facility and the PI-owned optical instrumentation on site at the Arecibo Observatory and at the nearby Culebra island in an unprecedentedly coordinated effort.  Unlike past investigations of electron acceleration during ionospheric modification, the research analysis during this project will incorporate coincident empirical estimates of thermospheric Oxygen density, which the PI will derive from calibrated measurements of the Oxygen 844.6 nm emission line brightness.

Although advancing ionospheric plasma physics is the primary focus of the effort, the careful experimental design by the PI will also yield crucial constraints on the rate of Oxygen 844.6 nm emission line excitation via O+ radiative recombination.  Moreover, the intended implementation of astronomical calibration at this near-infrared wavelength as well as at the Oxygen 630.0 nm emission line will provide a long-awaited means of cross-calibrating the facility calibration sources for future campaigns.  Finally, the new Oxygen 844.6 nm emission line photometer can easily be configured to conduct routine passive measurements for community use.  Even in the absence of HF ionospheric heating, the calibrated Oxygen 844.6 nm emission line data provide a means for Thermospheric Oxygen sensing.  This capability, which currently is not possible at any other ISR facility, enables crucial investigations of ion-neutral coupling which are needed to advance physics-based models of the upper atmosphere.  ."

A particular focus in this regard will be determining how the negative breakdown of intracloud (IC) and negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) flashes develops subsequent to initiation.<br/><br/>Another focus will be to home in on the source and cause of highly energetic terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs). TGFs are increasingly being shown to occur during the initial stages on IC and -CG flashes. This has been further demonstrated by ongoing LMA and electric field change observations at the University of Utah's cosmic ray-detecting Telescope Array (TA), which has detected several possible downward TGFs. Additional studies, in this case utilizing the broadband interferometer, are to be obtained at the newly-established High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray observatory, situated at 4 km altitude in southeastern Mexico. Different discharge processes and lightning types, such as precursor, screening, anomalous polarity, and lull discharges will be conducted.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The GLM validation studies will valuably assist in understanding and interpreting the upcoming GLM observations, which will quickly become a major part of nowcasting in National Weather Service operations. The voluminous, state-of-the-art INTF and LMA data obtained from the KSC study will be archived at KSC and made available online for analysis by investigators and students at other institutions.  As part of the GLM validation study, the Washington DC and Wallops VA LMA networks will be joined together and expanded northward to provide detailed lightning coverage over a large extent of the east coast region. Ongoing analysis of the Sakurajima volcano will be providing insights into the electrification processes of volcanic eruptions. Finally, development and dissemination of lightning mapping and related technology to other research communities and operational users will be continued."

The basic characteristics of tropical waves, including their size, shape and frequency, can be derived by solving an idealized model of their fundamental dynamics.  The resulting solutions are expressed in terms of sinusoidal waves, with successive ridges and troughs repeating uniformly around the equator.  Analysis methods that assume such extended wave trains can detect equatorial waves, and these methods confirm that observed waves largely match theoretical predictions.  But observed waves typically span a limited region and it can be desirable to study them using methods which make no assumptions regarding their global nature or longitudinal extent.<br/><br/>In this project tropical waves are identified and studied using the Multi-dimensional Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD), a time series analysis method pioneered by the PI and others (see AGS-1139479).  MEEMD is used to identify variability at each longitude along the equator at frequencies roughly corresponding to frequencies for particular waves. Additional information about the expected latitudinal shape of the waves is used to separate wave types which have similar frequencies.  Once the waves are identified in the data their behavior is further analyzed using techniques to determine characteristics such as equivalent depth, a measure of the depth of wave motions that can be related to the generation of waves by condensational heating in clouds.  The MEEMD technique has some advantages for representing the interaction of waves of different frequencies, and the MEEMD technique has been used to develop holo-spectral analysis, a method for quantifying wave interactions and studying their energetics.  One application of holo-spectral analysis here is to examine the modulation of equatorial waves by the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a much larger form of tropical variability which fluctuates slowly over the course of a month or two.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the importance of equatorial waves for the weather and climate of the tropics, as noted above.  The MEEMD and holo-spectral analysis tools developed in the project will be made available to the research community to ensure the scientific broader impacts of the project.  These tools have applicability in a variety of research fields beyond tropical meteorology, for example in the study of brain wave anomalies in neural disorders.  In addition, the project would provide support and training for a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby promoting the next generation of scientists in this  research area."

During periods of significant space weather the circulation of plasma in the upper atmosphere can be dramatically changed, resulting in high density regions flowing over the polar cap that can lead to enhanced outflow of plasma flowing out along magnetic field lines into outer space.  These changes can impact radio communications through the ionosphere and may cause significant errors in positions derived from satellite based navigation systems.  The investigators will address this important topic through the development of a numerical model.  This model will be able to address how the outflow plasma relates to these density enhancements.  Success in modeling these interactions could potentially lead to improved numerical models for forecasting space weather.  In addition, this investigation will support training of a graduate student in computer programming and data analysis techniques. <br/><br/>A major focus of this investigation will be simulation studies of plasma redistribution associated with the storm enhanced density (SED) and its possible counterpart plasmaspheric plume, polar cap tongues and patches, and enhanced ion outflow associated with such plasma redistribution during geomagnetic active times.

Regions with bimodal rainy seasons, with precipitation maxima and agricultural growing seasons in the spring and fall, occur generally within about 7 degrees of the equator in Kenya, southern Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Tanzania. This rainfall distribution is traditionally explained as being related to having two overhead passes of the sun each year.  However, this explanation is not complete since regions 10 or 15 degrees from the equator have one rainy season each year despite two overhead passes of the sun at these latitudes. In addition, equatorial central and western Africa experience humid climate with rainfall throughout the year.  This suggests that a more complete understanding of the seasonality of East African rainfall should consider such factors as the roles of the Indian Ocean, topography, and near-equator atmospheric dynamics (with a small or absent Coriolis force) in addition to the solar forcing. This research project is aimed at advancing our understanding of how the seasonality of rainfall in East Africa is determined, and to apply that improved understanding to issues of climate variability and change, including impacts.   Analysis of observations, comparing multiple datasets in this data-poor region, and output from high-resolution model simulations will be used to investigate these physical processes to produce a more comprehensive understanding of how the seasonality of rainfall is distributed across East Africa.<br/><br/>It is crucial to understand the seasonality of rainfall to improve our ability to predict change and variability, especially in regions such as East Africa where the population is highly vulnerable.  Variations in rainfall, including its seasonality, strongly impact the region's agriculture, economy, and water resources which, in turn, affect livelihoods and political stability.  These issues will be directly addressed within the project by relating observed and simulated variations and trends in climate variables to variables more directly related to impacts.  Changes in climate variables will be used to calculate changes in natural vegetation using a model that relates vegetation type to climate conditions.  Changes and trends in growing season days and surface water availability will also be evaluated.  These representations will provide direct input for impacts analysis.  The research project benefits the climate modeling field more generally in contributing to the development of regional-scale climate simulation, including high-resolution models that can explicitly resolve convection within the governing equations.  This is important since the parameterization of convection in models with coarser resolution, such as global climate models, is known to degrade simulations.  Broader impacts of the research program also include the education of graduate students in STEM fields."

These interactions can take several weeks to develop and mature, and may provide information about changes to weather patterns two to six weeks in advance, particularly during the fall and winter.  An important starting point for some of these interactions is a change in the tropospheric winds over Northern Eurasia that occurs over a relatively short period, generally less than two weeks.  This change in winds is associated with the ""vertical pulses of wave activity flux"", which can influence the polar stratosphere and, eventually, surface weather.  This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these short-term ""pulse events"" and their hemispheric influence by examining the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the events and investigating their role in the initiation of slower troposphere-stratosphere interactions that end up resulting in changes to weather over regions remote from the pulses, including over parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. This improved understanding will also provide an evaluation of the potential for considering these pulse events in the prediction of some aspects of weather variability up to several weeks in advance.  The events will be studied using observational data for examining their structure and investigating their underlying physical mechanisms, and also using the output of weather forecast models to assess how realistically models are able to reproduce these events and their influence.<br/> <br/>This investigation will provide a better understanding of how the troposphere and stratosphere interact and of one of the causes of variations in winter weather.  The project will also educate and train graduate students and include public outreach and education through development of a teaching portal, student presentation of tutorials through social media, and provision of an experimental forecast."

PAs addressed here occur in middle latitudes when the normal eastward progression of weather systems over a given location is disrupted. They are generally associated with splitting or meridional shifting of jet streams and are loosely synonymous with atmospheric blocking, although blocking has a more restrictive definition.  Interest in PAs comes largely from their association with high-impact weather events including cold air outbreaks, droughts, pluvials, and heat waves.  The project seeks to understand the fundamental dynamics which determine the frequency, intensity, and duration of persistent anomalies (PAs), as well as the changes in PA behavior that are likely to occur as a result of warming due to greenhouse gas increases.<br/><br/>PAs are broader in spatial scale than the weather fronts and cyclones that are collectively referred to as synoptic systems.  Studies of blocking show that synoptic systems play a large role in the onset and maintenance of blocks, a finding that holds true for PAs as well.  The PIs hypothesize that the initiation and maintenance of PAs depends on smaller-scale processes that occur inside the synoptic systems, including the organization of rain-bearing clouds (where condensational heating occurs) into mesoscale features (rain bands and squall lines, for example).  The hypothesis is motivated in part by studies showing that global weather and climate models with higher resolution do a better job in simulating blocks, despite the large size of blocks compared to grid spacing even in low resolution models. The PIs propose that higher resolution is better because it allows a more accurate representation of the much smaller mesoscale features where the condensational heating takes place.  Better representation of condensational heating leads to more vigorous systems, which can more effectively move low vorticity air across the jet stream from the tropics to high latitudes as required for PA formation.  One implication of this hypothesis is that models or climate states which are more conducive to high intensity synoptic systems will produce more strong PAs.  This argument suggests that PAs could become stronger or more prominent as climate warms, as the greater moisture content of warmer air allows for more intense rainfall and condensational heating.<br/><br/>The project examines PAs in present-day climate by identifying a set of cases and performing ""hindcast"" simulations of those cases using a global atmospheric model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, or the Model for Prediction Across Scales if it becomes available).  Model configurations which produce the best simulations of these cases will be identified, and a number of diagnostics will be performed to identify the key ingredients which lead to PA initiation and persistence. Additional experiments are performed using a technique in which the initial atmospheric state for the simulation is modified to remove particular synoptic features, in order to assess the role of these features in PA formation.  The impact of climate change on PAs is studied by repeating the hindcasts but with the background state modified to approximate the effects of greenhouse warming as simulated by climate models.  Long model integrations are used to consider PA behavior in a statistical sense, and simple single-layer models are used to further examine the basic dynamics of PAs.<br/><br/>The behavior of PAs is a topic of practical as well as scientific interest, given the close association of PAs with high-impact weather events that affect human activities.  The work addresses questions which are directly relevant to improving the ability of weather models to forecast PA-related extreme weather, and the ability of climate models to anticipate future changes in PA behavior.  In addition, the project provides undergraduate research opportunities through two new courses emphasizing collaborative research, one on data analysis and the other on numerical simulations.  An undergraduate internship is also supported in each summer of the project, and the position is advertised at minority-serving institutions.  In addition, the project will employ and train two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, thereby providing future workforce development in this area of research."

The current standard model of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) applies to the case of ideal, infinitely planar shock front; the process of acceleration is self-sustained if particles can contrast the flow advection and return to the shock to undergo further acceleration.  If particles cannot be confined in proximity of the shocks, then the DSA approach is not feasible.  The main focus of this one-year EAGER project is to explore a novel approach to explain the observations of energetic particles that do not fit in the DSA paradigm.  This approach will comprise both analytic and numerical analyses, which support the interpretation of spacecraft data.  The research project will produce an advanced theoretical model that may explain the measurements of shocks near the Earth, as well as observations of a variety of astrophysical sources, including pulsar wind nebulae, blazars, supernova remnants, etc.<br/><br/>This one-year EAGER project is aimed at transforming our present understanding of the acceleration of charged particles at interplanetary and astrophysical shock waves.  Several interplanetary shock events exhibit broken power-law spectra of the energetic particles.  Such spectra fall outside the regime of validity of the standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) model and, despite observed in several cases, have been poorly studied to date.  This project builds upon a previous effort to interpret the observed electromagnetic radiation from astrophysical sources -- a log-parabola spectrum of energetic electrons, instead of empirical, multiple power-laws -- that explains surprisingly well the observations of the Crab Nebula over an unprecedentedly broad energy range.  The project team, which based at the University of Arizona, aims to determine the physical conditions that give rise to a log-parabola spectrum, which would yield a paradigm shift in the field.

The largest component of Hg, gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is relatively inert but it oxidizes to gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) or converts to particle bound mercury (PBM) that are reactive and toxic. Therefore, it is critical to monitor these distinct forms of mercury accurately. The investigators' past work sponsored by NSF has shown that the commercial Tekran systems, which are used widely to monitor reactive mercury and accepted as the standard, are prone to large errors and systematic biases. Specifically, Tekran based reactive GOM and RGM show a persistent low bias and call into question our current understanding of mercury toxicity and exposure. The project will deploy a new suite of instruments globally to provide robust and well-calibrated measurements of reactive mercury globally to improve our predictive knowledge of mercury and its health risks for humans.<br/><br/>The project will develop and deploy a suite of new stable and sensitive instruments for calibrated speciated reactive mercury measurements at a network field sites where conventional Tekran systems have been operating. It builds on preliminary promising results that were supported by NSF. The instruments include a new active GOM system developed by the team that collects GOM on cation exchange and nylon membranes and then analyzes them for reactive mercury. The two-distinct collection and analysis methods will confirm the absence of potential biases from speciation or atmospheric sampling conditions (e.g. high humidity or ozone). This method has been shown to be highly selective with no interference from GEM that is present in much larger amounts. Furthermore, the investigators will deploy an automated GOP and GEM calibrator for routine field verification. Finally, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system to separate and identify various oxidized mercury compounds will be co-deployed at multiple sites. The 10 core sites will span the globe and cover a wide range of atmospheric conditions and emission cases. The harmonized bias-free chemically rich global mercury data on mercury will be analyzed to lay a solid observational foundation for the mercury modeling and assessment research community. The systems developed here will be commercialized and made available to the wider community for reliable speciated mercury measurements."

Alfven waves are an essential component of the dynamics and associated energy transport within the Earth's magnetosphere.  This has become more and more apparent with each satellite mission into the magnetosphere.  Significant Alfven wave activity has been observed by satellites traveling through the plasma sheet, the plasmasphere, the tail lobes, the auroral zone, and the reconnection regions in the magnetotail. Alfven waves are oscillations traveling along magnetic field lines. Much like waves moving outward from a stone tossed into the water, the Alfven waves carry information to other locations along magnetic field lines about changes in the magnetic field or currents at the site of their generation.  At these other locations, the waves can be dissipated supplying their energy to power different processes remote from the original energy source. For example, in the polar ionosphere, the dissipation of Alfven waves supplies energy to accelerate the electrons responsible for creating breathtaking auroras. These Alfven waves are thought to originate in strong plasma jets within the stretched magnetotail far from the polar ionosphere.  The project will support a graduate student for the summer thus contributing to the training of the next generation scientific workforce. The advances in knowledge of an energy transport process important to the dynamics of the magnetosphere will in the long term improve models of space weather forecasting, of value to a technological society.<br/><br/>The project proposed here will develop statistical maps of Alfven wave power observed by the NASA Polar spacecraft and quantify how these maps vary depending on solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters and storm and substorm conditions.

The study will use tools similar to and the methodology of earlier work by the PI, but will include 10 years of data instead of the one-year interval used previously. This will allow the statistical examination of Alfven wave power for a wide-range of different conditions and geomagnetic activity levels.

However, satellite observations have given a new view in which an estimated 60%-100% of the Earthward transport of plasma mass and energy through the magnetosphere is in the form of flow bursts (short-lived flows with velocities exceeding 400 km/s) and bursty bulk flows (longer duration flows containing flow bursts).  These bursty bulk flows (BBFs) are associated with plasma-sheet bubbles (regions of closed magnetic flux with lower entropy than their surroundings).  The lower entropy makes it possible for them to be more easily injected into the inner magnetosphere and thus, the particles they contain may be important seed and source populations for the ring current and radiation belts.  This developing view of the plasma sheet with bubble structures and bursts of Earthward flow is far different than the relatively smooth plasma distributions and large-scale flows in plasma sheet models that are in common usage.  The goal of this project is to construct the first empirical plasma-sheet model that explicitly includes the climatology of bubble/BBF injections during geomagnetic storms. The new model will be made freely available and thus serve as a valuable resource for other groups engaged in magnetospheric research.  Using this new model in a series of simulations, the research team will address questions that are aimed at enhancing understanding about the effects of the bubbles in providing a source population for the high-energy radiation in the inner magnetosphere. The project will provide support for the professional development of an early-career researcher, training for graduate students, and a research experience for high school students, thus contributing to building the future scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposers take an interesting approach to the construction of the plasma sheet model.   Instead of using observations to build an empirical model, the research team will obtain the statistical features of the plasma and electric field distributions in the near-Earth plasma sheet using systematic data-constrained computer simulations. The simulations will be optimized to match observed geomagnetic indices, statistical properties of bubbles/BBFs and the background plasma distribution. The newly constructed model will contain the full statistical information on both the background distribution and the meso-scale intermittent bubble injections. The proposal team will use the model to explore:  (1) how bubble/BBF injections modulate the background distribution of plasma and electric field in the near-Earth plasma sheet during different phases of geomagnetic storms, and (2) how the seed and source populations for the radiation belt electrons are transported to and distributed along geosynchronous orbit through bubble/BBF injections."

Model simulations of the response of the climate system to greenhouse gas increases show substantial changes in precipitation as a consequence of global warming, but models disagree on the details of these changes and the mechanisms for them are not well understood.  One mechanism commonly invoked to explain the changes is predicated on the fact that the moisture content of air typically increases with warming, so moisture convergence and subsequent precipitation increase in regions where moisture is already converging and causing precipitation in the present-day climate (drying is likewise expected in regions which are already dry).  But previous work by the PI shows that this ""wet get wetter"" argument does not adequately account for precipitation changes over land, where they have the greatest societal impacts.  Work pursued here seeks to better understand the precipitation response over land by considering the roles played by spatial differences in land surface warming and relative humidity change, through experiments with a simplified atmospheric general circulation model and analysis of simulations from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) .  Another argument holds that precipitation will increase over the tropical oceans where local sea surface temperature (SST) exceeds the overall warming of tropical SSTs, as the warmer SSTs cause the overlying atmosphere to be less stable than in neighboring regions.  But this ""warmer gets wetter"" argument neglects potential contributions from near-surface wind convergence, the radiative effects of water vapor and clouds, and changes in dry static stability.  These effects will be examined together using a diagnostic model in which precipitation is related to a shallow vertical mode which responds to low-level convergence, and a second mode which captures the dependence of deep convection on relative SST change.<br/><br/>Research on changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation events uses a cloud-system resolving model (CRM, specifically the System for Atmospheric Modeling) in idealized configurations to make up for the limitations of climate models in representing extreme precipitation.  Some simulations are performed using hypohydrostatic scaling, in which the vertical momentum equation is artificially modified to reduce the scale gap between the small scales on which convective precipitation occurs and the much larger scales of typical of the weather systems and high and low pressure centers found on weather maps.  This approach enables experiments incorporating both scales which would otherwise be too computationally expensive.  A further topic to be addressed is the effect of warming on extreme snowfall events.  The PI's previous work posits an optimal temperature for snowfall extremes which occurs because precipitation extremes increase with temperature whereas the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow decreases sharply in a range near the freezing point.  Work conducted here uses observed snowfall data and model outputs to test this theory and explore its implications for a warming climate.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potential impacts of changes in mean precipitation and the severity of extreme precipitation events.  Mean precipitation is important for agriculture and for water resources and their management, while extreme precipitation is often disruptive to society, and extreme snowfall events are associated with a number of costs in urban environments.  The project also supports and train a graduate student, thus contributing to workforce development in this research area. The project also provides summer support for an undergraduate student."

However, current operational models have difficulty to predict this oscillation.

The results of this project have the potential to improve air quality modeling by better representing ecosystem feedbacks to ozone pollution. <br/><br/>The team of scientists plan to collect two years of continuous data at the Virginia Forest Laboratory (VFL) in central Virginia, coupling ozone flux measurements with observations of canopy-level photosynthesis by solar induced fluorescence (SIF), isomer-resolved ozone-reactive biogenic organic compounds (BVOCs), and critical ecosystem parameters of canopy conductance and carbon dioxide exchange.

Variability in ozone flux to the canopy caused by these BVOCs can be quantified by their molecular identities and concentrations;  (3): Uptake of ozone by plants leads to one or more of 3 detectable and significant ozone-ecosystem feedbacks: (a) ozone uptake reduces stomatal conductance, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against plant uptake; (b) ozone uptake reduces canopy BVOC concentrations by impairing photosynthesis, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation; and (c) ozone uptake enhances BVOC emissions, leading to shorter ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation.

This research addresses the question how these two seemingly unrelated aspects of our planet may influence one another.  One causal link between the two is the pressure exerted by ice and the oceans on Earth's interior.  Volcanism is sensitive to such changes in pressure.  A second causal link occurs because volcanoes are the ultimate source of natural CO2 delivered to the atmosphere, and CO2 has a marked influence on climate.  During an ice age cycle, vast quantities of water are transferred between continents and oceans, eliminating thick ice sheets and changing sea level.  Melting ice uncorks volcanoes, leading to a pulse of much more active continental volcanism for several thousand years.  Glacially induced sea level change should influence how much Earth's interior melts beneath ocean ridges.  As sea level rises and falls the amount of melt delivered to make the ocean crust should vary by about ten percent, leading to changes in the thickness of the ocean crust and the depth of the sea floor.  This could be the explanation for the undulating topography of the sea floor known as abyssal hills.  The changes in volcanism at ocean ridges could also lead to changes in hydrothermal activity that would influence deep sea ecosystems and affect geochemical budgets of the oceans.  The large volcanic pulse following de-glaciation could add large amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to the rapid warming that occurs at the end of ice ages.  Ultimately, a better understanding of the influence of volcanic CO2 emissions on climate could provide an important context for understanding the significance of human CO2 emissions. <br/>      <br/>To test these potential relationships, we combine novel new observations with quantitative modeling.  High resolution maps of the sea floor will provide the bathymetric data to test whether abyssal hills vary with climate cycles.  New sediment cores near ocean ridges will reveal whether hydrothermal activity also varies with glacial cycles, and how much it varies.  Sampling and analysis of the volcanic rocks of the sea floor will show how melting of Earth's interior varies over time.  The sea-going work will take place on two cruises, one on a U.S. oceanographic vessel and the other in collaboration with German investigators.  On land, we will collaborate with leading volcanologists from the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the volcanic signal of Cascades volcanoes over recent glacial cycles.  Newly measured ages will constrain the timing of the volcanic response to glaciation.  Geochemical analyses will constraint how volcanism responds to glacial changes, and how much CO2 emissions may vary.  Modeling work will investigate exactly how changes in ice sheets and sea level cause pressure changes beneath volcanic regions on land and undersea, and generate quantitative models of melting of Earth's interior and how it responds to sea level change.  The final aim is an integrated model that links volcanism, CO2 and climate and tests how they may interact with one another over time periods of many glacial cycles.<br/>     <br/>In essence, we are exploring the coupling between Earth's interior and Earth's climate, perhaps discovering that even the fabric of the ocean floor may be responding to climate change ultimately caused by variations in the amount of solar energy our planet receives, and that glacial cycles are influenced by the pulse of the solid Earth."

They are the principle form of large-scale weather variability over the Sahel in summer and play a key role in bringing monsoon rains to this drought-prone region.  When AEWs continue their westward (or easterly) propagation over the Atlantic they can develop into hurricanes, and it is estimated that 85% of major Atlantic hurricanes (including hurricane Sandy) form from AEWs.  However, existing theories for the origin and evolution of AEWs do not satisfactorily account for many of their observed characteristics.<br/><br/>This project investigates several aspects of AEWs, including their origin and evolution, the structure of the AEW stormtrack (the typical pathway along which AEWs develop and propagate), intermittency in AEW activity, and interactions between AEWs and moist convection. A key component of the research, developed in previous work by the Principal Investigator (PI), is the idea that AEWs are organized into wave packets in which the dispersion of energy can be tracked according to an empirically determined group velocity. The dynamics are somewhat equivalent to the ""downstream development"" observed in synoptic weather systems moving along the midlatitude stormtracks, except that in the case of AEWs the energy propagation can be upstream or downstream (as AEWs form along the African Easterly Jet, the upstream direction is eastward).  Upstream energy propagation could have a number of significant consequences, including the possibility that energy from mature AEWs on the western end of the stormtrack could propagate to the region of AEW genesis on the eastern end of the stormtrack, thereby promoting the genesis of new AEWs. To some extent, the consequences of upstream and downstream propagation can be interpreted as the difference between convective and absolute instabilities of a unstable jet of limited zonal extent. In convective instability, wave packets growing on the instability of the jet have downstream energy propagation which moves the packet out of the unstable region. In absolute instability, the group velocity at the trailing end of the wave packet is upstream, so that some of the wave packet energy remains in the unstable region and promotes further growth. Thus, intermittency in AEW activity could be caused by a transition from absolute to convective instability, as in the latter case the energy does not propagate upstream into the AEW genesis region. <br/><br/>The primary tool for research in this project is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a regional atmosphere model applied over Africa north of the equator and the adjacent portion of the Atlantic.  Model simulations are performed using both the standard full-physics version of the model and an intermediate complexity version in which external thermal forcing terms are used to produce an idealized version of the African Easterly Jet and AEW stormtrack. In addition to simulations designed to examine the role of upstream and downstream energy dispersion, additional numerical experiments are planned to examine the dual structure often observed in the AEW stormtrack, in which southern and northern branches of the stormtrack are found in the free atmosphere (around 650mb) and in the boundary layer (925mb), respectively. Coupling of AEWs to convection is also studied, using the full-physics version of the model. Results of these simulations will be compared to field campaign data collected in the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) field campaign.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the links between AEWs and Atlantic hurricanes, including landfalling US hurricanes, and the monsoon rains of the Sahel.  A better understanding of the fundamental dynamics of AEWs could be of value for forecasting both individual AEWs and also periods of enhanced or reduced AEW activity.  In addition, the work will support and train two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

In the dayglow a unique signature of the O/N2 density ratio, from satellite-based UV observations, comes from measuring the intensity ratio of the OI (135.6 nm (3P2-> 5So2)) and N2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band (125-250 nm) emissions. This O/N2 density ratio is a key to understanding the ionosphere and thermosphere composition changes on a global scale under all geomagnetic conditions. However, the total emission cross sections of these two sets of spectral transitions have not been measured. Each of these two total emission cross sections is a sum of a direct excitation emission cross section and a cascade cross section. The cascade cross sections are about 30-50% of the total cross section. As the column density ratio O/N2 plays a key role in Space Weather studies, accurate absolute measurements  of Qem for both OI and LBH emissions are vital for explaining both the magnitude and temporal evolution of thermosphere composition (O/N2) changes. Similarly, the energetic proton (H+) and H atom impact laboratory measurements of Qem needed for auroral remote sensing are inadequate. The main focus of this is two-fold. One graduate student (UCF) and one undergraduate student would be supported in this effort.<br/><br/>The first goal of the award project would be to measure the absolute direct electron, H+, and H impact Qem for both the LBH band between 125 nm to 250 nm and OI (3P2-->5So2) at 135.6 nm from their emission thresholds to 500 eV by electron-impact, to 50 keV by H+ and H atom impact, using the team's experimental facilities located at Caltech/JPL.

Of particular interest is the energy transfer into the mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) region resulting from the coupling to the lower atmosphere, where there are violent phenomena such as thunderstorms, convective frontal activity, tornados, and other violent storm weather phenomena, as well as anthropogenic sources such as heating and air conditioning units, that will produce strong acoustic wave signals.

The project is aimed at establishing the extent to which acoustic wave structures generated within the troposphere will propagate to the MLT region and produce MLT heating through acoustic wave dissipation. The balloon microphone sensors would measure the acoustic wave energy flux for frequencies within the range of 1 to 10 Hz.  A PhD graduate student and a postdoctoral associate would be supported in this award.<br/><br/>These observations would take place with launches from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus, which will create considerable public interest in these experiments.

The need for this acceleration to occur implies the production within the magnetosphere of a  potential that is applied to the particles moving along the geomagnetic flux tube.  The challenging task in modeling this potential lies in producing an estimate of the inductive effects arising from the presence of a time-dependent magnetic field as compared with the potential that is a part of the plasma convection process across the geotail. The extent of this partition remains an unresolved question in geospace research. This award would model the physics of this acceleration mechanism to determine the magnitude of the inductive electric field caused by the temporal variation of the magnetic field as compared with the magnitude of the potential electric field source.

The former path would allow detailed data-model comparisons to determine which physical process dominates the dynamics of the magnetosphere.  The latter path would provide insight into the systematic influences of various solar wind parameters.

The project's high-resolution studies of flaring and active regions at long radio wavelengths should provide information that is potentially useful for space weather predictions.

Furthermore, since total solar eclipses are of widespread public interest in the countries from which they are visible, they provide an excellent opportunity for public education in the United States about astronomy in general.  Therefore, this project directly supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.  <br/><br/>This 3-year project is to take advantage of the 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse, especially to observe the white-light corona and work with highly processed images that bring out detail and extreme contrast, allowing improved measurements of dynamics of coronal plumes and other coronal features, especially coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and to observe the green-line (Fe XIV), and red-line (Fe X) coronas to contrast regions of different temperatures.  The solar observations include exquisitely high resolution observations with a Fabry-Perot.  Also, high-frequency (>1 Hz) power spectra of coronal loops will be used to compare mechanisms of coronal heating.  Spectrographic observations will allow the project team to investigate changes of the spectral-line ratios over the solar-activity cycle as the cycle, now past a low maximum, declines toward.

SAAMER was installed on Tierra del Fuego (TdF) to observe the large-scale dynamics within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) in the altitude range of 75 to 95 km.  This height range is where the semidiurnal tide and various planetary waves have a range of diverse effects.  This location is within a latitude band where these motions have large responses, but also where the existing MLT database of winds and temperatures is quite sparse. The SAAMER location on TdF was also motivated by the occurrence of the major 'hotspot' of gravity wave (GW) activity on Earth centered over the Southern Andes, Drake Passage, and Antarctic Peninsula. This hotspot is due to the major GW sources in this region, which include high mountains, strong jet streams, and the passage of vigorous frontal systems. These sources yield large GW events and significant MLT momentum fluxes (MF).  Strong interactions of GW structures with the larger-scale motions in the MLT region are to be expected, and SAAMER results to date confirm expectations that the fluxes in this region would be very large. This work has also revealed an ability to characterize meteor head echoes, non-specular meteor trails, and meteor radiants observed in routine measurement modes.  The new SAAMER studies would be more comprehensive than before due to correlative airglow imaging as well as new local Rayleigh lidar and multi-receiver radar measurements combined with the use of satellite observations by SABER on TIMED and CIPS on AIM for large- and small-scale dynamics studies. These multi-instrument studies will enable quantification of the important small-scale GWs (and MFs) having wavelengths h~20-100 km that are challenging to quantify without such correlative measurements. MLT dynamical studies, especially in regard to the quantification of GW dynamics, momentum transport and its deposition, are central needs in defining more accurate parameterizations of these dynamics in global research, weather prediction, and climate models addressing broad societal needs. Measurements of large-scale dynamics likewise serve to constrain models of these dynamics, especially at high southern latitudes. Meteoroid trajectory studies may provide clues to potential meteor impact risks. SAAMER is also an educational and training tool through various NSF programs devoted to promoting international collaborative activities between U.S. and S. American researchers and students, including extensive exchanges between the U.S., Argentina, and Brazil to date.<br/><br/>The research award to the PI would address MLT dynamics, meteors, and microphysics with focus upon the following questions:<br/>1) Continued Large-scale dynamics studies of mean winds, tides, and PWs and their structure, interactions, and inter-hemispheric and inter-annual variability;<br/>2) Further quantification of momentum fluxes by small-scale GWs employing SAAMER, the BU all-sky imager, and the IAP Rayleigh lidar, with exploration of GW sources and their propagation characteristics combined with the study of possible development of secondary GW generation, and influences by mean winds, tides, and PWs;<br/>3) Further characterization of the meteoroid population, velocities, trajectories, diurnal, seasonal, and global variability of meteor rates, and the meteoric mass flux into the MLT; and<br/>4) Routine measurements of meteor head echoes and non-specular trails and PMSE allowing studies addressing meteor ablation and PMSE microphysics."

In the dayglow a unique signature of the O/N2 density ratio, from satellite-based UV observations, comes from measuring the intensity ratio of the OI (135.6 nm (3P2-> 5So2)) and N2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band (125-250 nm) emissions. This O/N2 density ratio is a key to understanding the ionosphere and thermosphere composition changes on a global scale under all geomagnetic conditions. However, the total emission cross sections of these two sets of spectral transitions have not been measured. Each of these two total emission cross sections is a sum of a direct excitation emission cross section and a cascade cross section. The cascade cross sections are about 30-50% of the total cross section. As the column density ratio O/N2 plays a key role in Space Weather studies, accurate absolute measurements  of Qem for both OI and LBH emissions are vital for explaining both the magnitude and temporal evolution of thermosphere composition (O/N2) changes. Similarly, the energetic proton (H+) and H atom impact laboratory measurements of Qem needed for auroral remote sensing are inadequate. The main focus of this is two-fold. One graduate student (UCF) and one undergraduate student would be supported in this effort.<br/><br/>The first goal of the award project would be to measure the absolute direct electron, H+, and H impact Qem for both the LBH band between 125 nm to 250 nm and OI (3P2-->5So2) at 135.6 nm from their emission thresholds to 500 eV by electron-impact, to 50 keV by H+ and H atom impact, using the team's experimental facilities located at Caltech/JPL.  The team would also measure at the University of Colorado the cascade processes from these upper states.  Aeronomers at the University of Central Florida (UCF) and Computational Physics Inc.

While there have been a number of studies that have sampled atmospheric chemistry in the warm season, there have been relatively few studies in the cool season and none with the advanced instrumentation that the scientific community now possesses.  This is important because the processes that affect how much pollution is created and how far it travels depends significantly on water vapor and sunlight, both of which are dramatically different in summer and winter.  This study will examine how these processes work in cold temperatures and low sunlight and provide input to numerical modelers to help improve forecasts and provide guidance for policymakers on how to best reduce harmful air pollution events.<br/><br/>The Wintertime Investigations of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) project will take place in early 2015.  The main goal is to provide observations needed to develop a deeper understanding of the chemical and physical processes which govern the spatial distribution of anthropogenic pollutants during winter.  The researchers argue that a majority of observations in polluted mid-latitude regions have been in summer, when plentiful sunlight and water vapor lead to the rapid oxidation of NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by OH.  In the winter months when OH concentrations are much lower and temperatures are colder, different oxidation pathways are expected to be more important. This leads to the slower oxidation of reactive pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, VOCs and sulfur dioxide, resulting in longer atmospheric lifetimes and therefore the transport of these species over wider geographic areas.  The colder winter temperatures also change the equilibrium gas-particle partitioning of semi-volatile species (e.g. HNO3) favoring the formation of particles and resulting in seasonal changes in dominant aerosol components. For example, studies have shown that inorganic nitrogen is a much higher component of the aerosol in the winter.  The three primary research objectives are:  1)  Characterize the chemical transformations of wintertime emissions via multiphase, nocturnal, and photochemical processes, 2) Assess the dominant mechanisms of secondary aerosol formation and quantify the geographical distribution of inorganic and organic aerosol types during winter, and 3) Constrain wintertime emission inventories of key pollutants for urban areas, power plants, and agricultural areas, and characterize their export over the North Atlantic.  In addition to the broader impacts stated above, a significant number of students would be involved in the field campaign and data analysis activities.  Outreach activities will include a media day, visits by K-12 students, and project updates through social media."

The largest component of Hg, gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is relatively inert but it oxidizes to gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) or converts to particle bound mercury (PBM) that are reactive and toxic. Therefore, it is critical to monitor these distinct forms of mercury accurately. The investigators' past work sponsored by NSF has shown that the commercial Tekran systems, which are used widely to monitor reactive mercury and accepted as the standard, are prone to large errors and systematic biases. Specifically, Tekran based reactive GOM and RGM show a persistent low bias and call into question our current understanding of mercury toxicity and exposure. The project will deploy a new suite of instruments globally to provide robust and well-calibrated measurements of reactive mercury globally to improve our predictive knowledge of mercury and its health risks for humans.<br/><br/>The project will develop and deploy a suite of new stable and sensitive instruments for calibrated speciated reactive mercury measurements at a network field sites where conventional Tekran systems have been operating. It builds on preliminary promising results that were supported by NSF. The instruments include a new active GOM system developed by the team that collects GOM on cation exchange and nylon membranes and then analyzes them for reactive mercury. The two-distinct collection and analysis methods will confirm the absence of potential biases from speciation or atmospheric sampling conditions (e.g. high humidity or ozone). This method has been shown to be highly selective with no interference from GEM that is present in much larger amounts. Furthermore, the investigators will deploy an automated GOP and GEM calibrator for routine field verification. Finally, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system to separate and identify various oxidized mercury compounds will be co-deployed at multiple sites. The 10 core sites will span the globe and cover a wide range of atmospheric conditions and emission cases. The harmonized bias-free chemically rich global mercury data on mercury will be analyzed to lay a solid observational foundation for the mercury modeling and assessment research community. The systems developed here will be commercialized and made available to the wider community for reliable speciated mercury measurements."

The radiative effects of these anthropogenic aerosols are hard to quantify, and their climatic effect is among the largest uncertainties in projections of future climate change. The goal of this project is to develop observationally-based estimates of the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols using the best available satellite and surface-based datasets. More specifically, the research seeks to produce estimates of the effective radiative forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions (ERFari), which includes both the radiative effects of the aerosols and the changes in radiative forcing due to changes in clouds brought about by aerosol radiative heating. For example, the heating due to absorption of solar radiation by black carbon aerosols (soot) can lead to the ""burn off"" of clouds, resulting in more sunlight reaching the ground. Data used to determine aerosol amounts, vertical profiles, and radiative parameters comes from several satellite missions ( (MODIS, the CALIPSO/CALIOP lidar, MISR, CERES) and from the ground-based AERONET network. The aerosol amounts and properties are used in combination with a radiative transfer model (MACR) to determine the aerosol radiative forcing. The radiative forcing is then used as an input to global climate models, from which estimates of the further impact of aerosols on cloud radiative forcing are determined. Model-derived estimates of the cloud radiative properties are then compared to further satellite cloud observations. A key assumption of the project is that fine-mode aerosols can be used as a proxy for anthropogenic aerosols, provided that known natural sources of fine-mode aerosol (dust, marine sulfate, sea salt) can be factored out. <br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potential importance of anthropogenic aerosol as a regional and global climate forcing. Work to reduce the large uncertainty in this climate forcing could lead to better projections of future climate change and its impacts on human activities. In addition, the project would support a graduate student and provide a research opportunity for an undergraduate student at an ethnically diverse university. One of the PIs also performs outreach to local K-12 students through a local nonprofit organization."

The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate the role of wildfire in decadal climate variation and prediction. On the basis of wildfire observations in the past decade, the regions that the variability of fire is large will be selected for targeted modeling analysis. The working hypotheses are that the observed fire variability is regulated by regional climate variation and that the climate feedbacks from fires increase regional climate variability. Consequently, the simulation of wildfires and their feedbacks is essential for predicting regional climate variability on a decadal scale. These hypotheses will be thoroughly tested and the mechanistic process will be carefully analyzed using an extensive suite of observations and selected ensembles of climate model simulations. In this project, the modeling capability of wildfires and their climate forcing will be developed by building a new Region-specific Fire Model with Ecosystem Feedbacks (RFMEF). Regional climate forcing by wildfires and fire feedbacks to regional climate variability will be quantified. Lastly fully interactive regional fire-climate variability feedbacks will be investigated to understand the projections of decadal regional climate variability.<br/><br/> Understanding the interannual and decadal-scale regional climate variability is critical for designing and testing (regional) adaptation and mitigation strategies. Many atmospheric, oceanic, and ecosystem factors contribute to regional climate variability and most of these factors are already captured in the earth system models. One such factor not yet well represented is wildfire. The two-way interactions between regional climate variability and wildfire not only are important in improving the decadal-scale climate model simulation and prediction but also are necessary when applying the climate model to examine adaptation strategies targeted at the vulnerability induced by enhanced climate variation (due in part to these interactions) and to investigate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies of forest management practices. The open-source RFMEF fire model that will be developed for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) system and the climate modeling data that will be generated in the project will enable policy experts to conduct more in-depth analysis of climate policies in regions strongly affected by wildfire and allow other scientists to conduct climate simulations and prediction that include the fire-ecosystem-climate interactions and that are more suitable for their research and assessment needs."

Temporal clustering refers to the tendency of events to occur together in time, with the occurrence of an extreme event affecting the likelihood of a subsequent event. The proposed work is delineated in three phases, with research motivated by the following main questions: Do extreme hydrometeorological events exhibit temporal clustering, and, if so, which key physical processes explain this behavior? Can outputs from General Circulation Models (GCMs) reproduce observed clustered behavior?  Is it possible to take advantage of temporal clustering to improve the forecasting of hydrometeorological extreme events? The underlying hypothesis is that extreme hydrometeorological events exhibit temporal clustering that is controlled by climate processes. <br/><br/>The continental United States will be the focus as this area is plagued by a large array of natural hazards yielding extensive socio-economic impacts. Some of the most damaging hazards in this general area will be included: flooding and heavy rainfall, high and low temperature extremes, and tropical and extra-tropical storms. Cox regression models will be developed to examine the dependence of extreme events on climate processes.

The first meeting was a great success and since that time ISSS has been held on average every 2 to 3 years rotating locations between Europe, Asia, and the US. The next ISSS meeting will be the 13th in the series and following the tradition of rotating between Asia, Europe and the US will be held in the United States at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) from September 6-14, 2018. This project is for support for (non-UCLA) students to be able to attend ISSS-13. The ISSS meeting has provided new generations of students with a basic understanding of the numerical simulation techniques and is for many their first exposure to cutting edge space science research. Feedback from students over the years who have attended ISSS meetings has been overwhelmingly positive, with some saying it was their favorite meeting they attended as a student. Scores of previous ISSS students have gone on to careers in space plasma simulations as researchers, professors and civil servants at NSF and NASA. Since space science is an international endeavor, the international aspect of this meeting opens future space scientists and simulators to the world at large and initiates contacts and collaborations among scientists, researchers and students that last a lifetime.<br/><br/>The first four days of the ISSS meeting comprise the school portion and include intensive hands-on training with experts in the field such that when finished students will learn how different types of codes work, including particle in cell (PIC), hybrid and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), and will have run the codes themselves to produce output and graph the results. Basic simulation codes are given to the students, which are theirs to keep after the meeting for further use and study. The symposium portion of the meeting is held immediately after the school portion and allows the students who have just learned the basics of the various codes to interact with world experts who conduct cutting edge research in space science. The environment of the symposium is maintained to be student friendly whereby students can feel free to ask basic questions and interact with top scientists in smaller groups or one on one sessions, either at the science presentations, poster sessions or social events meant to foster teaching and collaboration.

The project works with high school science teachers to develop educational materials through workshops held on the University of Washington campus. The goal is to introduce the climate system in an accessible form, simplifying it as much as possible while retaining the essential elements and their interactions. Simple models are developed which use one or two equations to represent the evolution of global temperature in response to radiative forcing, incorporating factors such as feedback effects and time delay due to ocean heat storage. Despite their simplicity the models are closely related to cutting-edge research, as such models are commonly used to understand behaviors found in full complexity climate models and the observational record. The models and accompanying materials also introduce students to simple differential equations, scientific computation, hypothesis testing and the scientific method. A parallel effort is organized for high school science teachers in eastern Washington with the help of scientists and education specialists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland.<br/><br/>The research component of the award is an effort to understand the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration. This sensitivity, commonly referred to as climate sensitivity, is quantified as the warming produced by a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) over its pre-industrial level. Climate sensitivity is an important indicator of the risk posed by greenhouse gas increases, and much effort has been devoted to estimating its value.<br/><br/>But the extent to which the impact of greenhouse gas increases on global temperature can be represented by a single, fixed sensitivity value is unclear. Several lines of research suggest that global temperature becomes more sensitive to the radiative effect of CO2 increases as climate warms. In that case that the warming ultimately produced by CO2 doubling is greater than what would be expected from sensitivity estimates calculated at any time prior to the full temperature increase.<br/><br/>The temperature increase achieved when the climate system has fully adjusted to the radiative effect of CO2 doubling is termed the equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS. The terminology distinguishes between ECS and instantaneous climate sensitivity (ICS), meaning the incremental temperature increase from an incremental radiative increase during the ramp-up to CO2 doubling. ECS is a fixed value whereas ICS evolves over time, approaching ECS as the ultimate doubling temperature is realized. While there is evidence that ICS is always less than ECS, the excess of ECS over ICS has not yet been satisfactorily explained.<br/><br/>Research under this CAREER award seeks to understand why ICS changes over time and why it is consistently lower than ECS. A key issue in the research is the dependence of climate sensitivity on feedback mechanisms that are specific to particular regions. A simple example is the sea ice albedo feedback, in which warming causes sea ice retreat, replacing bright reflective ice cover with the darker ocean surface, causing more solar energy to be retained in the climate system and causing further warming. Since the albedo feedback only occurs within ice covered regions, the feedback strength depends on the warming of the polar cap rather than the increase in globally averaged temperature. The PI hypothesizes that much of the ECS-ICS difference is due to regional differences in the rate of warming produced by greenhouse gas increases: if different regions are home to different feedback processes and some regions warm faster than others, different regional feedback mechanisms will be prominent during different stages of the transition to a warmer climate. Changes over time in the mix of feedback processes can then account for the evolution of ICS. The research thus focuses on the spatial pattern of temperature increase, which is explored primarily through analysis of climate model output and a set of focused climate model experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the most dramatic and technologically harmful aspects of this space weather occur in the ionosphere from mid-latitudes to the polar cap. The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States.  The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure.  The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for.  The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration.  The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas.  In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad  variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. <br/><br/>SuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere.  By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns.  Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades.  The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research.  Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities."

MethaneAIR will provide new observing technology and research infrastructure for the atmospheric science community as well as opportunities for student education and research training and public engagement with science and technology.  <br/><br/>The MethaneAIR instrument consists of two imaging spectrometers that have been designed as the precursor to MethaneSAT, a small satellite intended to revolutionize measurements and modeling of emissions of CH4 from regional (100s of km) to fine scale (< 1 km) across the globe.  Two deployments of MethaneAIR are suggested to take place over Colorado on the NSF G-V aircraft during November 2019 and February 2020. In addition to high resolution measurements of the total-column dry air mole fraction of CH4 and CO2, the fine scale spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric airglow will be characterized and incorporated into retrievals of total column O2.  The research flights will incorporate emission surveys of major targets of interest, including the Julesburg Basin O&G field in Northeastern Colorado, the coal mines near Gillete-Campbell in Wyoming, and other targets along the Colorado Front Range such as cities, landfills, and cattle operations.  The EDF has committed to partnering with the broader community to apply these tools widely to atmospheric and environmental investigations.

Operated by the Geophysical Institute of Peru, Jicamarca is the equatorial anchor of the U.S. Upper Atmospheric Facilities radar chain and is the scientific community's main source of information about the equatorial ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Multiple new lines of scientific inquiry will be pursued at Cornell and Jicamarca expressly under this award. The broad goal is to quantify chemistry, transport, energetics, and dynamics in the equatorial ionosphere with radar and optical observations and compare the results with prevailing and emerging theories and models. There are ten topics that will form the core of the research to be pursued: (1) the structure and dynamics of the topside ionosphere in the equatorial region, (2) energy and chemical transport at high altitudes, (3) improvement in our understanding of incoherent radar scatter theory, (4) the dynamics and forecasting of equatorial spread-F plasma structures, (5) understanding the phenomenon of stimulated Brillouin scattering, (6) radar imaging of structures in the equatorial thermosphere and ionosphere, (7) understanding the anomalous radar echoes that come from the upper E region and lower F region of the ionosphere (the so called ""150 km echoes""), (8) the dependency of upper atmospheric winds as a function of magnetic local time (MLT winds), (9) observations of radar echoes from meteors and in particular from the head of the meteor as opposed to the ion trail generated by the meteor, (10) understanding radar echoes at ultra-high frequencies (UHF echoes).<br/><br/>The study of the equatorial ionosphere aims to better understand the effects it has on systems on which our technological society increasingly depends. The effects include the disruption of satellite-based communication and navigation systems like GPS, interference with terrestrial HF communication and over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, and the production of artifacts in synthetic aperture (SAR) and other kinds of radar imagery. Meteoroids of the size observed at Jicamarca could also pose a threat to space vehicles and habitats. Equatorial spread F (ESF) releases energy bound up in the ionospheric configuration near the equator. The ionospheric configuration becomes unstably stratified at twilight. The release of energy involves plasma dynamics occurring over scale sizes ranging from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers, producing rapid flows and deep plasma depletions; these plasma irregularities function as a diffraction screen for radio signals passing through it. <br/><br/>Jicamarca's mission also complements the primary mission of Cornell University, which is education. Cornell and other undergraduate, graduate, and professional students benefit from research at the observatory through direct participation in advanced research projects as well as through additions to the engineering curriculum. Societal impact comes largely through education and career development in the strategic area of radar remote sensing and also through technological and mathematical contributions to other disciplines in aeronomy, space physics, radio science, and astronomy. The opportunity for scientists and students in the U.S. to interact with scientists and students in Peru helps create important international collaborations."

On the atmospheric side the primary application of the machine is the Extended Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM-X), which is used here to study the mechanisms through which sudden stratospheric warming events (SSWs) affect the ionosphere.  SSWs are large-scale disturbances of the stratospheric circumpolar circulation in winter (typically over the North Pole) in which stratospheric temperature can rise by up to 50C over the course of a few days.  While these disturbances occur over the pole and at altitudes of about 20km, they can affect the electron content of the ionosphere over the equator at an altitude of 300km, where they can interfere with satellites used for navigation, communication, and other purposes.  The mechanisms by which this influence propagates over such great distances is not known but is believed to involve the vertical propagation of atmospheric tides.  Work here tests the idea that the SSW impact can occur because westerly propagating planetary-scale waves excited by the SSW produce zonal wind anomalies which affect the vertical propagation of tides, and the alternative hypothesis that the mechanism involves changes in the heating due to ultraviolet absorption by ozone.<br/><br/>The oceanographic work considers wave-turbulence interactions in the coastal ocean, an important issue for understanding the transport of sediments associated with erosion and pollution and for understanding water properties essential to ocean biology.  The work uses a large eddy simulation (LES) model, the Spectral Multi-domain model, to simulate waves in the near-shore ocean (bottom depths up to 100m or so). A key issue in understanding the interaction of waves and turbulence is the problem of separating the motion field into wave orbital motions and turbulence, which the PIs are attacking using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in which individual modes represent different length scales within the flow and have energy levels which follow the classical Kolmogorov cascade.  The cluster computer is used to calculate a three-dimensional POD which provides separate sets of modes to represent the wave orbital motions, small-scale turbulence, and nonlinear interactions between the two occurring at intermediate spatial scales.<br/><br/>The MRI award has broader impacts by providing infrastructure for research and education, including courses in oceanic, atmospheric, and computer science.  In particular, the computer supports the newly formed PhD program in Coastal and Marine System Science, the first doctoral program at the university.  Also, undergraduate students are strongly engaged in the assembly and maintenance of the cluster computer, thus acquiring hands-on skills in working with hardware integration and operating systems."

Without fully understanding the mysterious dropout of electrons, a full understanding and prediction of radiation belt dynamics cannot be reached. This is of considerable practical importance due to the hazards to space-borne systems. Many communications satellites and national security assets reside in this radiation environment and their lifetime depends on its dynamics. Advancing the science supports improvement of the predictive models and fits directly into the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, which was released in 2015. The project supports a female faculty member and will train and educate graduate and undergraduate students in both research and outreach activities. The learning module will provide an unprecedented informal learning opportunity on space science to West Virginia K-12 schools. It is expected to increase the awareness and interest of middle school students in the STEM programs in the state, and inspire them to pursue STEM careers, especially the underrepresented female and lower socioeconomic status students. The opportunities to develop and deliver the learning module will also provide valuable educational and outreach experience for undergraduate and graduate students and enhance their science literacy and communication skills.<br/><br/>Since the launch of NASA Van Allen Probes in 2012, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the strong enhancement of relativistic electrons. However, the fast and dramatic dropout of radiation belt electrons (orders of magnitudes in a few hours) remains unsolved. The open question exists: Where do the electrons go during the dropout? This award is to develop a new and comprehensive dropout model, named Relativistic Electron Dropout (RED), with physical and event-specific inputs to simulate the electron dropout and understand the governing processes. RED will include not only the traditional loss processes (pitch angle diffusion, magnetopause shadowing, and outward radial diffusion), but also the new mechanism called Drift Orbit Bifurcation (DOB). Physical quantification of these processes will be achieved based on realistic field and particle conditions. With these inputs, RED will simulate both the electron dropout observed at high altitudes and the electron precipitation observed at low altitudes to resolve the governing mechanisms. The wealth of energetic electron and wave measurements from Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, and MMS spacecraft that cover the region from the outer belt to the magnetopause and the multiple POES satellites at low altitudes will provide an excellent test base for the RED model. This model will be the first to incorporate all the major loss mechanisms during the dropout, including the new DOB process. It is capable of simulating both electron dropout at high altitudes and precipitation at low altitudes, which will make a significant contribution in understanding the governing processes during the dropout and resolving their relative importance. The physical and event-specific quantification of the magnetopause shadowing, DOB, and radial diffusion processes is new and critical for understanding the fast electron dropout as well as the overall radiation belt dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the most dramatic and technologically harmful aspects of this space weather occur in the ionosphere from mid-latitudes to the polar cap. The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States.  The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure.  The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for.  The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration.  The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas.  In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad  variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. <br/><br/>SuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere.  By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns.  Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades.  The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research.  Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities."

Recent disasters (e.g., Typhoon Haiyan in 2013; Hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Irene in 2011 and Katrina in 2005) underscore the significant vulnerability of the U.S. and the world to land-falling hurricanes. The impacts of these storms may worsen in coming decades because of rapid coastal development coupled with possibly increasing hurricane activity and sea level rise. This project is developing a new framework for assessing and managing hurricane risk based on fundamental physics. The framework will be applicable to all hurricane-afflicted coastal areas. We are carrying out case studies for the coastal areas in New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Florida to assess and compare hurricane hazards in these areas, estimate how these hazards may evolve in the future, and develop engineering and policy strategies for coping with these hazards. This research involves several disciplines, including geosciences, engineering and architecture, and social, behavioral and economic sciences, and is helping to prepare next-generation of specialists in the fields of natural hazards. The results from this research will support the rebuilding and increased resiliency of coastal areas in the U.S. and around the world.  <br/><br/>Physics-based hurricane risk assessment is challenging, due to multi-scale features of the phenomena. This research is advancing hurricane and climate science, with the objective of fundamentally enhancing hurricane risk analysis. We are developing two independent hurricane climatology models to investigate how hurricane frequency, intensity, and size will evolve in a changing climate. We are applying observational analysis and numerical modeling to study hurricane wind, surge, and rainfall hazards, including their spatial and temporal structures, their interaction, and effects of the coast, land, extratropical transition, and changing climate. We are developing physics-based, observationally-evaluated, and computationally-efficient hazard models to assess joint hazard probabilities under various climate scenarios; we are also creating a multi-hazard model of wind and water vulnerability describing the compound impacts of hurricane hazards. Combining the improved estimation of the joint hazards and vulnerability, risk assessment can then be carried out to support advanced risk management from various perspectives. The risk management component of this project is focusing on the policies of the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program and engineering designs for coastal flood mitigation. These instruments are critical in mitigating hurricane risk and increasing coastal resiliency, and this project will develop them in the new context of changing climate."

An overarching goal of this project is to determine whether observed changes in key climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity are a result of human activities, related to naturally occurring climate variability, or a combination of both. Given its influential agricultural sector, climate variability and change in South America can have global ramifications. <br/><br/>This goal will be accomplished through two tasks. The first task is to assess whether the changes in these key climate variables differ significantly from trends that could arise as a result of naturally occurring climate variability. The extent to which humans have influenced climate over the continent to date will also be quantified. The second task will be to systematically examine mechanisms leading to natural climate variability over South America, including patterns of variability such as the El Nio Southern Oscillation. Using this comprehensive understanding of the natural and anthropogenic influences on observed changes in climate, the ability of current state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce these features in simulations of the past will be evaluated.  In the case that a given climate model can simulate observed trends in climate and features of natural climate variability with reasonable skill, confidence in future projections of climate can be boosted. A major goal of this project to develop methods of conveying the multi-dimensional nature of the investigation results in a concise and easily interpretable way to better inform those communities interested in climate information for South America.  Furthermore, the approaches and methods used here will be extensible to other regions of the world.    <br/><br/>Key results of the project will be presented, interpreted, and made publicly available via a user-friendly website to serve both scientific and non-scientific audiences. These results will be communicated throughout the South American climate science and information communities via an email list associated with the World Climate Research Programme's Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).  Additionally, the project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral scientist and a graduate student.  All team members will participate in publishing results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in reporting results at relevant professional conferences and meetings. In all cases, the presentation style will aim to the broad community interested in South American climate science and information."

At global scales, detailed analyses have illuminated the controls on the SAF and sources of spread in SAF magnitude between global climate models (GCMs). While regional climate model (RCM) simulations over complex terrain suggest substantial regional effects of the SAF, no detailed quantitative analysis of the regional SAF has been undertaken. This project will quantify and diagnose the SAF in high-resolution RCM simulations over the Rocky Mountains (and later the continental United States) using the WRF model. They include 8-year reanalysis-forced control simulations and 8-year pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulations, wherein reanalysis boundary conditions are perturbed by monthly mean changes predicted by a GCM under greenhouse<br/>forcing. This framework allows for clean diagnosis of thermodynamic and mesoscale mechanisms of climate change in isolation from changes in large-scale circulations and storminess. <br/><br/>Analysis will include:  (i) Quantification of the SAF and its contributions from various physical processes: The SAF will be separated from other forcings and feedbacks via linear feedback analysis and via RCM simulations with a suppressed SAF. The mechanisms controlling the strength of the SAF will be diagnosed including: the relative roles of snow cover and snow metamorphism changes, the atmosphere masking of surface albedo changes, and the role of atmospheric advection.  (ii) Evaluation of simulated snow cover and albedo: RCM output will be evaluated against high-resolution remote sensing provided by the MODIS instrument (including the new MODSCAG snow product) to critically test the realism of the simulated SAF and identify sources of bias.  (iii) Examination of the interactions between the SAF and regional-scale circulations:  This will include a determination of the role of advection in balancing radiative perturbations and the role of radiative perturbations in altering thermally driven mesoscale circulations.  (iv) Comparison with other mountain ranges, forcing scenarios, and model parameterizations:  Analysis of additional simulations with different model configurations will be used to understand how geographic setting modulates the SAF.  It will also be used to examine differences in the SAF between simulations with and without changes in large-scale circulations or dust-on-snow forcing.<br/><br/>Educational impacts at the graduate level will include mentoring and training of a student.  At the undergraduate level, a course on the environmental science of mountainous regions will be enriched with RCM output from the project and field observations.  At the high school level, annual classroom visits and weeklong summer camps on weather and climate for local students will be developed.  These programs will serve urban districts with high populations of minorities underrepresented in the STEM fields.  The camps will engage students through lectures, demonstrations, hands-on laboratory experiences, and an interactive field trip to a local mountaintop observatory.  Students will be introduced to the university environment, career options, and a range of role models.  This will serve to enable, excite, and recruit students for future study and employment in the atmospheric sciences specifically and STEM in general."

This project will also train a graduate student to become an independent scientist. Besides participating in the usual activities of publishing papers and giving conference presentations, the team will work with personnel at Penn State's Center for Science and the Schools to conduct a five-day workshop on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction for middle and high school teachers from low socioeconomic and racially diverse urban and rural Pennsylvania school districts that serve populations highly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.

The team will provide follow-up support as the teachers implement the workshop activities in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In the tropics, the dominant pattern on the intraseasonal time scale, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), is characterized by organized precipitation systems that propagate eastward encircling the tropics on a timescale of 30-70 days. The importance of the MJO for forecasting is evidenced by the use of the state of the MJO in week-3 and week-4 probabilistic forecasts by the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center. Although much progress has been made during the past three decades toward understanding how tropical convective heating influences the weather in mid-latitudes, there are still important unaddressed questions. This project will focus on questions that have not yet been investigated or have received little previous attention: (1)investigation of how Rossby waves are excited by MJO-related convection in the tropics propagate pole-ward,and impact weather in the mid-latitudes; (2) variation in the horizontal and vertical structure of the latent heat released in convections within the MJO event, and its impact in a key region, the central subtropical North Pacific; and (3) role of inertio-gravity waves excited by MJO-related convections in connecting tropical convections to weather over large distances across the Earth, e.g., teleconnection patterns. <br/><br/>The team will also address the following questions: Why does the high latitude component within teleconnection patterns persist for a much longer time period than do their lower latitude counterparts? What is the impact of inertio-gravity waves excited by the MJO on mid-latitude weather? The topic is particularly important because active teleconnection patterns have a large influence on the weather up to 6 weeks later. The approach includes the use of observational datasets and computer model calculations. The computer model will be used to isolate and to better understand the key physical processes that are responsible for the tropical-extratropical teleconnections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The generation of midlevel rotation in supercell storms is well understood, but there are a number of outstanding questions pertaining to the development of rotation at low levels and the subsequent intensification of that rotation to tornado strength.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this research are<br/>- To examine how low-level circulation in supercells is controlled by the storm environment and buoyancy of the outflow<br/>- To investigate how environmental heterogeneity and storm interactions influence the development and evolution of low-level rotation<br/>- To determine how surface friction affects the development of near-surface vertical vorticity<br/>- To explore the origins of small-scale outflow ""surges"" and descending precipitation shafts on the supercell's rear flank and their influence on the development and evolution of low-level rotation<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Despite having a good grasp of how vertical wind shear and instability in a storm's environment promote updraft rotation, scientists still lack a thorough understanding of how many other aspects of a storm's environment, including environmental heterogeneity, influence the development and maintenance of low-level rotation in supercell storms. Even less is known about how storm interactions, sudden precipitation impulses, and outflow surges affect low-level rotation.

This research may help improve the guidance that can be used by forecasters to anticipate how long a tornado might last.  In addition to communicating findings to the academic community at conferences, both PIs have been directly involved with the transfer of new knowledge to the NWS via seminars.

These new observations of solar hard X-ray emissions will address outstanding problems in high-energy solar physics and advance our scientific understanding of solar flares, which play an important role in the development of space weather in the near-Earth environment. The project will also support integration of research and education to develop a knowledgeable STEM workforce.

IMPRESS will perform HXR spectroscopy of solar flares in the rising phase of Solar Cycle 25. The target launch date is late 2021 into a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with an inclination angle less than 60? and altitudes greater than 450 km. The scientific objectives of the IMPRESS mission are (1) to investigate flare electron acceleration timescales by measuring short (<2 second) spikes in HXR time profiles; (2) to investigate electron beaming in solar flares via stereoscopic HXR directivity measurements; (3) in collaboration with new space-based instruments, to provide a complete assessment of flare-accelerated electron distributions from thermal to non-thermal energies; (4) to develop and demonstrate a high-energy radiation detector that can measure a vast range of brightnesses in solar flares, precipitating electron microbursts, and other astrophysical bursts without pileup or saturation.

The TTL extends from about 14 to 18.5km over the tropics and is above the tops of all but the tallest convective clouds.  It often contains thin cirrus clouds which, though difficult to see, play an outsized role in trapping outgoing radiation and thus warming the troposphere.  It is sometimes called the ""gateway to the stratosphere"" because most of the water vapor in the stratosphere, and many other stratospheric constituents, enter the stratosphere by moving upward through the TTL.  The stratosphere is extremely dry compared to the troposphere, but stratospheric water vapor is of interest because it has an important greenhouse effect and can lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which play a role in ozone hole formation.<br/><br/>This project seeks to improve understanding of TTL processes by building and launching several instruments on balloons intended to fly at the top of the TTL.  The balloons are part of the Strateole-2 field campaign organized by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, and the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamic (LMD) of the University of Paris-Saclay.  Strateole-2 is a five-year campaign, with a small validation deployment in 2018 and full science deployments in 2020-2021 and 2022-2023.  Balloons are launched  from the Seychelles (about 5S in the Indian Ocean), with the expectation that each balloon will circle the earth for up to 90 days and observe the TTL between 20S and 15N. This award supports US participation in the validation campaign and the first full science deployment, along with post-campaign analysis.  It is one of three awards made to US PIs for participation in Strateole-2, the full set being AGS-1643022, AGS-1642277/1642246, and AGS-1642650/1653644.<br/><br/>One instrument to be built and deployed is an optical particle detector referred to as the LASP Particle Counter (LPC, named after the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). The LPC uses scattered laser light to detect aerosol particles with sizes ranging from 0.3 to 10 microns and is used to estimate the flux of aerosols entering the stratosphere through the top of the TTL.  In addition to the LPC the PIs are developing an instrument package called RACHuTS, for Reel-down Aerosol Cloud Humidity and Temperature Sensor.  The RACHuTS package weighs less than 2kg and is suspended from a nylon cable which is reeled down to 2km below the balloon gondola and then reeled back up again, each time generating a vertical profile of TTL conditions over 15 minutes. RACHuTS is lowered and raised 5 times each night while the balloon is aloft (the optical components do not function in daylight). The instruments integrated into RACHuTS are developed elsewhere.  These include the Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD, developed at ETH Zurich), the Fluorescence Advanced Stratospheric Hygrometer for Balloon (FLASH-B, developed at the Central Aerological Observatory in Moscow), and the Thermodynamic SENsor (TSEN, developed at LMD). A commercial radiosonde package is also used to record atmospheric pressure and GPS position.<br/><br/>One issue to be addressed in the project is the extent to which supersaturation is an important consideration in determining how much water vapor passes through the TTL and enters the stratosphere.  The amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere is limited by the temperature minimum at the tropopause, under the assumption that the amount of water vapor above that level cannot exceed the amount corresponding to 100% relative humidity at that level.  But it is possibly for relative humidity to exceed 100% in cases where ice particle concentrations are low enough and ascent is fast enough to allow moisture to reach the stratosphere before sublimation can occur.  The RACHuTS instruments are well suited to the study of supersaturation effects as temperature, humidity, and ice particle concentrations are observed together over a substantial portion of the depth of the TTL.  A further issue, to be addressed using the LPC, is the transport of primary aerosols into the stratosphere.  The PIs seek to constrain the size distribution of these areosols and address questions related to the stability of the distribution, its geographical variability, its relationship to convective overshooting, and previous observations of large particles with low number concentrations.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the value of the observations for addressing a variety of questions regarding TTL processes.  RACHuTS and LPC observations will be made available to the research community from servers at LASP so that it can be freely examined by the research community.  In addition, the project constitutes a demonstration of a novel technology for meteorological observations which could have a wide array of scientific applications.  Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area."

Here OHU refers to the transfer of heat from the ocean surface to depths at which the heat no longer longer affects the overlying atmosphere, thus effectively removing heat from the surface climate for a period of years to decades or longer.  OHT refers to heat transport in which heat is removed from the surface in one region, transported by the subsurface ocean, and resurfaces in another. The role of OHU in climate change has become a topic of some interest, as increased OHU could explain the hiatus in global warming following the end of the 20th century. Further motivation for the project comes from modeling studies showing that different spatial patterns of OHU can cause different amounts of global warming suppression, even when the total heat uptake is the same.  To some extent these differences can be explained in terms of regional climate feedbacks.  For example the sea ice albedo feedback can play a significant role in amplifying the global warming caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) increases, but sea ice only occurs in cold regions near the poles.  Removal of surface heat from high latitudes by OHU or OHT could reduce GHG-induced warming in these regions and thus reduce the amplifying effect of the sea ice albedo feedback.  But previous work by the PI and others suggests that the effects of OHU and OHT cannot be entirely explained in terms of regional climate feedbacks activated to a greater or lesser extent depending on how the oceans redirect heat. In addition, the effects of OHU and OHT cannot be understood without considering the role of atmospheric energy transport.  A previous study found that if OHU removes heat from the tropical oceans (or if OHT transfers heat out of the tropics), atmospheric transport of moist static energy will be quite efficient in spreading the effect beyond the tropics and evenly cooling the globe.  But an equivalent heat removal in high latitudes instead produces concentrated high latitude cooling, a difference which can be explained in terms of the strong background moisture contrast between the warm tropics and the cold poles. The work is primarily concerned with the ocean's role in current and future climate change, but it will also consider the role of OHT in producing past climates in which the temperature contrast between low and high latitudes was reduced, such as occurred in the Phanerozoic and early Eocene.  The research will also consider the response of the hydrological cycle to OHU and OHT, with a focus on the subtropics.   Past work suggests that while global warming simulations often find subtropical drying, subtropical warming due to OHT can produce the opposite effect.  Thus OHT could counteract GHG-induced drying to the extent that heat absorbed by the tropical oceans is transported to the subtropics, a potentially relevant effect given recent results relating the warming hiatus to OHU in the equatorial Pacific.<br/><br/>The research agenda for the project has two key components.  First, much of the work will be conducted using simplified climate models in which the ocean component model is replaced by a ""slab ocean"", which can absorb heat and interact thermally with the atmosphere, but which cannot transport heat.  In this context heat OHT and OHU are externally imposed in the form of heat sources and sinks applied to regions where OHT converges and diverges, and where heat is sequestered in the deep ocean.  Such external forcing is commonly used and is generally referred to as Q-flux forcing.  The experiments allow the feedbacks and atmospheric transports to be examined in isolation, without the complications introduced by an interactive ocean.  Second, the results of such experiments are often model dependent, and thus an ensemble of models is required to determine which aspects of the response to imposed OHT and OHU forcing are robust.  To address this issue, the PI will organize a model intercomparison project (MIP), in which a common set of experiments will be performed using several different models.  Some experiments will be performed by the PI, but he will also solicit contributions to the MIP by other researchers. Further research will include an examination of global warming simulations from state-of-the-art climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5), as well as perturbed physics sensitivity experiments with a single slab ocean climate model.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER project is centered on the development of a flexible climate modeling and analysis package in the Python language.  The educational activity is intended to address the lack of computing skills commonly found among undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in atmospheric science departments.  Specific tasks are 1) to develop a short introductory course in practical scientific computing in the Python language; 2) to develop a modular Python-based climate modeling and analysis toolkit; and 3) to develop a series of interactive educational modules illustrating fundamental principles of climate and atmospheric science.  Several factors motivate the choice of Python as the language of choice, including its inherent modularity, its ability to serve as a ""wrapper"" for compiled Fortran and C codes, thereby promoting seamless use of established codes, and the numerous visualization and software development tools available for the language.  The software to be developed will be open source, freely available online, and well documented. It will consist of a number of simplified dynamical core and process models (for radiative transfer, boundary layer turbulent fluxes, etc.), which can be integrated alone or combined in various ways to form simple a simple climate model.  In addition to the on-campus teaching activities, Python-based modules will be developed for use in a summer camp for local high school students."

Turbulence downstream of wind turbines that produces warming and drying, the urban heat island effect, and increased dew points near irrigated agricultural lands have all been shown to be ways that human beings change the atmosphere.  Although some prior studies have focused on the effects of anthropogenic forcing on local climate, few have addressed how human-induced perturbations evolve to affect downstream atmospheric flow on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Supporting the idea that these downstream effects may be significant, previous work involving adjoint sensitivity analysis has shown that high-impact aspects of the weather, such as the evolution of midlatitude cyclones, can be highly sensitive to localized, near-surface regions where human-induced perturbations can exist. The coexistence of these circumstances, anthropogenic perturbations and their potential to grow rapidly, suggest inadvertent weather modification may be a virtually unknown reality with serious consequences. As Earth's growing population will likely exacerbate the degree of present-day anthropogenic atmospheric forcing in the coming years, understanding inadvertent weather modification now is crucial.<br/><br/>This research aims to gain a holistic understanding of the various means by which humans modify high-impact storm-scale, mesoscale, and synoptic-scale aspects of the weather.  The approaches to achieving these goals are unique in that they focus on the interaction of estimated anthropogenic forcing and adjoint sensitivity analysis, which can effectively elucidate the important dynamics associated with different anthropogenic perturbation scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>It is expected that this research will leads to an invaluable foundation of scientific results needed for society to responsibly mitigate current and future inadvertent weather modification. Similar to how the human race is currently addressing the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission on global and local climate, a strong base of knowledge produced through this work can provide the information needed to strike a balance between beneficial human activities that perturb the atmosphere and the modification of sensible day-to-day weather such perturbations produce. In turn, this project has the potential to be intimately connected with the development of important government policy decisions worldwide.<br/><br/>The educational component of this work, which includes a museum exhibit, summer science camps, and portable educational kits for area schools, will likely make positive impacts to society well outside the confines of academia. Museums provide a casual learning environment that attracts a large number of mostly nonscientific visitors. Thus, it is expected that the museum education activities will reach many who would otherwise be unexposed to important scientific issues like inadvertent weather modification that can affect society, the economy, and the environment. In turn, this work has the potential to provide science education to the general public in a unique and effective way, improving the ability for society to intelligently address inadvertent weather modification in the coming years."

One of the major contributors to this uncertainty is the limited understanding of light absorption by BrC, which is often co-emitted with BC, thus coupling the effects of the two.

The land in turn affects the atmosphere by providing water vapor through evaporation and transpiration, giving off sensible heat and upwelling infrared radiation, and blocking the wind with trees and other obstacles, among other effects. Land-atmosphere interactions are thus an important topic in climate science, and a key goal research in this area is to understand the feedback mechanisms through which land-surface processes influence the atmosphere in ways that produce further effects on the land and vice versa. Much of the work in this area is focused on precipitation and soil moisture, particularly the extent to which evaporation serves as a source for later precipitation which further controls the amount and distribution of soil moisture.<br/><br/>Here the PIs go beyond soil moisture-precipitation feedback to consider mechanisms that link land surface characteristics to cloudiness and the subsequent shading effect of cloud cover on the surface. One of these is a feedback in which sunlight falling on moist soil produces evaporation, which leads to the formation of clouds or fog, which shades the soil and limits further evaporation. Previous work by the PIs suggests that this negative feedback mechanism plays an important role in limiting evaporation in the Amazon during the rainy season. An additional question pursued in this research is the extent to which small-scale differences in surface cover, such as exist between adjacent forested and deforested patches of the Amazon, produce differences in cloudiness as near-surface air converges into and rises above drier and hence warmer patches.<br/><br/>A key concern in studying such effects is that climate models have limited ability to represent them. Climate models rely on parameterizations to represent clouds and precipitation, and parameterizations have difficulty capturing the diurnal cycle of cloudiness. This is a severe limitation for studying the effect of cloud shading on evaporation, as the effect depends on whether clouds develop when the sun is high in the sky or near or below the horizon. Clouds simulated in climate models are also unlikely to respond to small-scales patchiness in surface cover, as models only represent aggregate cloud cover and surface conditions over grid boxes which extend at least tens of kilometers in each direction.<br/><br/>The PIs use two separate modeling strategies to circumvent these difficulties, the first of which is a limited domain cloud resolving model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, or WRF) constrained to relax back to a specified background temperature profile. This configuration is based on the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, which assumes that temperatures well above the surface are horizontally uniform due to the weakness of the Coriolis force over tropical regions such as the Amazon. The WRF-WTG framework allows for very high resolution simulations (grid spacing of one or two kilometers) over limited domains on which the processes of interest can be represented with some realism. The second approach uses a technique known as superparameterization, in which a somewhat simplified cloud resolving model is placed in each grid column of a climate model, creating a hybrid model which represents both the cloud scale and the large scale (see AGS-0425247).<br/><br/>Using these two modeling strategies the PIs perform a number of model experiments to determine the effects of the proposed mechanisms, including experiments in which the land surface turbulent heat flux is prescribed and simulations in which the diurnal cycle of land surface fluxes is reduced by imposing a very large soil heat capacity. The model experiments are complemented with analysis of relevant observations from a number of observing stations in the Amazon, some in deforested regions and some representing the transition from wetter to drier conditions.<br/><br/>The research has societal value as well as scientific interest, as it seeks to improve understanding of climate variability and change in the Amazon, a region of high biodiversity which plays a substantial role in the global water and carbon cycles. In addition, a variety of education and outreach activities are organized around the work, including work with high school students in Harlem, work with a STEM center housed at Cal State Los Angeles, and an undergraduate recruitment effort through the Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program at Rutgers. The project also provides support and training for a graduate student and a postdoc."

Most of Peru's population lives in the west coast desert which relies on glacier streams for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and municipal water supplies. Retreating glaciers also exacerbate geohazards and impact ecosystems, tourism and recreation. Understanding the impact of this acceleration of glacier loss on future water resources requires information about past changes in high elevation glacier mass balance which is virtually unknown, except from a few point-estimates based on ice core studies.  Such information is urgently needed by policymakers, governmental agencies, and public resource administrators to help guide mitigation and adaptation strategies. Educational and public outreach will be conducted through Ohio State University's Education and Outreach Program recently established educational and outreach programs in Peru.

This project examines how each is affected by the presence of mountains.  The research will analyze existing datasets including those of several past National Science Foundation funded field campaigns.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Heavy precipitation and flooding in regions of complex terrain can be understood and anticipated by identifying key ingredients.  This research identifies such ingredients associated with each of the three principal storm types.  The ingredients for deep convection will be examined and identified by comparing behavior of heavy rain-producing convection over the Himalayas, Andes, Central Mountains of Taiwan, and the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. These different venues provide a variety of synoptic and orographic settings so that the important ingredients for intense rainfall and flooding will be identified through comparison of the storms in these different regions.  The parental synoptic conditions range from baroclinic waves dipping equatorward over Asia, to monsoonal conditions, to equatorial waves, and diurnal forcings.  The ingredients for enhancement of precipitation when fronts cross mountain ranges will be examined for the coastal mountains of British Columbia to test the hypothesis that shear and thermally-induced turbulence enhance windward side precipitation.  The ingredients associated with the passage of tropical cyclones over mountains will be studied by examining Hurricane Karl (2005) and Tropical Storm Dolly (2014) as they entered and crossed the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico.  The roles of terrain-locked gravity waves and triggering of convection over the mountains will be examined as ingredients for modifying and prolonging the precipitation in the eyewalls and rainbands of tropical cyclones.  Through studying these types of enhancement of precipitation by the major atmospheric precipitation systems as they pass over mountains and identifying key ingredients, this project will contribute to a more general understanding of the effects of mountains on precipitating clouds.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This work will have the broader impact of laying groundwork for improved forecasting of heavy precipitation in regions of the earth most prone to flooding and disastrous societal impacts.  Further, by better understanding how mountains affect storms, future studies may better anticipate how the patterns of occurrence of natural disasters might be altered in a changing climate.  In addition, this project will optimize the use of past field campaign datasets and will contribute to training women and minorities for atmospheric sciences research."

The LPRB is the second largest hydrological  basin in South America after the Amazon, at about a third the size of the continental US.  The weather and climate of the region is dominated by the South American monsoon system (SAMS), in which summer (December to February) rains are fed by moisture which enters the continent in the equatorial trade winds, crosses the Amazon, and is transported to the LPRB by the South American low level jet.  Over the course of this route the moisture can fall as rain and be returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration multiple times, a process referred to as moisture recycling.  Previous work by the PI and others suggests that 60 to 70 percent of the mean annual precipitation over the LPRB comes from evapotranspiration from the South American landmass, with about 24 percent coming from local evapotranspiration over the LPRB.  Since the land surface is an important source of moisture for precipitation, soil moisture anomalies can become persistent as they lead to further reductions in precipitation.  In addition, land surface conditions can affect precipitation through their influence on the thermodynamic structure of the lower atmosphere, which can modulate atmospheric circulation and stability.  The key role of land-atmosphere coupling in the LPRB suggests that changes in land cover could have significant impacts on the local hydroclimate.  The PI notes that there has been intensive deforestation in the region, with perhaps the highest deforestation rate in the world for the period 2000 to 2012, thus it is of interest to understand how deforestation is affecting the monsoon system in the region.  More specifically, the PI seeks to understand the relative impacts of moisture recycling and thermodynamic/dynamic land-atmosphere feedbacks on South American precipitation patterns.  One hypothesis to be pursued is that the strongest land-atmosphere interactions occur during the late spring and early summer season in association with the SAMS, with a spatial pattern that highlights the transition regions linking the tropics and subtropics.  Another is that the thermodynamic/dynamic effects are more important than changes in precipitation recycling in determining the interannual variability of LPRB precipitation.  But the PI also hypothesizes that projected future deforestation in South America would change the relative importance of moisture recycling and thermodynamic/dynamic effects, and the shift would be accompanied by significant reductions in LPRB precipitation.  The research will also examine the extent to which deforestation changes the frequency and intensity of precipitation.   In addition, the project will consider how these feedbacks may change under projected future changes in land surface conditions.<br/><br/>The research agenda is built around three tools, a statistical approach known as the generalized equilibrium feedback assessment (GEFA) and two enhanced versions of the Weather and Research Forecast (WRF) model.  The statistical method is a multivariate lagged regression technique developed to quantify feedback strength, which can be used to determine the strength of moisture recycling on a spatially varying basis.  One version of the WRF model (WRF-WVT, previously developed by the PI) has been augmented to include tracers used to track water vapor transport, and this configuration can be used to determine the source regions of water vapor and hence the contributions of transport and local evaporation to precipitation.  The model has also been modified to use ecosystem functional types (EFTs) which can be adjusted to represent forested and agricultural land, and the model is able to simulate the mesoscale convective systems which account for much of the rainfall in the LPRB.  The other version of WRF is WRF-hydro, a community model which represents the subsurface component of the hydrological cycle, which the PI claims is "" particularly important over South America, as ground- water dynamics can completely change the atmospheric fluxes"".<br/><br/>The research is accompanied by an education effort in which three new courses would be developed to give students a thorough grounding in hydroclimatology  One course focuses on hydrometeorological observations, and will give selected students an opportunity to perform fieldwork during a 2-week period in the summer.  The fieldwork program is developed in partnership with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes (CW3E) at the Scripps Istitute of Oceanography.  For the period 2015-2018 students will participate in the Calwater2 field campaign to observe atmospheric rivers, taking measurements of  precipitation, stream flow, and soil moisture.  A second course introduces students to numerical modeling using the WRF-hydro model, and in this class selected students travel to the National Center for Atmospheric Research during the summer to participate in model development.  A third course is developed to teach basic hydrology to students with an atmospheric science background.  This course replaces traditional hydrology courses, in which the subject is taught from an atmospheric science perspective.  The course is intended as an alternative to typical hydrology courses in which the focus is on issues relating to the construction and operation of waterworks.  The course attempts to develop a unified language for the description of surface and subsurface processes, which is analogous to the conceptual framework used for atmospheric processes and helps students to work with models which incorporate atmosphere, surface, and subsurface components."

Mineral dust particles (particles composed of soil minerals, as opposed to soot and biological materials) are the most important IN in the atmosphere, and they can change the radiative properties of clouds by increasing the concentration of cloud ice particles at the expense of supercooled liquid water droplets.  Measurement from ice cores suggest that atmospheric dust concentration varies by a factor of three to four between ice ages and interglacials, thus the modulation of clouds by dust could have important climatic consequences.  In addition, the anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric dust, through changes in land cover including desertification, is estimated to be as high as 25% of the total burden, so that the role of dust in ice nucleation could lead to anthropogenic influences on climate.<br/><br/>The first task of the project is to improve the representation of the effect of mineral dust on cloud ice nucleation in atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs, including the atmospheric component models of coupled climate models).  Preliminary work for the project shows that AGCM-simulated clouds are deficient in supercooled liquid water droplets in comparison to satellite observations.  Work in this project is based on the hypothesis that this deficiency is due to an exaggeration of the Wegener-Bergeron Findeison (WBF) process, in which cloud ice particles grow at the expense of neighboring supercooled droplets due to the difference in saturation vapor pressure over liquid water and ice.  In nature the process is limited by its dependence on small-scale updraft and downdraft motions, which create local atmospheric temperatures which can be unfavorable to the process.  Work under this project will develop a parameterization the effect of these small-scale vertical motions, which occur on spatial scales too small to resolve in current AGCMs.  Once the parameterization is developed, it will be used to address several questions regarding the effects of dust on clouds and the climatic consequences of these effects, including:  What is the net radiative effect of mineral dust perturbations in Earth's atmosphere when dust-ice-cloud effects are taken into account? Have the dust perturbations in past climates significantly impacted those climates via dust effects on ice-containing clouds? Have variations in atmospheric dust loadings over the twentieth century acted as an important climate forcing via effects on ice-containing clouds? Under the current atmospheric mineral dust loading, how sensitive are ice-containing clouds to IN perturbations?<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER proposal is organized in collaboration with the Yale Science Collaborative Hands-On Learning and Research (SCHOLAR) program, which offers a two-week on-campus residential summer learning program in STEM fields.  Students in the SCHOLAR program come from the New Haven public high school system, and more than half of the students are from underrepresented groups, in many cases from families in which they would be the first to complete college.  Work under this award will develop a module for the SCHOLAR program to introduce students to the fields of atmospheric and climate science, and more specifically to the roles played by aerosols and clouds in shaping weather and climate.  The module includes both classroom and laboratory activities, and each summer a group of four students is selected to participate in a field experience at the Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) in Steamboat Springs Colorado, during the following Spring. The students spend four days at SPL making measurements of aerosols and clouds under the PI's supervision, and make presentations of their research at their schools and at the next SCHOLAR session. In addition, the PI maintains a blog to which students contribute before, during, and after their visit to SPL."

Its high mountains hold great volumes of glacial ice, with seasonal snow melt supplying up to 80% of the region's fresh water needs. However, since the 1960s, central Asia has lost over 14% of its glacier covered area and ~18% of its ice volume. Changes in glacially-fed hydrologic systems impact water availability and biodiversity in these regions. However, these observations cover only a fraction of the climate history of this region. Ice cores from glaciers in the high Himalayas preserve records of millennia of climate changes.

The results will be used to reconstruct the dynamics and rates of moderate, abrupt, and threshold changes in climate in Central Asia. Specifically, the research team will generate annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice cores (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles), recover pollen and other biological materials, and compare the results with ice core and other paleo records from the interior of Asia.

The land in turn affects the atmosphere by providing water vapor through evaporation and transpiration, giving off sensible heat and upwelling infrared radiation, and blocking the wind with trees and other obstacles, among other effects. Land-atmosphere interactions are thus an important topic in climate science, and a key goal research in this area is to understand the feedback mechanisms through which land-surface processes influence the atmosphere in ways that produce further effects on the land and vice versa. Much of the work in this area is focused on precipitation and soil moisture, particularly the extent to which evaporation serves as a source for later precipitation which further controls the amount and distribution of soil moisture.<br/><br/>Here the PIs go beyond soil moisture-precipitation feedback to consider mechanisms that link land surface characteristics to cloudiness and the subsequent shading effect of cloud cover on the surface. One of these is a feedback in which sunlight falling on moist soil produces evaporation, which leads to the formation of clouds or fog, which shades the soil and limits further evaporation. Previous work by the PIs suggests that this negative feedback mechanism plays an important role in limiting evaporation in the Amazon during the rainy season. An additional question pursued in this research is the extent to which small-scale differences in surface cover, such as exist between adjacent forested and deforested patches of the Amazon, produce differences in cloudiness as near-surface air converges into and rises above drier and hence warmer patches.<br/><br/>A key concern in studying such effects is that climate models have limited ability to represent them. Climate models rely on parameterizations to represent clouds and precipitation, and parameterizations have difficulty capturing the diurnal cycle of cloudiness. This is a severe limitation for studying the effect of cloud shading on evaporation, as the effect depends on whether clouds develop when the sun is high in the sky or near or below the horizon. Clouds simulated in climate models are also unlikely to respond to small-scales patchiness in surface cover, as models only represent aggregate cloud cover and surface conditions over grid boxes which extend at least tens of kilometers in each direction.<br/><br/>The PIs use two separate modeling strategies to circumvent these difficulties, the first of which is a limited domain cloud resolving model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, or WRF) constrained to relax back to a specified background temperature profile. This configuration is based on the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, which assumes that temperatures well above the surface are horizontally uniform due to the weakness of the Coriolis force over tropical regions such as the Amazon. The WRF-WTG framework allows for very high resolution simulations (grid spacing of one or two kilometers) over limited domains on which the processes of interest can be represented with some realism. The second approach uses a technique known as superparameterization, in which a somewhat simplified cloud resolving model is placed in each grid column of a climate model, creating a hybrid model which represents both the cloud scale and the large scale (see AGS-0425247).<br/><br/>Using these two modeling strategies the PIs perform a number of model experiments to determine the effects of the proposed mechanisms, including experiments in which the land surface turbulent heat flux is prescribed and simulations in which the diurnal cycle of land surface fluxes is reduced by imposing a very large soil heat capacity. The model experiments are complemented with analysis of relevant observations from a number of observing stations in the Amazon, some in deforested regions and some representing the transition from wetter to drier conditions.<br/><br/>The research has societal value as well as scientific interest, as it seeks to improve understanding of climate variability and change in the Amazon, a region of high biodiversity which plays a substantial role in the global water and carbon cycles. In addition, a variety of education and outreach activities are organized around the work, including work with high school students in Harlem, work with a STEM center housed at Cal State Los Angeles, and an undergraduate recruitment effort through the Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program at Rutgers. The project also provides support and training for a graduate student and a postdoc."

Of particular interest is the question of the scale of coupling of the lower atmosphere, where phenomena such as thunderstorms exist, to the ionized layer near 100-120 km. The physics of lightning phenomenology within thunderstorm events are very complex and highly time-dependent with complex morphology characterizing the coupling of lightning bolts to the ionosphere with consequential significant temporal behavior of the ionized density of the lower ionosphere region.  These electrical discharges are initiated inside thunderstorms and are rooted in one of the main thundercloud charge layers. This award would study the physical processes underlying the particular transient lightning bolt structures referred to as blue starters, jets, and gigantic jets, which are the upward electrical discharges from thunderstorms that terminate at 20-30 km, 40-50 km and 70-90 km altitude, respectively.  These are generated suddenly within a fraction of a second from thunderstorms. The research supported by this award would examine the energetics and dynamics of these TIL (Transient Luminous Event) phenomena. Typically, the initial vertical development has a speed of ~100 km/s, but after 100-300 ms, the upward discharge leading to gigantic jets suddenly accelerates to reach the lower ionosphere with a speed greater than 1000 km/s. The funded research would be primarily observational involving the construction of a high-speed (5,000 frames per second) spectrograph that can analyze the energetics of the jets and starters through the fast acquisition of visible atomic and molecular spectra allowing high-speed measurements of the relative intensities of the red-to-blue colors emitted by the lightning bolt along its path between the storm and the ionized layer. Analysis of these spectra would provide the time variations of the vertical temperature profile within the ionized air pathway of the lightning bolt. This information about the temperature profile would be used to quantify the energetics underlying the formation of these morphological features of the lightning bolt.  This award has the potential of transformative research that would provide a major advance in the knowledge and understanding of the physics of transient plasma discharges which should prove to be extremely valuable and of high importance to the study of laboratory electrical discharges and tropospheric lightning investigations; such findings would be of great value to other disciplines such as power transformers, laser fusion research, and plasma discharge systems.  The award would support significant activity in STEM education and student training similar to that recently conducted by the PI and his group.  Finally, this award has a strong potential of attracting public attention via local TV and newspaper interviews.  The grant awardees indicated also that they would provide the public with excellent public access to the research with frequent open lectures that would generate strong interest by the public in lightning phenomena.<br/><br/>The award represents a strong potential for exciting and transformative science. The proposed research would examine in detail fundamental science questions that are related to jet and starter dynamics and their electrical coupling between the lower atmosphere and ionosphere.  Moreover, the proposed observational approach is sophisticated providing critical high-time resolution spectral information on the spectral properties of starters and jets that would be studied to produce height profiles of temperature along the path of the conductive path between the top side of the thunderstorm and the lower ionosphere region established by the lightning bolt."

These activities will be undertaken in addition to dissemination efforts via publications, presentations, and workshops to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>A common problem in many areas of physics is the motion of material in a moving medium.  In recent years, a mathematical technique called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) has been used to model how these materials drift and spread with time.  LCS represent the material surface in an unsteady flow separating regions that evolve in qualitatively different ways. Whether the dynamical equations are unknown or unsolvable, the LCS can be an organizing structure in the flow that provides a new context and framework for understanding the system interactions. LCS analysis draws upon the latest knowledge in other disciplines, and it treats the unsteady flow, a historically complex and unpredictable phenomenon. LCS can help to refine our understanding of the underlying dynamics, by providing evidence of the physical processes that lead to unsteady flow divergence.  Although LCS has been used to study the motion of clouds of material in wind, aerodynamic flows, and fluids, it has never been applied to the upper atmosphere.  In this study, the investigators will use LCS to investigate the behavior of structures (e.g., meteoric smoke particles; climate change-related pollutants; space debris) deposited in the upper atmosphere. The goal is to use LCS to determine the mid-to-high-latitude flow fields and their time evolution, the ability to detect and follow these structures during disturbed conditions, and the seeding and propagation of turbulent mixing at equatorial latitudes, which leads to small-scale disturbances and radio signal scintillation that affects HF communications and satellite-based navigation. Successful development of LCS in this study can enable future studies of LCS analyzing the motion of vertical flow in equatorial regions. LCS analysis can be used to understand the chaotic mixing in IT fluid that may cause scintillation, leading to better operational forecasting."

Changes in glacially-fed hydrologic systems impact water availability and biodiversity in these regions. However, these observations cover only a fraction of the climate history of this region.

The results will be used to reconstruct the dynamics and rates of moderate, abrupt, and threshold changes in climate in Central Asia. Specifically, the research team will generate annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice cores (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles), recover pollen and other biological materials, and compare the results with ice core and other paleo records from the interior of Asia. Chronological control will be established with a variety of techniques (layer counting, radiocarbon, beryllium-10, lead-210, and tritium).

The large-scale flare simulation will be used to set up the context and initial conditions for the detailed full 3-D simulation of the reconnection region.  The outputs of the detailed small scale 3-D simulation, in turn, will provide feedback and update the large-scale simulation to evaluate the consequences of small-scale energy release processes.

An overarching goal of this project is to determine whether observed changes in key climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity are a result of human activities, related to naturally occurring climate variability, or a combination of both. Given its influential agricultural sector, climate variability and change in South America can have global ramifications. <br/><br/>This goal will be accomplished through two tasks. The first task is to assess whether the changes in these key climate variables differ significantly from trends that could arise as a result of naturally occurring climate variability. The extent to which humans have influenced climate over the continent to date will also be quantified. The second task will be to systematically examine mechanisms leading to natural climate variability over South America, including patterns of variability such as the El Nio Southern Oscillation. Using this comprehensive understanding of the natural and anthropogenic influences on observed changes in climate, the ability of current state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce these features in simulations of the past will be evaluated.  In the case that a given climate model can simulate observed trends in climate and features of natural climate variability with reasonable skill, confidence in future projections of climate can be boosted. A major goal of this project to develop methods of conveying the multi-dimensional nature of the investigation results in a concise and easily interpretable way to better inform those communities interested in climate information for South America.

Additionally, the project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral scientist and a graduate student.  All team members will participate in publishing results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in reporting results at relevant professional conferences and meetings.

These models capture the basic physics of climate change, but their utility is limited by uncertainties in the representation of important feedback effects.  For example in the snow albedo feedback (SAF) warmer conditions lead to reductions in snow cover, replacing a highly reflective snow surface with darker underlying ground cover which absorbs more sunlight, thereby enhancing the initial warming (the opposite holds in a cooling climate).  In this project the PIs seek to improve the representation of feedbacks in GCMs by relating observations of present-day climate to simulations of climate change.  To do this the PIs use the method of ""emergent constraints"", which in this context refers to relationships between present-day and future climate change simulations which are robust across an ensemble of GCMs.  Previous work by the PIs has shown that the strength of the SAF calculated from future climate simulations is strongly correlated with the SAF derived from the seasonal cycle in present-day simulations from the same models.  The SAF derived from the present-day seasonal cycle can be compared with real-world observations, thus providing a means to use available observations to determine which GCMs are most likely to correctly represent the SAF contribution to climate change.  The constraint is emergent in the sense that it emerges from a physically motivated examination of the robust collective behavior of an ensemble of GCMs, rather than from a first-principles derivation.<br/><br/>The PIs' previous work (see AGS-0135136) established the usefulness of emergent constraints as a way to validate feedback strength in climate change simulations, and the present work seeks to go beyond validation and use such constraints as a means to improve the representation of feedbacks in models. Model development is a more challenging application of emergent constraints than model validation, as the constraints must be specifically related to particular physical parameterizations in the model. In particular, the PIs seek to identify aspects of the land surface component model of the GCM which are key determinants of SAF strength, and determine how they can be adjusted to reduce biases in SAF strength.  Possible candidates include the apportionment of snow between the ground and the vegetation canopy.  The scope of the work may be expanded to consider the sea ice albedo feedback, which operates similarly to SAF as described above and includes a role for snow on sea ice in determining feedback strength.<br/><br/>Further research will consider emergent constraints that determine the extent to which the global hydrological cycle responds to global warming induced by greenhouse gas increases.  The global hydrological cycle is expected to accelerate in a warming climate, with increases in global evaporation and precipitation at a rate of a few percent per degree of warming.  The reasons for expecting acceleration are well understood, but there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of the acceleration, as represented by the large model-to-model spread in climate change simulations.  Work here attempts to derive emergent constraints for the hydrological cycle by examining the changes in the atmospheric energy budget that accompany changes in precipitation and evaporation.  The emergent constraints connect precipitation-related changes in atmospheric energy budgets from climate change simulations to aspects of atmospheric energetics in present-day simulations, which can then be compared to satellite-based observations.   Preliminary work shows, for example, that the clear sky shortwave absorption in climate change simulations is highly correlated with the sensitivity of clear sky shortwave absorption to total precipitable water (TPW) in control simulations. This constraint is of interest because sensitivity to TPW can be constrained by satellite observations, and it is also closely related to the parameterization of shortwave radiative transfer in GCMs.<br/><br/>The reduction of uncertainty in model projections of future climate change is of societal as well as scientific interest, as reductions in uncertainty would increase the value of climate change projections used by stakeholders and policy makers confronting the possible impacts of climate change.  The PIs will work directly with modeling centers in their model development work, convening special sessions at annual scientific meetings in which results of the project will be shared and key members of the modeling community will offer guidance.  Results of these sessions will be synthesized in research publications, in an effort to catalyze a broad effort to improve model parameterizations.<br/><br/>In addition, an outreach activity is planned to explain climate models and their uncertainties to the general public. Despite the clear need for accurate, up-to-date, and easily comprehensible information about GCMs, their sources of uncertainty, and the work being done to improve them, such information is not easily available at present.  To address this need the project will develop and maintain a website to serve as an educational resource on climate modeling. The website will contain a GCM primer, discussion of sources of uncertainty, and an assessment of the strengths and limitations of GCMs.  Further outreach will be conducted through public lectures and demonstrations held at the Discovery Cube, a local science museum.  This outreach will include the development of videos to be presented on a Science on a Sphere (SoS) display, and these will be available for use on other SoS displays worldwide.  Finally, the project provides for the education and training of a graduate student, thereby developing the future workforce in this scientific area."

The new method will use a novel acetaldehyde/nitric oxide chemical amplification approach to greatly improve upon the traditional chemical amplification technique that uses carbon monoxide (CO) for measuring peroxy radicals. A prototype version of the instrument has been developed and successfully tested it in the laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Peroxy radicals are important because they react with nitric oxide in the atmosphere to form ozone, a potent greenhouse gas and an air pollutant with adverse health and ecological impacts on humans and plants.<br/><br/>The acetaldehyde-based amplification factor is predicted to be relatively stable and is not expected to vary significantly with relative humidity, as does the CO factor. The method also will enable the peroxy radicals to be speciated due to differences in wall loss rates resulting from the addition of a sampling scrubber made of a material that is much more reactive to the hydroperoxy radical (HO2) than to RO2 (peroxy radical where R is an organic substituent). Several candidate materials have been identified and will be thoroughly investigated in the project. Prior to field-testing, the instrument will be tested for interferences by peroxyacetyl nitrate, nitrate radical, and other possible interferents and calibrated using multiple calibration sources to provide confidence that the measurements are not compromised by systematic errors associated with any particular calibration method. <br/><br/>A preliminary field test will be conducted in outdoor air in Amherst over a period of a week or more, with periodic automated standard additions of nitrogen dioxide and HO2. Deployments of the new instrument will take place during the summers of 2015 to 2017 at forest sites that with different environmental conditions, such as differences in nitrogen oxide concentrations and/or types of emissions of biogenic volatile organic hydrocarbons. During these deployments, several other scientific teams will bring their instruments to participate in an intercomparison of peroxy radical measurement methods. This project addresses key knowledge gaps relevant to climate change and air pollution science."

Characterizing and understanding large-scale hydroclimate variability during the last millennium is a critical means of evaluating and improving projections of future hydroclimate change. <br/><br/>Why this research now? Two recent developments make the time ripe for significant advances in this area of research.  First, fully pan-Pacific reconstructions of last-millennium hydroclimate variability are now within reach. Second, the large and growing ensemble of last-millennium simulations with fully-coupled climate models make dynamic investigations of past hydroclimate change possible thereby providing potentially improved assessments of projected future risks and impacts.<br/><br/>The project will help improve the understanding of extreme climatic events climate and includes a substantive leveraging of international collaboration with South American colleagues in Argentina and Chile, creation of a user-friendly drought atlas, and public outreach on science and education."

Globally, each year, these severe weather events cause intense rainfall, hailstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and landslides which in turn result in significant crop losses, property damage, urban hazards and loss of human life. Despite the enormous impact such events have on society, the mechanisms driving intense, organized convection and the coupled hydrological responses from those events are not well understood.  In this work, we will perform an observational field campaign and coupled modeling study using focused on warm season convection in the Carcara River basin in Argentina. The geographical focus on this region stems from the fact that some of the world's deepest and largest convective storms develop at the foothills of the Sierras de Crdoba - a mountain range east of the Andes which is the headwaters of the Carcara. Compared to the Great Plains of the United States, convective organization and propagation in subtropical South America is more frequent and confined to a much smaller region - which causes the Carcara river basin to be continuously affected by these severe storms, confines the spatial extent of the observational studies and increases the probability of capturing extreme events during a field campaign.<br/><br/>The study leverages from and complements the multi-institutional RELAMPAGO/CACTI effort. The observational and modeling work is approached from two perspectives. The first investigates how the land surface impacts the initiation and growth of convective precipitation (atmospheric perspective). The second investigates if changes in land cover have affected the hydrologic cycle and the probability of flooding in the basin (hydrology perspective). The impact of this work is threefold: it addresses fundamental scientific questions in hydrometeorology, drives improvements in fully-coupled hydrometeorological models and ultimately improves predictive skill of high impact weather events.<br/><br/>This work combines an integrated hydrometeorological field campaign and coupled modeling study using the WRF/WRF-Hydro system focused on the Carcara River basin in Argentina. This basin drains east from the Sierras de Cordoba, a mesoscale mountain range east of the Andes, toward the plains. Frequently impacted by severe, organized convection, the Carcara basin is ideally suited to perform observational and modeling studies aimed at understanding the role of the land surface in modulating the observed variability of intense convective systems and associated precipitation and flooding.<br/><br/>The overarching science question of this work is: What is the role of the land surface in modulating the observed variability of heavy precipitation and flooding in the Carcara River Basin? We address this overarching question with two subsidiary questions: <br/>1. How does land cover heterogeneity (including human-modified land cover) impact initiation and growth of convective precipitation at the local and meso-scale through land-atmosphere exchanges of moisture and energy?<br/>2. How have changes in land cover affected the partitioning of rainfall between infiltration/runoff and the residence times of soil moisture and groundwater in the Carcara Basin's terrestrial system?<br/><br/>The tools we will use are: a) Existing local observations of precipitation, water table depths and streamflow, b) Observations of precipitation, streamflow, soil moisture, temperature and surface fluxes measured by our team during the RELAMPAGO field campaign, c) Numerical simulations using the fully-coupled WRF/WRF-hydro modeling system both in offline mode (i.e. WRF-Hydro only, driven by observed meteorological conditions) and coupled (WRF/WRF-Hydro) modes. Our study region has many similarities with the Great Plains of the United States in terms of the importance of land-atmosphere interactions, the initiation and upscale growth of MCSs and the importance of low-level jet moisture transport. Hence, improved understanding of the hydrometeorology of MCSs will have far-reaching benefits beyond Argentina."

This will enable ?fingerprints? to be developed for each of the important sources to the atmosphere. Being able to identify the contribution of major sources of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere has broad implications for addressing environmental issues, such as the formation of smog and acid rain, and for air quality modeling and decision making associated with source reduction strategies. This research will be integrated with a multi-faceted education program to increase the participation of minorities in science research.<br/><br/>A new method has been developed to enable the measurement of nitrogen oxides (NOx) without having the samples subject to fractionation upon collection.  The method uses a solution of NaOH with KMnO4 that reacts with both NO and NO2 in the gas phase yielding nitrate in solution. The method has been tested in the PI?s laboratory and found to have a good level of reproducibility based upon repeated measures of standards and samples. A field deployable system is being developed by pairing this technique with a method to determine the fraction of isotopic 15N of the NOx.  The resulting characterization of NOx sources will enable tracing the sources of NOx for studies ranging from urban pollution to nitrogen fertilization in ecosystems."

The two SuperDARN radars, with a combined field-of-view exceeding 75 in azimuth centered on the magnetic meridian, will be capable of making measurements of the ionospheric electric field over a region that includes eastern North America, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and western Russia. Measurements in this sector, currently limited to the region north of 65 latitude, will extend the capabilities of the SuperDarn network to provide near real-time maps of the convection electric field during an expanded range of geomagnetic activity levels and increase the local time (LT) coverage to more than 12 hours. Existing radars at similar latitudes have demonstrated the importance of measurements from radars located at mid-latitudes during quiet to more active geomagnetic conditions and in particular, the ability of these radars to make detailed measurements of the sub-auroral polarization stream (SAPS) on rapid timescales (<1 min) over an extended range (>8 hours LT).  The installation of the two SuperDarn radars in Ireland would make possible investigations of longitudinal differences associated with the South Atlantic Anomaly in SAPS and electric field structuring as well as conjugate studies with southern hemisphere radars. In line with the geospace community review panel recommendations, distributed networks of ground-based instruments are quite valuable in resolving space-time ambiguities associated with sparse measurements of the space environment and making progress toward the science goals of the Solar Wind-Magnetosphere Interactions. The Ireland radars will significantly increase measurements of the electric field at mid-latitudes enabling SuperDARN to provide real-time observations of space weather disturbances in the ionosphere extending from Asia, across North America and into Northern Europe.  This should result in significant progress toward the larger goal of providing the capability to predict the effects of solar variability on the environment and on society.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the proposed project is the calibration of SuperDARN elevation angle measurements which can be used to improve the geolocation of backscattered signals, to discriminate between propagation modes and to estimate the index of refraction at the scattering location - this is now normally done by modeling using ray tracing software, and such models might be in error at times.<br/>The project includes a small augmentation that will enable one of the interferometer arrays to be configurable and allow for testing of the sensitivity and accuracy of SuperDARN interferometers. Ireland is ideally situated for interferometer testing with two Scandinavian ionospheric heating facilities providing a calibration source within the field-of-view of the augmented radar. The project would very efficiently reuse most of a ready-to-go radar system that for various logistical and political reasons never got installed in the Azores. This is a highly targeted re-purposed application that minimizes substantially the installation budget."

Water-limited arid and semiarid cities are experiencing disproportionate increases in population and land transformation worldwide, increasing stress on water resources and altering natural hydrological systems. Cities face significant challenges in providing clean water for municipal and industrial uses and in managing the environmental water quality and flooding risks that accompany urbanization. The growth of cities will require a continuing investment in infrastructure and in new strategies to adapt to water resource limitations. In the face of demographic and global change, the sustainability of water resources in arid and semiarid cities will be a key challenge. Addressing this challenge will require improved understanding of how water availability and distribution changes with urbanization, and how these changes affect ecosystem service provision and policy responses. Policy and governance decisions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services related to water resources need to be based on scientific evidence to be effective. However, better science does not necessarily lead to better governance; there remains a gap between scientific knowledge and the actions taken as a result of this knowledge. The objective of this project is to improve understanding of the linkages between ecosystem services and governance of water resources.   <br/><br/>This project will study the natural and human components of semi-arid cities in the US Southwest in order to determine if various attributes of these urbanized systems encourage learning and action that lead to more sustainable outcomes. This research will draw on theoretical frameworks that explicitly link ecological structure and function to ecosystem services to information flows to decision making. Specifically, four key questions will be addressed: (a) How does the frequency, intensity and redistribution of rainfall and runoff influence the eco-hydrologic response of arid and semi-arid urbanized systems and result in emergent ecosystem services? (b) How do human system conditions affect city-level learning about actions that influence ecosystem service provision? (c) How do natural system conditions influence social networks, understanding, and decision-making about water management and infrastructure? And (d) What actions have been taken, in terms of alterations to the built environment, that influence the effect of the built environment on natural system processes? These questions will be answered through a set of field, survey, lab, workshop, and synthetic experiments. Specifically a suite of research sites will be established in Tucson, Sierra Vista, and Yuma, Arizona that will allow investigations from the 1 ha/individual to the 100,000 ha/regional scales. Natural system investigations will focus on how eco-hydrologic processes integrate from the point to large catchment scale and characterize ecosystem services. The social dimensions of this project will focus on the policy and governance sectors to understand learning, decision-making and action at the municipal scale and importantly across social and bioclimatic regions. This work will integrate across natural and human systems by examining how scientific information about ecosystem services develops into decision making and by investigating how policy interventions impact ecosystem services."

The NSF-supported HIPPO campaign previously demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of the tomographic sampling used in the design of the ATom mission.  In addition to the study of short-lived climate forcing agents, this project includes global-scale measurements that can advance other fundamental aspects of carbon and climate science, such as understanding the distribution of carbon sinks and the links between ocean biochemistry, carbon cycling, and climate change. <br/><br/>The NASA-supported ATom project consists of four deployments in order to map distributions in all seasons. The instrument packages to be deployed include the Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2), which provides rapid in situ measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, and a flask sampler that collects samples for analysis of O2/N2, CO2 concentration, CO2 isotopes and Ar/N2.  By combining these measurements with large-scale atmospheric transport models, direct constraints on the corresponding air-sea fluxes of heat, O2, and CO2 are obtained.  Atmospheric O2 measurements can reveal the vertical and latitudinal extent of hemispheric seasonal ocean O2 outgassing and in-gassing signals and define spatial gradients at enough times in the seasonal cycle to derive climatological annual-mean distributions."

The processes of interest are related to perturbations that propagate upward from the lower atmosphere as well as to solar radiation and particle inputs from above.

The work has educational broader impacts both for the broad audience of game players, many of whom may have limited interest in traditional STEM classwork, and for the cross-disciplinary team of undergraduate students who develop the game.<br/><br/>The scientific focus of the project is the lapse rate feedback, in which changes in the way temperature varies with height affect the total amount of warming that occurs for a given increase in carbon dioxide (CO2).  In the tropics the warming is top heavy, with greater temperature increases at upper levels, and the greater warming aloft helps the atmosphere cool to space more effectively to balance the heat trapping effect of the CO2.  But the polar caps typically warm more near the surface, in part due to reductions in ice and snow cover which expose the darker land and sea surface below. This bottom heavy warming requires a greater temperature increase to balance the CO2 increase than would be required if the warming were distributed equally at all levels, thus it contributes to polar amplification.<br/><br/>The logic of the polar lapse rate feedback is sound and the effect has been demonstrated in models, but the strength of the feedback is unclear.  One consideration is that energy transport into the polar caps could work against bottom-heaviness given that much of the transport occurs aloft. But the net effect of energy transport is unclear as the transport of dry static energy is expected to decrease with warming while latent energy increases as the air becomes more moist. Low cloud changes due to near-surface warming may also reduce the warming effect of the polar lapse rate feedback.  These effects are examined through simulations using a hierarchy of models at varying levels of complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing of onset can vary considerably from year to year, thus skillful onset predictions would be valuable for agricultural planning.  But the predictability of Spring onset, and the processes that lead to year-to-year differences in onset date, are not well known. Research conducted here addresses both issues.  <br/><br/>The onset is clearly linked to local meteorological factors such as sunlight, warmth, and rainfall, but preliminary work by the PI and collaborators suggests that onset indicators such as the leaf-out of lilacs have greater predictability than the associated meteorological variables.  The predictability of such phenological indicators based on the observational record is thus a focus of the research. The predictability of the associated meteorological conditions is also a target of the research, addressed using long-range forecasts from the National Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project. Onset predictability is further analyzed through a new crowdsourced retrospective forecasting project, in which the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is configured for personal computers and disseminated to local high school students.  Students create WRF forecasts using different versions of the model physics, thereby accounting for uncertainties inherent in the forecast model. Further work on ensemble prediction compares ensemble forecast skill to a baseline provided by a simple empirical linear inverse model (LIM).  The LIM comparison determines the advantage of using complex nonlinear forecast models over statistical methods based on past behavior, and tests the hypothesis that the predictable dynamics of the transition are essentially linear.<br/><br/>The changes in local meteorology that control the timing of leaf-out and other phenology are in turn controlled by a reorganization of the large-scale atmospheric circulation that occurs rapidly in Spring.  In particular, the splitting and northward migration of the jet stream over the central and eastern Pacific have been identified as a key factor.  The dynamics of the jet transition are examined using a hierarchy of models of varying degrees of complexity, including a global atmospheric model with prescribed realistic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), the same model with the landmasses removed and simplified sea surface temperatures, and a linear baroclinic model.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER award involves the use of WRF as a tool for teaching weather and climate science to students in 20 regional high schools.  The PI works with the Paleontological Research Institution's Museum of the Earth (MoE) to conduct training workshops for teachers on the use of the WRF model as a teaching tool. The workshops emphasizes learning by doing, interactively showing the teachers how their students can set up and run the model, make daily forecasts for nearby weather stations, and validate the forecasts the following day.  In addition, the educational activities are an integral part of the research activity, as the WRF forecasts produced by the students are collected into ensembles used for research on spring onset predictability.  Aside from the educational broader impacts, the research has broader impacts due to the potential value of skillful predictions of spring onset, which would benefit farmers and other decision makers in the agricultural sector.  The project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc and summer support for an undergraduate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by<br/>developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project targets two aspects of supercell storms that are notoriously difficult to simulate and observe: (1) the influence of the buoyancy field and its horizontal gradients and (2) the influence of the underlying surface.  The observational and numerical modeling methods are innovative and have the potential to be transformative, not only in the severe storms community, but in other scientific communities as well.  This work will address a long-standing, critical need in the severe storms community, obtaining fine-scale 3D thermodynamic observations within storms? The PIs will also develop a permanent exhibit at a local, non-profit museum educating the public on severe storms, which will be a valuable contribution to the community. Historically, the PIs have been involved in a broad range of outreach activities, including K-12 and public education, the participation as science advisors for government groups and media, and publishing articles accessible to a broad audience. <br/><br/>The PIs plan to undertake the following tasks: 1) sample supercell storms using pseudo-Lagrangian drifters and 2) use improved turbulence methods to study frictionally generated vorticity; both approaches are novel and creative.  The use of pseudo-Lagrangian drifters to observe the 3D structure of the boundary layer surrounding and within supercells, capable of obtaining observations within the most dangerous and critical parts of the storm with minimal safety risks to the observer, is novel.   This new observational tool will be used to obtain quasi-Lagrangian observations of wind and thermodynamic characteristics in the boundary layer extending into the core of the supercell, including in the cold pools which have been shown to be critical in developing sufficient near surface streamwise vorticity for tornadogenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."

This mission, which is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018, will visit the near-Sun regions never explored before by any spacecraft, providing groundbreaking in-situ and close-by remote sensing measurements of the inner heliosphere between 9.5 and 55 solar radii (measured from the center of the Sun), reaching up to six times closer than the Helios mission.  This five-year CAREER project is aimed at improving present understanding of the evolution and structure of turbulence close to the Sun.  The project will also help elucidate how energy is transported from the solar surface to its upper atmosphere and how this energy is dissipated to heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind.  One of the main broader impacts of this project is that it will enhance the scientific return of the PSP mission by laying the theoretical foundations for interpretation of PSP measurements, which will have repercussions in a number of other outstanding questions in heliospheric physics.  The project team will introduce a novel and user friendly software tool that will allow students to use numerical simulations, with minimal knowledge of scientific computing, to enhance learning of introductory space plasma physics.  The role that numerical simulations will play in the introductory courses will closely mirror the role that simulations play in modern plasma research, i.e., to facilitate understanding of the underlying physics when analytical progress is no longer possible.  The software interface will allow students to quickly solve numerical problems to gain intuition from the numerical solution to help reinforce understanding of the underlying concepts.  Another main broader impact of this project is that, at its conclusion, a fully tested and working version of this tool will be made available online under the GNU open-source license, to allow for the expansion of its plasma physics problems base and use in other research institutions.  This software tool will also be adapted to disseminate with the general public the research outcomes of this project, and inform them on the relevance of space plasma research and the revolutionary discoveries that the PSP will enable in the decades to come.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This CAREER is expected to provide an improved understanding of the origin and evolution of turbulence in the near-Sun environment, from the Alfven waves observed in the low corona to turbulent fluctuations in the upper corona and the solar wind.  This investigation will combine theory, high-resolution numerical simulations and existing observations to lay the groundwork for the interpretation of the unprecedented measurements by the PSP.  The project aims to accomplish the following specific science goals: (i) Investigate how turbulence evolves from AW motions in the solar corona to fully developed AW turbulence at larger heliocentric distances; (ii) identify scaling laws governing the inertial-range power spectrum, the role of cross- helicity and residual energy in the turbulence and how such properties depend on the heliocentric distance; (iii) investigate the role that this turbulence plays in power laws of the magnetic energy spectrum of fluctuations observed by Helios measurements between 0.3 AU and 0.4 AU; and, (iv) establish predictions of the properties of turbulent fluctuations that the PSP will measure.  This CAREER investigation is also timely, because it will lay the theoretical and numerical framework needed for interpretation of the PSP signals before the first measurements become available at the end of 2018.  The outcome of this research combined with the future PSP observations will not only contribute to expand our knowledge of the fundamentals of Alfvenic turbulence in this region, but will lead to transformative advances towards determining the viability of Alfvenic turbulence as a major mechanism for the heating of the corona and the acceleration of the solar wind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the funded research is to investigate the climatology, seasonality, and their interactions with background flows of a variety of extreme weather events that impact parts of the United States, Central America, and the Western Caribbean. Candidate extreme weather events to be investigated include heavy, flood-producing rainstorms during the cooler half of the year and tropical disturbances that can bring flooding rains, damaging winds, and devastating storm surges during the warmer half of the year. These candidate extreme weather events often occur in conjunction with upper tropospheric disturbances known as cutoff cyclones.  Cutoff cyclones that form in higher latitudes can dump chilly air into the subtropics, fueling cold waves initially and big rainstorms subsequently.  Cutoff cyclones that form in lower latitudes can enable warm, moist tropical air to reach midlatitudes, fueling tropical cyclone landfalls and/or exceptionally heavy rainfalls.  A novel aspect of the research is that it is targeted at the interaction of tropical and midlatitude circulations associated with cutoff cyclones.  These cutoff cyclones can govern the timing, occurrence, and location of extreme weather events in the United States, Central America, and western Caribbean. Another innovation of this research project is that historically extreme weather events have been studied in isolation.  This historical approach precludes the possibility of detecting the occurrence of multiple geographically separated but dynamically linked extreme weather events that may be occurring near simultaneously in different parts of the world.  A sure-fire recipe for the occurrence of extreme weather events is the existence of a wavy, high-amplitude, large-scale flow pattern across the Northern Hemisphere that can break down into a series of cutoff cyclones.  A critical science issue is determining the physical causes of flow breakdown that can lead to cutoff cyclone formation.  The research project will use state-of-the-art global gridded datasets to identify the frequency of extreme weather events associated with cutoff cyclones.  Climatological, composite, and case study analyses will be constructed from these gridded datasets to help quantify the physical processes governing the location and occurrence of these extreme weather events.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research are substantial, including (1) the education of the next generation of scientists in the field, (2) opportunities to interact with scientists at NOAA's National Hurricane Center to facilitate the transfer of research to operations, and (3) educating meteorologists from Central America and the Caribbean through outreach and training activities to ensure they are current on weather patterns conducive to the occurrence of extreme weather events in their regions."

A similar but weaker monsoon circulation exists over North America.  Monsoon storms also transport water and human-produced pollutants to great altitudes.  These pollutants can have major effects on the chemistry of the atmosphere, including the stratospheric ozone layer, which protects living things from harmful solar radiation.

The models are designed to be only as complex as necessary to capture the phenomena of interest, which are assumed to be manifestations of fundamental climate system processes.  One such model is the Held-Suarez model (HS, named for its creators), which does not include clouds or moist processes and uses thermal relaxation to generate the temperature contrast between the equator and the poles.  Despite its simplicity the model reproduces many features of the atmospheric circulation including jet streams, reasonable approximations of middle-latitude weather systems, and the tropical overturning circulations known as Hadley cells.<br/><br/>One use of the HS model is to test the hypothesis that key aspects of the atmospheric circulation, including the vigor of kinetic energy generation and the amount of heat transported from warmer to colder latitudes, can be understood in terms of Maximum Entropy Production (MEP).  MEP can be used to derive an upper bound on kinetic energy generation in the HS model, but the upper bound is too large to be useful unless constraints are imposed which make it dependent on planetary rotation rate and other fundamental parameters.  Research conducted here attempts to identify the appropriate constraints in the HS model and assess their relevance for more sophisticated models and the observed atmosphere. Other problems to be addressed include the role of lower tropospheric wave momentum fluxes in stormtrack dynamics, wave instabilities that transport westerly momentum from the middle latitudes into the tropics, and generation mechanisms for external Rossby waves.<br/><br/>Additional problems are addressed with the HS model by incorporating a simplified representation of the hydrological cycle in which water vapor is treated as a passive tracer without radiative effects.  Surface evaporation proceeds according to a standard bulk formula and water vapor condenses when it saturates at higher and colder altitudes.  But the condensation does not result in clouds or latent heating and water cycling has no effect on atmospheric circulation.  Despite these omissions the model produces water vapor streamers, frontal precipitation patterns, and atmospheric rivers which resemble their real-world counterparts.  The model is used here to study kinematic constraints on the mean strength of the hydrological cycle and its response over continents to warmer conditions.  For the latter application continents are specified using a simplified ""bucket"" representation of soil moisture.<br/><br/>Further research is conducted with a model at a somewhat higher level of complexity, which uses simplified atmospheric radiative transfer (the grey-body approximation) rather than thermal relaxation to produce the pole-to-equator temperature contrast.  The model allows the hydrological cycle to affect circulation through condensational heating, but water vapor has no effect on radiative transfer and clouds are not represented.  This version of the model is used to study the behavior of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the narrow band of clouds and precipitation usually found near the equator.  One strategy is to modify the model so that it represents only a limited zonal sector of the atmosphere, so that disturbances of the ITCZ caused by phenomena larger than the width of the sector are eliminated.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts through the sharing of model codes and documentation with the research community through a web portal.  Versions of the models have already gained broad acceptance as research tools, but they have been disseminated largely through personal connections with the PIs' research group.  Beyond their value for isolating and examining specific climate system processes, the models have proven useful for testing numerical methods used in comprehensive climate models.  In addition, the models can play an important role in communicating climate science to the public and researchers in other scientific fields.  Simple models are valuable for this purpose as they can be used to demonstrate that the simplifications required for effective communication correctly represent, albeit in approximate form, the workings of the climate system.  The project also provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for workforce development in this research area."

Reducing these model biases is one of the more pertinent and challenging aspects of modern climate science as a means to provide strategies to meet the future needs in food, water, energy, and biological diversity.<br/><br/>Currently, there is a lack a consistent understanding of precisely how sensitive local rainfall variability in central China is to regional perturbations in the Asian monsoon because knowledge of the monsoon in central East Asia principally relies upon oxygen-isotope records which, according to new research, may not necessarily reflect local hydroclimate.  Therefore, this project aims to build a more complete picture of local rainfall variability in central-eastern China by addressing the following questions: (1) Can speleothem proxies, such as trace elements (Magnesium, Strontium, Barium) be used to deconvolve regional atmospheric circulation from local hydrology in East Asia. If so, (2) what do these alterative proxies inform us about local hydroclimate in central-eastern China and what are the mechanisms to explain the proxy-inferred changes. (3) How well do the proxy reconstructions match the paleo-simulations from coupled general circulation models (CGCMs). <br/><br/>The main objectives of the project include: (1) reconstruct local hydrology in central-eastern China during Heinrich events 1-6 utilizing speleothem trace elements and isotope ratios from a suite of well-dated speleothems from four caves located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; (2) delineate the mechanisms for the hydrologic patterns observed in the proxies using the Community Earth System Model CGCM simulations; and (3) conduct model-proxy syntheses in space and time by directly comparing speleothem pseudoproxy time series--constructed using climate model output coupled with Proxy System Models (PSMs)--with measured isotope profiles.<br/><br/>To address the above objectives the researchers aim to test the following hypotheses: (1) Despite a weakened Indian monsoon, central China was wetter during Heinrich events thereby challenging the longstanding paradigm that the East Asian Monsoon (EASM) became weaker during North Atlantic (NA) cooling; (2) The higher rainfall in central-eastern China can best be explained by a seasonally-lagged onset of the mei-yu stage of monsoon evolution. A later onset of mei-yu to midsummer during NA cooling would have resulted in a shorter midsummer stage, leaving south-central China wet at the expense of dry conditions to the north; (3) Vegetation demise and subsequent higher dust emissions from the Sahara/Sahel regions during Heinrich events, affected the position of the ITCZ and thus amplified the response outlined in hypothesis (2); (4) Comparison of speleothem pseudoproxy time series (generated from PSMs) with measured records from East Asia will help to identify the dominant controls on speleothem delta 18-Oxygen.  It may also allow a more robust assessment of model skill and help to better evaluate any model-proxy biases through abrupt climate change events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these models lagged correlations are used to identify pathways of causal influence among components of a coupled system, and the model is constructed by representing each component as one node of a directed graph.  Edges between node are assigned values representing the extent to which one component is predictable given prior knowledge of another.  A key issue in causal discovery is accounting for indirect effects, in which component A influences component B which in turn influences component C, as opposed to the case in which component A directly influences component C.  In graphical terms the distinction is whether or not an edge exists between A and C, or whether A's connection to C is only through B. This evaluation is done through a statistical calculation of conditional probabilities.   Previous work by the PIs applied causal discovery to identify relationships among four well-known teleconnection patterns, the Western Pacific and Eastern Pacific Oscillations (WPO and EPO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific/North America (PNA) pattern.  In this case the method shows that the EPO can affect the NAO 18 days later, while the NAO can influence the PNA pattern three to six days later. Although the application to atmospheric science is novel, the method has been used successfully in other disciplines including economics, systems engineering, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Work under the project will further develop the modeling technique, with a goal of increasing computational speed by a factor of 100 through improvements in parallelization and localization of memory access.  Visualization tools will also be developed to display results.  In addition to these development efforts, the PIs will apply the technique to address three topics in climate dynamics: the onset dynamics of the Asian summer monsoon, the subseasonal variation of the Northern Hemisphere annual mode (NAM), and changes in the characteristics of information flow in global warming simulations.  Work on monsoon onset will focus on three questions: What are the critical processes responsible for the establishment of the cross-equatorial flow? How important is the mechanical and thermal forcing associated with the Tibetan Plateau for the onset compared to local air-sea interaction in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea? Is the onset a direct manifestation of atmospheric instability?  For subseasonal NAM variability, the research goal is to investigate the relative importance of tropospheric dynamics, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and troposphere-surface coupling in determining the phase transition of the NAM.  The work on global warming is based on a preliminary analysis of one simulation in which information flows in the Northern midlatitudes become weaker as the climate warms, suggesting a reduction in atmospheric predictability in the tropics and mid-latitudes.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through the introduction of a methodology developed in one scientific discipline (economics) into another (climate dynamics).  The PIs will promote the adoption of the modeling technique by making their algorithms and software available to the community of climate dynamics researchers through a web portal.  They will also offer tutorials at scientific conferences including the annual meetings of the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union.  Tutorial materials will also be made available online and through published papers.  In addition, the project will support and train a graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

As the grid boxes are typically tens of kilometers wide or more it is not possible to represent individual clouds, or even cloud systems, in such models.  Instead the net effect of clouds and other small-scale processes on the larger scale atmospheric flow must be approximated through the use of parameterizations, and this representation is a key source of errors in weather forecasts and uncertainty in future climate change projections. Alternative methods of representing clouds and their interactions with large-scale atmospheric conditions are therefore desirable for forecasting the weather and providing decision support to stakeholders concerned with the impacts of climate variability and change.<br/><br/>This award supports the development and testing of  a novel atmospheric model, the global quasi-3D Multiscale Modeling Framework (Q3D MMF). The model is an extension of the Super-Parameterizaton (SP) scheme developed by the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes (CMMAP, see AGS-0425247), the Science and Technology Center (STC).  The SP MMF consists of a global atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) in which the parameterizations for cloud processes and other subgrid-scale processes in each grid column are replaced by a high-resolution cloud resolving model (CRM). CMMAP has already produced an SP version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, or SP-CAM for the SP version). But SP-CAM uses a two-dimensional (2D) CRM in which the domain is a vertical plane oriented in either the zonal (x-) or meridional (y-) direction and periodic boundary conditions in the x- or y-direction. These restrictions are imposed to reduce computational cost, and to relax them entirely would require a global CRM (GCRM) which is too computationally expensive for most purposes. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the Q3D MMF partially relaxes the conditions by using CRMs with domains that are narrow channels with only a few gridpoints in the cross-channel domain. The channels connect with their counterparts in neighboring cells of the GCM, thus avoiding periodic boundary conditions at either end of the channel. Moreover, each grid cell of the GCM has two such channel-shaped CRMs, oriented in the zonal and meridional direction, to allow for directional anisotropy due to surface topography and other factors.The zonal and meridional CRM channels thus extend around the globe without interruption and intersect each other at adjacent grid cells of the parent GCM. The channel models do not interact at the intersections, as that would result in unphysical behavior associated with a cross-shaped domain. The separate CRM channels communicate only with the GCM, receiving background information from the GCM and supplying the GCM with the outputs expected from standard grid column parameterizations found in conventional GCMs.  Work here is an extension of previous work at CMMAP, including the development of a simpler version in which the CRMs are embedded in a regional model over an idealized tropical domain.  Work under this award includes several tasks required to develop a global model from this prototype, including inclusion of topography and conversion from a periodic Cartesian domain to a realistic GCM domain.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts for the research community because it develops a new atmospheric model which is applicable to a range of research areas related to the impact of clouds on large-scale weather and climate phenomena.  To ensure accessibility to the broader research community, the Q3D MMF will be constructed using a version of CAM (the spectral element version) as the GCM component.

The RH of the air is largely determined by the coldest temperature it encounters during in-cloud ascent, as condensation dries the air to the saturation moisture value given by its temperature (lower moisture content for colder air).  But other factors also influence the RH of the subsiding subtropical air, in particular the air can be moistened by mixing with air from more humid levels closer to the surface.

Well-developed hurricanes display a relatively high degree of geometrical organization in their core region, with a central cloud-free eye surrounded by an approximate ring of clouds, called the eyewall, where the most intense surface winds are found.  Existing theories for hurricane structure have exploited this geometric organization in the framework of axial symmetric circulation and these approaches have provided useful insights into this destructive phenomenon.  This funded project aims to gain a better understanding of the roles of axial asymmetries or ""eddy"" processes in the intensification of tropical cyclones. This research project will focus on the dynamics and thermodynamics of eddy processes in hurricanes using an integrated, multi-pronged evaluation of the internal eddy processes during the intensification stage of tropical storms. Specifically, the PIs will conduct diagnostic analyses to evaluate the impact of the eddy structures on the axial symmetric component of tropical storms by employing conventional Eulerian analyses and a new analysis method based on Lagrangian coherent structures. Lagrangian coherent structures help identify structures within the wind flow that tend to separate the flow into distinct regions. These regions will aid in the identification of momentum and heat transport by the eddies.  High resolution computer simulation will be the foundational tool in this study, and the ability to resolve and analyze the important eddies at different computer resolutions will be investigated.<br/><br/>This research is of interest to atmospheric science, fluid dynamics and dynamical system communities.  The determination of the manifold roles of various eddy phenomena on the mean hurricane structure is of high intellectual merit.  Improved characterization of the effects of eddies on the wind structure and intensity of hurricanes will serve as useful guidance in the development of future parameterizations. Since operational models do not well resolve these fine-scale features, the improved understanding of the importance of eddy processes for the rapid intensification of tropical storms would help further increase the skill in predicting the substantial hazard posed by hurricanes."

Moreover, there will be plenty of opportunities to introduce aerosol radiative forcing and remote sensing as real examples in undergraduate and graduate geoscience courses to help students to improve their research techniques and develop their theses and dissertation topics.<br/><br/>Aerosols have cooling effect on climate system through reflecting solar radiation. At the same time, some aerosols e.g. black carbon, can absorb solar radiation, which cools the surface but warms the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on radiation, the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), impact the radiative balance through the direct radiative effects of aerosols and indirect radiative effects on cloud properties and precipitation. To estimate aerosol effects on radiative forcing, knowing information about vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial since the vertical distribution of aerosols has a significant effect on the sign of radiative forcing. This research will develop a new aerosol vertical distribution retrieval algorithm which can take advantage of broad ceilometer networks on aerosol vertical distribution observations. Then the variability of aerosol vertical distributions and the impacts on radiative forcing and heating rate profile will be investigated. The investigated climate regions include areas of rural, suburban-urban, urban, urban-dust and ocean areas from mid-latitude to tropics. This research will investigate three scientific questions: (1) What are the characteristics of aerosol vertical distributions at different regions and seasons?

The information of aerosol vertical distribution is needed to quantify the effects of aerosols on radiative forcing and how these in turn influence climate and the hydrological cycle. This study will enhance our understanding of aerosol vertical distributions though a new retrieval algorithm. It will improve the study of aerosol direct effects on radiative forcing as well as the indirect effects due to aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction.

Organic constituents of aerosols are ubiquitous but their formation properties are not well understood.  Aqueous-phase processes are known to affect the composition of the atmospheric multiphase systems and are an important pathway for secondary aerosol formation.  However non-idealities due to organic aerosol-water interactions and processes in cloud droplets are complex; current models do not reproduce observations in the laboratory or field.  The principal investigator (PI) will develop a unique measurement capability to investigate secondary aerosol formation and particle ageing via cloud processing in both the laboratory and field.  Ambient or artificially generated aerosols will be sampled and characterized for number size distributions with a scanning mobility particle analyzer and chemical composition with a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer both before and after processing through a continuous flow stream-wise thermal gradient chamber.  The fractions of particles that are activated to cloud-condensation-nuclei (CCN) as a function of supersaturation and corresponding changes in volatility, surface tension, and other properties of aerosols that result from cloud processing will be measured.  Methods to separate and characterize interstitial aerosol and activated droplets and to recycle processed aerosols through the CCN chamber will be developed.  Results based on this measurement capability will fill critical gaps in understanding of the chemical evolution of aerosol scavenged in cloud droplets.  The PI and her students will leverage existing facilities at a state-of-the art air pollution laboratory at the University of California, Riverside Bourns College of Engineering- Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT).  This facility will also provide opportunities for her research team to interact with the broader research community.<br/><br/>The research will address important questions and advance knowledge in air quality, climate, and health.  The new measurement capability will be incorporated into the long-term research plans of an early-career PI from an underrepresented group in the geosciences.  As a faculty member at one of the most ethnically and economically diverse public research institutions in the United States, the PI will act as a role model and mentor to students from a broad range of backgrounds.  The PI will develop an integrated research and education program based on supervisory, situational, and informal mentoring techniques targeting graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.  Graduate students will be supported through participation in the research effort and will disseminate findings at scientific conferences and via reviewed publications.  The project will also fund two undergraduate research fellowships, one of which would target students from educationally and/or economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  The PI will continue her current research-mentoring relationships with local high school and underrepresented students. Finally, through collaboration with the California Science Project, the PI will offer 5-day summer workshops for K-12 teachers with a focus on climate change."

To determine small-scale flow structures, all seven of the Fabry-Perot spectrometers now in Alaska will be configured to focus their attention simultaneously onto one small geographic region roughly coinciding with the field of view of the PFISR radar. These instruments will simultaneously monitor thermospheric temperatures and wind vectors, producing two-dimensional maps of temperatures and 3-component vector winds, with a spatial resolution of around 80 km. The array will operate in this mode for three campaigns each lasting around two-months.<br/> To quantify the importance of small-scale eddies and waves in the thermosphere, the project will address three focused science questions: (1) What is the occurrence frequency, intensity, spectral distribution, and overall morphology of the small-scale eddies and waves in Alaska?s auroral thermosphere, for both quiet and active conditions? (2) Is it possible to identify the driver mechanisms and source regions for these small-scale features, based on timing of their occurrence relative to other measurements, the spatial alignment of their phase fronts, and the directions in which they?re propagating? (3) Is it possible to estimate the momentum flux and dissipation rates of these waves, based on the amplitudes, periods, and horizontal & vertical wavelengths of the temperature and 3-component wind perturbations, and on the time evolution of these quantities?

This project uses climate models, particularly the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to examine the potential consequences of injecting sulfate into the stratosphere to produce reflecting aerosols, mimicking the effect of large volcanic eruptions. The award is a continuation of previous work by the PI under AGS-1157525.<br/><br/>Previous work by the PI and others raised concerns that stratospheric geoengineering would result in a reduction in monsoon rainfall, with negative impacts on tropical agriculture. Here the PI proposes that the negative impacts could be mitigated using a geoengineering technique that preferentially cools the Southern Hemisphere ocean.  The idea is based on research suggesting that cooling the Southern Hemisphere pushes the intertropical convergence zone northward, thereby causing preferentially greater amounts of rainfall in Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions.  Numerical experiments to test this idea would be conducted by artificially altering ocean surface albedo in CESM simulations.<br/><br/>A second topic pursued here is the effect of stratospheric sulfate injection on terrestrial vegetation and agriculture.  Previous work using vegetation models embedded in climate models suggests a small reduction in photosynthesis due to stratospheric aerosol injection, in part because scattering of sunlight by stratospheric aerosols increases diffuse surface insolation at the expense of direct sunlight (in addition to reducing total sunlight reaching the ground).  But other effects could be important, in particular the increase in ultraviolet (UV) sunlight due to the reduction of stratospheric ozone as a consequences of aerosol injection (an effect seen following volcanic eruptions).  The impact of increased UV on agricultural production  is studied through the use of the Community Land Model (CLM), the land surface component model of CESM, using the CLM-Crop version which allows representation of agricultural crops.  Some of the effort is devoted to developing CLM-Crop to include more crops and represent processes relevant to the UV impact.<br/><br/>In addition to the work with CESM, the project also supports the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), a coordinated international project in which multiple climate modeling centers perform a specified set of simulations, so that the range of possible outcomes can be assessed.  The project supports annual workshops for GeoMIP participants, and is also launching an intercomparison project for crop model simulations of the agricultural impacts of geoengineering.  The crop model intercomparison effort is organized under the existing Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) initiative.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project stem from the need for studies such as this one to inform policy makers and the public regarding the potential costs and benefits of geoengineering schemes. In addition, the proposed developments to CLM-Crop will provide an enhanced resource for the research community. The project support a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future climate science workforce."

Tropical precipitation biases have been attributed to poor cumulus parameterizations, ocean coupling feedbacks, ocean eddy mixing deficiencies, land-atmosphere interaction, and remote effects of insufficient low clouds. Sources of error will be separated by looking at the initial development of the biases over the first decade of simulations.<br/><br/>Cumulus parameterization errors develop within days to weeks, local ocean coupling errors develop in months, and the remote effect of midlatitude low cloud biases may take years to affect tropical precipitation. This initial rainfall and SST bias development will be used to test improvements to the cloud microphysical parameterizations in CESM and SP-CESM, as well as changes to the cumulus parameterization in CESM. Changes affecting Southern Hemisphere midlatitude low cloud cover will be a focus.

In this study, processes that lead to the rapid formation of the upper-tropospheric warm core in TCs will be explored through on idealized and real-case simulations and diagnostic and budget analyses using cloud-resolving models.  In particular, the following three scientific questions will be addressed:<br/>1) Given favorable tropical ocean conditions, is the intensification rate of a TC externally or internally determined and can an environmental flow or synoptic-scale forcing increase the intensification rate that a TC could have without these forcing?<br/>2) How do the three-dimensional (3D) structure (including the size) and intensity of a TC vortex determine the efficiency of the upper-tropospheric warming and thus the intensification rate of the TC itself?<br/>3) How are convective bursts and hot towers triggered and how do they lead to the upper tropospheric warming over the storm core prior to and during the RI?<br/><br/>To answer these questions, we will use the TC model (TCM4) developed by the PI and the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to conduct a series of idealized and real-case simulations and perform diagnostic and budget analyses to verify our hypotheses, identify the physical mechanisms responsible for the RI. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Results from this research will improve our understanding of the dynamics of the RI of tropical cyclones and factors that determine the potential intensification rate of a TC.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The research will lead to a set of parameters/factors that determine the potential intensification rate of tropical cyclones.

The trend is generally regarded as a consequence of increasing temperature, as for the same relative humidity warmer air holds more precipitable water than colder air. Apart from the trend, EPI shows similar variation during weather-related temperature fluctuations between warm and cold days, as extreme precipitation events on colder days tend to be less intense than their counterparts on warmer days.  But in day-to-day temperature fluctuations the increase of EPI with temperature only holds up to a point, beyond which intensity falls off with further increases in temperature.  It is thus of interest to understand why EPI increases with temperature up to a threshold value and then decreases in day-to-day variability, what determines the temperature at which EPI peaks, and how the EPI-temperature relationship changes as a result of long-term increases in temperature.<br/><br/>The PI hypothesizes that the reduction in EPI at the highest temperatures is a consequence of the effect of temperature on the moisture difference between air in convective clouds and the ambient air surrounding them.  Rising air in convective clouds is generally saturated with water vapor while ambient air surrounding the clouds is not, thus the vigor of clouds is suppressed when drier ambient air is mixed into them.  The suppressing effect of ambient air mixed into clouds increases with temperature if the moisture difference between cloud and ambient air increases with temperature, an increase which is expected under reasonable assumptions including a minimal change in ambient relative humidity.  Work under this award examines the role of this moisture deficit mechanism in suppressing the development of deep convective clouds from shallow clouds, thereby reducing extreme precipitation at high temperatures.  The work also considers the change in the EPI-temperature relationship that occurs as climate warms, with the hypothesis that the relationship remains qualitatively the same but the threshold value shifts to progressively higher temperatures.  Additional work considers the possible implications of the moisture deficit mechanism for drought.  The work is carried out through a combination of observational analysis and climate model simulations.<br/><br/>The project has broader impacts due to the severe consequences of extreme precipitation for human activities and the need to understand how the threats posed by extreme precipitation will evolve in a changing climate.  The PI is also engaged in a variety of outreach activities at local schools, including a 5-day workshop for middle- and high-school math and science teachers.  In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher, thereby providing for the development of the workforce in this research area."

Many aspects of cumulus convection are affected by entrainment, the process by which turbulent clouds introduce dry air from outside the cloud.  Entrainment results in the dilution of the cloud which decreases the updraft speed and cloud height, and potentially prevents precipitation formation.  This award will provide funding for the systematic investigation of entrainment in storms that occur in regions with environmental wind shear, the conditions that can sustain supercell thunderstorms.  The researcher plans to develop general relationships between wind shear, cumulus entrainment, and convective precipitation which can be used to improve prediction of thunderstorm initiation, and rain, hail and lightning that form within these storms.  In addition, the project will contribute to the development of two early-career researchers who will be trained in atmospheric science and high performance computing.<br/><br/>Prior research on cumulus entrainment has largely not taken wind shear into consideration.  This project will use the CM1 cloud model to address three main hypotheses:  1) Unidirectional vertical wind shear enhances entrainment (compared to the non-sheared case) into a cloud updraft in its thermal-like stage, but directional vertical wind shear decreases this enhancement, 2) In environments with sufficiently strong vertical wind shear to generate a rotating updraft, the thermal-like initial updraft transforms into a jet-like updraft, decreasing the entrainment into, and dilution of, the rotating updraft, 3) The increased entrainment and dilution into a cloud updraft in its thermal stage, and the decreased entrainment and dilution of the jet stage results in non-negligible (>10%) decreases and increases (respectively) in precipitation production within the storm."

This project is unique in that it uses as statistics based approach to analyze characteristics of solar active regions. Being able to measure the stored and available energy, and to predict the size of an upcoming event will improve forecasting capability for solar flares and related phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and energetic particle production and propagation. These are the phenomena with direct impacts on human-dependent infrastructure and national security, hence improvements in forecasting eventually benefits large sectors of society. This project supports a postdoctoral researcher and a member of an underrepresented group who will serve as a mentor and Co-PI. Summer inters from the REU program will also be involved.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the different pathways to the release of stored coronal magnetic energy. When a large amount of free energy is stored, some active regions release it in a few large events, while others release the same amount of energy in many smaller events. Why this occurs is unknown. Two complementary approaches will be used to investigate this: 1) using photospheric proxies for the energy for a large sample of events, and 2) modeling of the coronal magnetic field for a small sample of events. In each case, the energy will be computed for subareas within each active region to estimate the fraction of the total free energy that can be released in a flare. This will be compared to the GOES soft X-ray flux of the events. Verification statistics computed from discriminant analysis will be used to determine whether photospheric proxies for sub-areas of an active region are better then global proxies at distinguishing regions which produce large events versus those which produce only small events. If the analysis indicates that the free energy computed for sub-areas are more closely associated with the energy released, this will indicate that the local configuration of the field is more important than the global configuration. The corona will be modeled using the Minimum Current Corona model and nonlinear force-free field extrapolations. For both models, a detailed comparison will be made of the possible energy release pathways to the flares that occurred, and the location of the flare emission to the currents associated with the stored energy.

Past research has shown that significantly more information about the storms, their particle types, and stage of evolution can be gleamed from using two orthogonal polarizations in radars.   This research focuses on the dual-polarization radar observations during the RELAMPAGO experiment in west Central Argentina. This region has among the most intense convective systems in the world in terms of frequency of large hail, very high storm tops, and extreme lightning activity, yet much remains unknown about the intense convection in this region. Because of the repeatability of storms in the region, this experiment will observe these storms to address science questions related to the initiation, initial organization/severe-weather generation, and growth stages of storm development, which are poorly understood.  This research will improve the understanding of, and the ability to predict, severe convective storms worldwide. Similar environments exist in many parts of the world including the US Rocky Mountains and Asia (such as Chengdu basin in China and Himalayan plains on the Indian subcontinent). The radar techniques developed from this project has the potential to benefit all the nationwide deployment of dual-polarization radars in the US.<br/><br/>This project will specifically address the analysis and retrieval of dual-polarization radar observations in some of the most intense convective storms, developing advanced retrieval techniques. The RELAMPAGO field observation set up will elucidate the tight connections between the, complex terrain, and the production of severe weather, role of terrain in initiating and developing organized convective storms and resultant intensity.  Development and application of advanced radar techniques, specially using frequency domain procedures, to identify the type of precipitation particles in the storm is an important part of this project."

Precursory eastward traveling planetary-scale waves in the mesosphere are thought to play a triggering role in initiating such abrupt breakdown of the wintertime polar vortex, but their origin and importance are not well understood. The atmospheric response to the vortex's demise can in turn excite westward traveling planetary-scale waves and amplify atmospheric tidal disturbances. However, the impacts and mechanisms of these responses in the upper mesospheric and lower thermospheric region are still unclear. This project combines analysis from space-based (Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, or MLS and Sounding of the Atmosphere using the Broadband Emission Radiometry, or SABER) and ground-based sensors (network of high-frequency radars), reanalysis, and a global chemistry-climate model to further illuminate the roles and causes of these traveling waves and tidal disturbances with respect to sudden stratospheric warming. <br/><br/>Understanding the impacts of these atmospheric perturbations may improve knowledge of space physics and the assessments of stratospheric ozone loss and wintertime climate evolution. Specifically, these perturbations can promote strong ionospheric variability that alters global communications and induce forcings that enhance the downwelling of ozone-destroying chemical species from the upper mesosphere. New insights on precursory mesospheric waves prior to the vortex breakdown can assist seasonal forecasting. Importantly, the research activities will offer experiential learning opportunities for undergraduates on cutting-edge research that is unique in South Carolina and the greater Southeastern Regions. While serving as frameworks for a doctoral thesis, project results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at a state-supported Liberal Arts institution that is embarking on its first and only doctoral program in atmospheric science related degree."

Important and complex chemical and dynamical processes take place in this region, particularly in the exosphere, where the terrestrial atmosphere literally merges with interplanetary space. Understanding the processes that govern the coupling, energetics, and dynamics of the upper atmosphere requires observations of its mean state and its response to external forcing.  These observations will provide important constraints in developing a complete picture of the space-atmosphere system. Although the terrestrial exosphere is populated by a number of atomic and molecular species, neutral atomic hydrogen is increasingly dominant with altitude and present throughout. The vertical distribution of atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere and its vertical transport flux are recognized as important parameters in understanding upper atmospheric chemistry, charge exchange between the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere, and coupling between atmospheric regions. Unfortunately, few direct determinations of these parameters have been achieved. This leaves important questions incompletely answered: What is the distribution of atomic hydrogen in the thermosphere and exosphere? How does that distribution respond to external forcing? Is the upward flux of hydrogen from the mesosphere constant or variable? What are the exospheric particle populations and velocity distributions (satellite, ballistic and escaping components)? <br/><br/>This study is called INSpIRe, for ""Investigate the Near Space Interaction Region.""  It is a five year career development plan to: (1) integrate two state-of-the-art second generation Fabry-Perot annular summing spectrometers into a remotely operable facility; (2) deploy this instrumentation to a clear-air site, establishing a stable, well-calibrated observing platform; (3) embark on a series of observations specifically designed to contribute to three major areas of geocoronal research, i.e., geocoronal physics, structure/coupling, and variability; (4) establish an adaptable facility capable of contributing to many areas of terrestrial aeronomy.<br/><br/>From integration to implementation, initiative INSpIRe will provide a platform to encourage and educate the next generation of researchers and a venue to apply knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world science and engineering challenges. Initiative INSpIRe will open new avenues for undergraduate participation in research through active learning, encourage undergraduate students to pursue independent research early in their careers, enhance the growing Ph.D. program in Engineering Physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), and involve the public in the wonder of discovery through open house events, tours, and demonstrations. <br/><br/>When fully operational, initiative INSpIRe will also be capable of contributing to many areas of optical aeronomy beyond the core scientific focus of this study. The unique capabilities of the Fabry-Perot instruments assembled as part of initiative INSpIRe afford opportunities to extend aeronomical research into the related field of planetary aeronomy, opening new avenues for research and community involvement."

Many aspects of tropical climate, including the distribution of rainfall and surface winds, are closely related to the east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the equatorial Pacific, between the warm pool of the western Pacific and the cold tongue extending from the eastern boundary.  Previous work by the PIs shows a strong relationship between the SST gradient in the equatorial Pacific and the contrast in brightness, or albedo, between tropical and extratropical clouds.  The PIs have developed a theory to explain this connection, in which extratropical clouds with higher albedo imply less sunlight absorbed by the ocean at higher latitudes, which in turn requires greater heat transport from the tropics, which is satisfied by greater oceanic heat uptake in the cold tongue and subsequent oceanic transport, which requires colder temperatures in the cold tongue and thus a greater temperature contrast between the cold tongue and the warm pool.<br/><br/>Motivated by this theoretical framework,  the PIs test the hypothesis that latitudinal variations in the response of cloud albedo to greenhouse warming play a key role in driving changes in tropical climate associated with the east-west SST contrast across the Pacific.  The PIs perform greenhouse warming simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in n fully coupled, slab ocean, and prescribed SST configurations, in which cloud feedbacks and their effects on the equatorial Pacific SST contrast are assessed.  Complimentary analysis of greenhouse warming simulations from the archive of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) is also performed.  As ocean heat transport plays an important role, a water parcel tracking scheme is applied to identify the location and time of last ventilation for water in the equatorial mixed layer, which can then be related to cloud radiative effects felt by the parcel during ventilation.<br/><br/>The research has broader societal impacts as it addresses fundamental issues in tropical climate which are essential for anticipating future climate changes in a populous region.  The work has broader scientific impacts because the results will likely be helpful for understanding warm climates of the past, in particular the Pliocene, a period 3-5 million years ago when carbon dioxide levels were as high as today and the equatorial Pacific SST gradient is believed to have been weaker.  The work has additional educational broader impacts through the participation of one of the PIs in National Center for Science Education ""Scientists in the Classroom"" pilot project, in which she will work with a middle school teachers and students.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Understanding how human and earth system trajectories will interact is essential to making better decisions that can reduce negative consequences for society and ecosystems. Research related to climate impacts has traditionally been separated into a number of poorly coordinated tasks, with independent models and research groups developing a) socio-economic development pathways, b) emissions and land use scenarios, c) land cover projections, d) climate simulations, and e) impact assessments. This disjointed approach has led to inconsistencies in assumptions across different components of the problem, lack of incorporation of feedbacks, unmanaged uncertainty propagation, and introduction of errors when upscaling or downscaling information across components.<br/><br/>To address these issues, better approaches to impact assessment are required that provide richer, higher resolution, and more internally consistent information about future societal and earth system conditions, and that link models of human and earth systems more effectively. The central objective of this proposal is to improve understanding of the joint consequences of socio-economic development and regional climate change by developing and applying tools to better integrate human and earth system models. This objective will be pursued by focusing on impacts in three key systems - urban areas, agriculture, and forests - in three regional case studies in rapidly developing countries - China, India, and Brazil. The project will develop an integrated suite of community tools for linking the most relevant type of global human system model, integrated assessment models (IAMs), with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed and validated through broad-based scientific collaboration and community support over the past 15 years. It will employ these tools to link the CESM with one IAM, the integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS) model, and carry out end-to-end impact assessments for our case study regions, from socio-economic scenario development through earth system analysis to impact and adaptation assessment. These assessments will serve as a proof-of-concept for this new modeling framework as well as produce valuable assessment information. Importantly, the research framework will be applicable in other human systems, in other regions, and with other IAMs than those employed here, to contribute to an even broader understanding of the human consequences of climate change."

The program of research presents the opportunity to study a new regime of thermal energy transport, in which the global structure of the plasma must be considered, and to determine how it affects the overall energy balance of the Sun's upper atmosphere.  This will be of value to other areas of space plasma physics.  By combining what is learned from the hot emission with what is already known from the warm emission, strong constraints will be placed on the properties of coronal heating.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this CAREER project target students at all levels as well as educators.  The physics' topics on which this research is based will be incorporated into the solar astrophysics graduate course taught by the PI, from which a graduate student will be recruited specifically to work on this project.  The program also provides opportunities for undergraduate participation in research.  A major part of this project is a summer school program on key physical science concepts, taught within the context of the Sun, for rising juniors and seniors in the Houston Independent School District, which educates predominantly minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students.  The mode of teaching will be through peer instruction and mentoring in small groups.  A high school teacher will assist the PI, and will develop lesson plans and other curriculum material based on the outcomes of the summer program for dissemination to other teachers, publication in educational journals, presentation at major conferences, and contribution to the Connexions website.

For reasons of computational expense GCMs have traditionally used grid spacings of a hundred kilometers or more, at which it is  not possible to represent individual clouds or even large cloud systems.  Cumulus clouds, which produce intense precipitation and have other important effects, are represented indirectly in these models by convective parameterizations, which attempt to capture their aggregate behavior over a grid cell. With increasing computer power it has become possible to run GCMs at resolutions high enough to enter the ""gray zone"", in which some portion of the motions of the largest cumulus ensembles is explicitly represented on the model grid, but the smaller clouds must still be represented indirectly through convective parameterization.  The goal of the work performed here is to develop a parameterization which adjusts automatically and seamlessly as grid spacing decreases and a greater portion of the cumulus activity is resolved explicitly.  At coarser resolutions the parameterization represents the entire spectrum of cloud sizes and motions, but at fine resolutions the parameterization effectively shuts itself off and allows the clouds to be explicitly simulated.  The scheme is called the ""unified parameterization"" because it unifies the treatment of clouds between fine resolution cloud resolving models (CRMs) and coarse-scale GCMs.<br/><br/>The unified parameterization is implemented in two models, one a CRM with a limited regional domain which is capable of explicit cloud simulation.  Reference simulations with a resolution of 1-2km are performed, and these are compared to simulations at progressively coarser resolutions using the unified parameterization.  The simulations assess the extent to which the unified scheme mimics the behavior of the fine-resolution simulation and approximates it more faithfully as resolution increases.  These simulations are meant to test and develop the unified parameterization at the fine-scale end of the gray zone.  The other is a GCM, the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), and experiments with this model explore the behavior of the parameterization on the coarse-scale side of the zone.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potential of the unified parameterization to improve models used for weather forecasting and for anticipating the likely consequences of climate change.  Deficiencies in cumulus parameterization are a persistent source of bias in weather and climate models, and diminish their value for research and operational applications. Moreover, the issue of mixed implicit-explicit cloud representation addressed in the work will become increasingly important as higher resolutions are adopted for weather and climate models.  The use of CAM, a freely available model developed by and for the research community, as a testbed for the scheme enables community access to results of the research.  In addition, the project will support and train a graduate student, thereby supporting the next generation of researchers in model development.  The project is a continuation of research begun with the support of the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes (CMMAP), an NSF Science and Technology Center."

The project will develop an integrated suite of community tools for linking the most relevant type of global human system model, integrated assessment models (IAMs), with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed and validated through broad-based scientific collaboration and community support over the past 15 years. It will employ these tools to link the CESM with one IAM, the integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS) model, and carry out end-to-end impact assessments for our case study regions, from socio-economic scenario development through earth system analysis to impact and adaptation assessment. These assessments will serve as a proof-of-concept for this new modeling framework as well as produce valuable assessment information. Importantly, the research framework will be applicable in other human systems, in other regions, and with other IAMs than those employed here, to contribute to an even broader understanding of the human consequences of climate change."

The larges of these disturbances is the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a broad envelope of clouds and precipitation that forms in the Indian Ocean and moves slowly eastward as far as the central equatorial Pacific. The MJO affects weather and climate over much of the globe, with US impacts including hurricane formation in the Gulf of Mexico and flooding in California due to atmospheric rivers.  The slow evolution and widespread impacts of the MJO have spurred interest in MJO prediction, and the MC presents a challenge to forecasting as models have difficulty predicting which events will transit the region and which will dissipate within it. The desirability of long-range forecasts of MJO impacts has thus lead to an interest in understanding the mechanisms through which the MC interacts with the MJO and serves as a gatekeeper for their entry into the equatorial Pacific.<br/><br/>This project is one component of the Equatorial Line Observations (ELO) field campaign, which seeks to understand the local MC processes that influence MJO propagation.  The campaign is a joint project between researchers in the US, Great Britain, and Indonesia in which oceanic observations are taken along the equator using sea gliders off the west coast of Sumatra and moorings in the Karimata Strait between Sumatra and Borneo.  The oceanic observations are complemented by land-based observations in eastern Sumatra and on the west coast of Borneo, with deployment scheduled between November 2018 and February 2019.  ELO is part of a larger international effort known as the Years of the Maritime Continent, organized under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization.<br/><br/>The campaign targets three factors which are hypothesized to influence MJO propagation through the MC.  The first is interactions between atmospheric disturbances and the underlying ocean.  Abundant rainfall over the internal seas of the MC produces a shallow surface layer of fresh water which can be warmed and cooled rapidly by variations in sunlight reaching the surface, wind-driven evaporation, and other factors.  Variations in sea surface temperature can in turn influence cloudiness and precipitation, and the campaign seeks to understand how this air-sea coupling affects eastward propagating atmospheric disturbance.<br/><br/>The second is the interaction of the MJO with convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs), which are smaller equatorial weather disturbances which propagate eastward at a faster rate than the MJO and are regarded as its ""building blocks"".  The PIs hypothesize that the problems with the representation of MJO propagation through the MC seen in forecast models are related to poor simulation of CCKW activity in the region.<br/><br/>The third is the interaction of CCKWs with the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the MC, as intense precipitation generally occurs after noon over Sumatra and Borneo but in the morning over the Karimata Strait separating them.  The distance between the islands is such that a CCKW passing over Sumatra during the rainy part of the day is likely to arrive at Borneo in time for the precipitation maximum on the following day.  The PI hypothesizes that the extra condensational heating received by CCKWs which are synchronized with the island diurnal cycles could favor their growth and further interaction with the MJO.<br/><br/>The work has societal as well as scientific value given the worldwide impacts of the MJO and the potential for improvement of MJO-related forecasts. The work also promotes international capacity building in atmospheric science and operational forecasting, as it is conducted in collaboration with Indonesian partners. The campaign involves PhD students from the US, Great Britain, and Indonesia, thus providing future workforce development in this research area."

Therefore, spatial and temporal scaling of surface fluxes is fundamental to how we evaluate theories on what happens within the sub-grid of atmospheric models and how those feed back onto larger scale dynamics. The Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors (CHEESEHEAD) is an intensive field-campaign designed specifically to address long-standing puzzles regarding the role of atmospheric boundary-layer responses to scales of spatial heterogeneity in surface-atmosphere heat and water exchanges.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The high-density observing network is coupled to large eddy simulation (LES) and machine-learning scaling-experiments to better understand sub-mesoscale responses and improve numerical weather and climate prediction formulations of sub-grid processes. This project will advance spatiotemporal scaling methods for heterogeneous land surface properties and fluxes and theories on the scales at which the lower atmosphere responds to surface heterogeneity. CHEESEHEAD aims to provide a level of observation density and instrumentation reliability never previously achieved to test and develop hypotheses on spatial heterogeneity and atmosphere feedbacks.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The experiment generates knowledge that advances the science of surface flux measurement and modeling, relevant to many scientific applications such as numerical weather prediction, climate change, energy resources, and computational fluid dynamics.

A graduate student and two early-career scientists will be trained through this project.<br/><br/>El Nino/La Nina events that occur every few years are characterized by massive warming/cooling over the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean together with weakening/strengthening of trade winds. This strong inter-annual fluctuation of the global climate system is referred to as the ENSO phenomenon. It accompanies by systematic changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulations, affecting global weather and climate systems, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and fisheries, and thereby having a great impact on economics of well-being and people's life.  The ENSO phenomenon exhibits rich diversity in its strength, duration and patterns of warming/cooling and in its global impacts.  Fundamental issues concerning ENSO remain to be better addressed.  For example, whether there exist roughly two groups of ENSO typical patterns, namely the so-called Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific El Nino is an active research topic in the scientific community.  Furthermore, how influences of ENSO in the tropic Pacific are spread into the highly complex global climate system and ecosystem, remains a question to be better understood.  <br/><br/>The PI will conduct systematic theoretical, diagnostic, and numerical modeling investigations to achieve the following three objectives: (1) further advancing linear and nonlinear theories for the origins of the ENSO pattern diversity; (2) better understanding of the mechanisms causing ENSO complex temporal evolution and their impacts (3) further investigating the sensitivity of ENSO patterns and temporal characteristics to biases and future changes in tropical climate mean state and in parameters of key physical processes of the climate models.

This research addresses the F1 layer of the ionosphere that spans 130-230 km. This region is populated by molecular ions at the lower levels and atomic ions at the upper boundary. This mixture of constituents has led to the F1 region being less studied than other parts of the ionosphere where the composition is simpler. However, F1 electric fields and ion drifts are highly variable in space and time, so understanding this region is clearly important for electromagnetic wave propagation, space weather prediction, and their ramifications for communications and positioning industries. <br/><br/>Incoherent scatter radars (ISR) are the primary instruments to study the F1 layer. Radar signals (""echoes"") can yield information about wind and temperature, but the process suffers from a lack of uniqueness, as different combinations of ion mass and electron/ion temperatures can present with the same echo power. The Principal Investigator (PI) will combine ion and plasma emissions observed by the ISR at Arecibo to infer temperature, composition and velocity without the traditional assumptions that have constrained previous efforts. He will examine altitude, seasonal and solar activity dependences, and the balance between photochemical and dynamical processes that maintain F1.

Preliminary estimation suggests that nitrogen emissions from fires in peatlands can potentially rival that of fossil fuel combustion.  An accurate assessment of the global nitrogen cycling requires a detailed understanding of the various nitrogen-containing compounds emitted during peat fires and the factors affecting their partitioning into the gas and particle phases and the changes that they undergo in the atmosphere with age.<br/><br/>The main hypothesis of the proposed work is that an important fraction of peat fuel nitrogen (N) is contained in particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and that this fraction changes during photochemical processing in the atmosphere. The objectives of the research are: 1) to evaluate the partitioning of peat soil N into gas and particle-phase components as a function of peat fuel type and combustion efficiency, with a particular focus on quantifying the PON fraction; and 2) to assess how the oxidation (aging) of smoke by hydroxyl (OH) radicals alters the abundance and chemical properties of the PON.<br/><br/>The proposed work is expected to advance the understanding of the importance of peat fires for global N cycling and atmospheric chemistry. The research results will be distributed to US natural resource managers through a webinar, which may inform their decision-making on peatland restoration and preservation.

They are also of fundamental importance to the study of cloud physics. These processes include the riming growth of graupel and hail, collision between graupel/hail and ice crystals, and the aggregation of snowflakes. They occur in deep convective clouds and it influences the further development of such clouds due to its thermodynamic and dynamic effects. The ice crystal-graupel collision is known to be connected with the electrification of thunderclouds. Hail damage costs billions of dollars annually to agriculture and properties. Snow aggregates dominate the anvil process in storms. Quantitative knowledge of these processes is necessary for accurate weather and climate predictions, but so far this is poorly understood.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This project will perform a numerical study to investigate the fall behavior and diffusion and collisional growth of large ice particles (graupel, hail, rimed crystals and snow aggregates) for a wide variety of ice particle types, shapes and sizes. Numerical models will be developed to simulate the fall behavior of these large ice particles as they accrete other particles while changing their shapes. Collision growth models will also developed to study the collision growth rates of them due to accretion of supercooled droplets or ice particles. The former involves solving numerically the relevant Navier-Stokes equations to obtain the flow field of the falling particle that may perform complex motions such as translation, vibration, rotation, etc. The equation of motion of the supercooled droplets or ice particles around the falling ice particle will be solved so as to determine the trajectory and hence the collision efficiency.  The computation of the ventilation coefficient of the falling ice particle will be conducted and the convective diffusion equation of water vapor around the ice particles will be solved to determine their diffusion growth rates.<br/><br/>The results from the study will fill a major gap in this fundamental area of cloud physics and provide necessary quantitative information on how these processes operate in clouds.<br/>Such information can be used by a cloud resolving model to design better ice growth parameterizations to understand better the convective cloud dynamics.

Many aspects of tropical climate, including the distribution of rainfall and surface winds, are closely related to the east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the equatorial Pacific, between the warm pool of the western Pacific and the cold tongue extending from the eastern boundary.  Previous work by the PIs shows a strong relationship between the SST gradient in the equatorial Pacific and the contrast in brightness, or albedo, between tropical and extratropical clouds.  The PIs have developed a theory to explain this connection, in which extratropical clouds with higher albedo imply less sunlight absorbed by the ocean at higher latitudes, which in turn requires greater heat transport from the tropics, which is satisfied by greater oceanic heat uptake in the cold tongue and subsequent oceanic transport, which requires colder temperatures in the cold tongue and thus a greater temperature contrast between the cold tongue and the warm pool.<br/><br/>Motivated by this theoretical framework,  the PIs test the hypothesis that latitudinal variations in the response of cloud albedo to greenhouse warming play a key role in driving changes in tropical climate associated with the east-west SST contrast across the Pacific.  The PIs perform greenhouse warming simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in n fully coupled, slab ocean, and prescribed SST configurations, in which cloud feedbacks and their effects on the equatorial Pacific SST contrast are assessed.  Complimentary analysis of greenhouse warming simulations from the archive of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) is also performed.  As ocean heat transport plays an important role, a water parcel tracking scheme is applied to identify the location and time of last ventilation for water in the equatorial mixed layer, which can then be related to cloud radiative effects felt by the parcel during ventilation.<br/><br/>The research has broader societal impacts as it addresses fundamental issues in tropical climate which are essential for anticipating future climate changes in a populous region.  The work has broader scientific impacts because the results will likely be helpful for understanding warm climates of the past, in particular the Pliocene, a period 3-5 million years ago when carbon dioxide levels were as high as today and the equatorial Pacific SST gradient is believed to have been weaker.  The work has additional educational broader impacts through the participation of one of the PIs in National Center for Science Education ""Scientists in the Classroom"" pilot project, in which she will work with a middle school teachers and students.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Much of the research focuses on the interaction of cloud radiative effects and atmospheric circulation.  One issue to be addressed is the close association over the western equatorial Pacific between atmospheric heating due to the radiative effects of clouds and associated water vapor and energy export from the region.  The PI hypothesizes that the radiative heating of the atmosphere by clouds and vapor anomalies plays a deciding role in horizontal energy export, in part because cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere increases the requirement for export.  The research further considers the possible effect of upper-tropospheric cloud radiative heating in confining the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) to a narrow strip near the equator.  A role for cloud radiative effects in confining the ITCZ would be of interest given the persistent double-ITCZ bias in climate models, in which models incorrectly produce an ITCZ on either side of the equator.  Further research considers the role of cloud radiative effects in determining key features of the atmospheric circulation response to global warming, including the expansion of the Hadley cell (accompanied by an expansion of the dry regions in the subtropics) and the poleward shift of the midlatitude jet streams commonly found in model simulations.  A related issue to be addressed is the dipole in shortwave cloud radiative feedback over the Southern Ocean, where the feedback is negative in lower latitudes (where it thus serves to counteract greenhouse warming) but positive in higher latitudes.  Previous work by the PI and his collaborators suggests that the positive feedback at higher latitudes is due to cloud brightening as  warmer temperatures favor liquid droplets over ice particles in clouds.  Two other topics to be addressed are the mechanisms which produce El Nino-like conditions in the equatorial Pacific sector, and the contribution of natural variability to the increasing sea ice cover trend around Antarctica and the decline of sea ice in the Arctic.  The work is conducted through analysis of observations and a variety of numerical model simulations, for example the experiments conducted in the Clouds On Off Climate Intercomparison Experiment are examined to understand the role of cloud radiative effects in energy export and ITCZ confinement.  <br/><br/>The project has societal broader impacts due to the value of improved understanding of the climate system for anticipating and responding to the likely consequences of climate variability and change.  In addition, the project supports three graduate students, thus promoting the development of the next generation of climate science researchers.  The PI also engages in outreach to the public and stakeholders through a variety of venues."

The African easterly jet often gives birth to weather systems known as African easterly waves. Together the jet and the waves form a complex system whose influence on weather can extend to the United States. That influence often manifests as tropical cyclones, whose genesis has been linked to the easterly waves. Consequently, to understand the connection between the weather over North Africa and the development of tropical cyclones, it is important to understand the processes that affect the African easterly jet&#8210;African easterly wave system. Of those processes, the heating effects of Saharan dust storms are among the least understood, yet potentially among the most important.

The results of this research are expected to have implications that go beyond the atmospheric sciences, to numerous industrial and other natural processes.<br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to: (1) advance measurement methods to make it possible to measure the size distribution of freshly nucleated clusters/particles as a function of time as they exist in the atmosphere in which they are formed in order to map their passage through the Kelvin regime, i.e., from near critical, or even sub-critical cluster sizes through to stable particles; (2) measure and model the multicomponent activation kinetics as low volatility organic compounds and extremely low volatility organic compounds condense on inert and sulfuric acid clusters in the Kelvin size regime, varying the temperature and composition of the atmosphere to probe the underlying mechanisms; (3) measure and model new particle formation, secondary activation, and growth in carefully controlled chamber experiments in order to constrain and parameterize new particle formation under a wide range of atmospheric conditions and for key aerosol precursors."

EMIC waves are created by the interaction of plasma with the Earth's magnetic field.  These waves play an important role in both the energization and loss of particles in the Van Allen radiation belts.  Since the radiation belts overlap the region where satellites operate understanding the factors that can change their intensity is an important aspect of predicting space weather impacts.  This project will use a combination of observations and numerical modeling to address EMIC wave dynamics.  Most previous modeling in this area has used ray-tracing methods.  This project takes the novel approach of using a full wave model to simulate the wave dynamics.   The project will support the efforts of young female scientist who is serving as the PI.  It will also provide support to PhD graduate student.  The investigators will also plan to provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the research through partnership with National Undergraduate Fellowship Program in Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy Sciences program.<br/> <br/>More specifically this project addresses the following questions; (a) How do equatorially generated EMIC waves reach the ground?; (b) How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?; and (c) What are the relative contributions of magnetospheric/ionospheric parameters and wave normal angle to EMIC wave propagation from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere? To achieve this goal, the investigators plan to  perform full-wave simulations employing recently developed 2D full-wave code with realistic plasma parameters. We will also analyze recent observations of these waves by Van Allen Probes, THEMIS and GOES satellites and compare them with observations from the ground magnetometer network."

Thus, accurate knowledge about the solar and thermal infrared radiation in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system is critical to robust climate study.  An example of this sensitivity is the suggestion that a 1% decrease in the solar constant could lead to an ice age. The effect of doubling CO2 on radiative forcing is approximately 4 Wm-2, whereas uncertainties in radiation simulations due to, for example, insufficient knowledge about the optical properties of clouds, may be larger than this value. During the 1980s and 1990s, many researchers made substantial progress in developing and improving radiative transfer schemes used in general climate models (GCMs), and various intercomparisons of GCM radiation codes were published. Since that time, significant progress has been made in light scattering computational methods, in-situ measurements and laboratory studies of the optical and microphysical properties of clouds and aerosols, gaseous absorption line parameters and the water vapor continuum absorption, optical properties of various oceanic constituents, and the efficiency of numerical schemes for solving radiative transfer equations. There is a pressing need to incorporate the aforesaid progress into radiative transfer modeling capabilities. Moreover, the ocean and atmosphere are not coupled in many existing radiative transfer models. The scattering and absorption of radiation by oceanic water, dissolved organic matter (the so-called yellow substance), and phytoplankton have an influence in heating the uppermost water layers, and consequently affect thermal and dynamic properties such as the sea surface temperature and depth of the mixed atmosphere-ocean layer.  The reflection of radiation by the oceans, including the effects of a wavy air-water interface and whitecap, can also affect the spectral characteristics and magnitude of radiation and, thus, the radiative heating and cooling rates in the atmosphere. The overarching goal is to systematically evaluate and further improve current radiative transfer modeling capabilities. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The outcomes of the study will include 1) systematic quantification of the potential errors/inaccuracies of the aforesaid radiative transfer models, 2) extension of the current radiative transfer modeling capabilities to an atmosphere-ocean coupled system, 3) implementation of spectrally consistent parameterizations of ice clouds and dust aerosols, and 4) development and implementation of a computationally efficient radiative transfer solver.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The research effort will improve the radiative transfer package currently used in climate models, and be a valuable contribution to the atmospheric radiative transfer and climate study communities.  Furthermore, the light scattering modeling and parameterization capabilities can find potential applications in other areas such as remote sensing of dust aerosol and ice cloud properties. The associated educational pursuits will focus on mentoring a postdoc researcher, training a graduate student, and developing teaching materials. This effort will contribute to training young researchers in the discipline of radiative transfer and light scattering that is a quite unique branch of atmospheric physics. Furthermore, the integration of RRTMG into classroom teaching will directly benefit the educational program in atmospheric sciences, particularly, in hands-on experience in atmospheric radiative transfer simulation."

Surprisingly, many basic questions regarding the effects of these vast quantities of dust on climate remain poorly known. How much dust is actually in the atmosphere? Does desert dust warm or cool our planet? Will future climate-induced changes in dust storms oppose or enhance man-made climate changes? This project will address these fundamental questions by leveraging satellite observations, experimental measurements of atmospheric dust and its properties, and climate model simulations of desert dust climate impacts. In addition, this project will integrate educational and research activities at UCLA's department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences through the establishment of a Research-Enhanced Learning Assistant program.<br/><br/>The research will lead to improved understanding of desert dust's prevalence and its climate impacts as well as enhance forecasts of regional and global climate changes, thereby helping to inform policies to adapt to or mitigate future climate changes. Furthermore, the project results will facilitate improved understanding of dust impacts on weather, the biosphere, air quality, and human health. Finally, the Research-Enhanced Learning Assistant program will improve learning, recruitment, and retention of geosciences students, and especially of under-represented minorities."

The mission is designed to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for removing high-energy electrons from the Earth?s radiation belts through precipitation into the upper atmosphere.    Electrons at very high energy (near the speed of light) are part of the radiation environment in near-Earth space that poses a danger to satellite systems and instruments.  The amount of radiation is highly variable especially during solar and geomagnetic storms known as space weather.  It is governed by a delicate balance of acceleration and loss processes none of which are well understood at present.    ELFIN measurements will provide unique observational evidence to help understand the physics behind the loss mechanisms at play. <br/><br/>Beyond its impact on radiation belt physics, ELFIN aims to demonstrate that major breakthroughs in our understanding of the space environment can result from low-cost missions with meaningful student and young researcher participation. The project will form part of an effort to develop an inter-disciplinary program of education surrounding microsatellites. ELFIN will be used as an educational vehicle for dozens of undergraduate and graduate students from Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Earth and Space Sciences (ESS), either being employed on the project or receiving independent study credit.  Outreach to local K-12 schools will be conducted as part of on-going efforts at UCLA. The project also builds on an established collaboration with the Aerospace Corporation on-going CubeSat development program. Components will be purchased through a subcontract to Aerospace, and mentorship will be provided by named participating collaborators at Aerospace.  The project is also receiving partial support from NASA?s Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) program. <br/><br/>The ELFIN cubesat is specifically designed to provide the first pitch-angle resolved, high energy-resolution measurements of relativistic electron fluxes in the loss cone, extending to the high energies critical for understanding radiation belt dynamics.  It will carry an energetic particle detector, measuring 50-500keV ions and 0.1-5MeV electrons and a flux gate magnetometer, which will be located at the end of a 0.75m extendable boom. Both instruments are miniaturizations of instruments developed by the PI and the proposing team for several previous NASA and DOD missions. The proposed measurements of electrons within the loss cone as a function of energy and pitch-angle will be examined and compared to recent theoretical predictions to determine whether the precipitation bears the characteristic signatures of resonant scattering by electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves or is due to other processes.  In this way, the project aims to provide a crucial test of equatorial pitch angle scattering by (EMIC) waves as a leading candidate for radiation belt electron losses."

As such, the project will help foster regional international scientific collaborations and support two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar.  <br/><br/>Although the Guliya ice cap (GIC) was surveyed and successfully drilled to bedrock at an off-summit site in 1992, logistical and time limitations prevented summit drilling, and few dating techniques were available at that time to help establish a robust timescale beyond 100,000 years Before Present (BP).  <br/><br/>Recently enhanced logistics and technologies will help the international research team significantly address these former impediments.

Profs. Johannes Hachmann, John McLean, and Theresa Windus of SUNY Buffalo, Vanderbilt and Iowa State University respectively, have assembled a team to address the potential of big data research and modern data science in the field of chemistry. The workshop brings together a diverse group of approximately 45 leaders in the chemical sciences who have expertise in the development of this field. <br/><br/>The goals of the workshop are to spearhead a broad discussion about data-driven research, and the tools to enable it. The long-term objectives of the workshop are to shape this emerging field, and to help pioneer a fundamental transformation of the discovery process in chemistry. These goals are well aligned with ideas and needs expressed in the Dear Colleague Letter on Data-Driven Discovery Science in Chemistry (D3SC), NSF 17-036, which is reflective of the ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" need, recognized as one of the ""10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investment"". The application of big data and modern data science creates new tools that promise to transform the discovery and design process in chemistry and thus boost our capacity for innovation. In addition to the far-reaching technological implications, this development also promises a significant increase in the return on public and private investments, both in terms of resources and time."

Conventional approaches require that scientists sift through data from many sources to try to develop a comprehensive picture of the field when making a new chemical compound or studying a chemical processes.  This conventional approach is slow and difficult as researchers can miss important trends.  With the support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Cyberinfrastructure for Emerging Science and Engineering Research (CESER) Program in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, Professor Xian at Washington State University (WSU) and Professor Ji are teaching machines to collect massive data from literature, analyze them, and come up with new design principles to make new sensors.  The project is in response to the Data-Driven Discovery Science in Chemistry Dear Colleague Letter (D3SC-DCL).  The team is using data mining and computer learning to develop a new generation of sensors for the detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S).  Hydrogen sulfide is an important signaling molecule that is associated with biological processes such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases.  The coupling of computer science techniques with chemical problems enables Professors Xian and Ji and their students to predict the most promising sensor design without making and testing a large number of sensors empirically. The research group ""trains their computer"" by testing the predicted sensors designs and providing feedback for the next iteration; this is machine learning.  If successful, the machine learning methods may be expanded to sensor development for the detection of many different compounds, especially those that are important in biological and chemical processes (such as biological warfare and pharmaceutical development). The research provides unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students by providing rich experiences in both chemistry and data science.  These activities build the workforce of non-traditional chemistry trainees to meet data-driven research and development needs in industry and academia. Professor Xian also actively works with undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups by participating the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PNW-LSAMP) Program at WSU.<br/><br/>Professors Xian and Ji are building a database of H2S sensors with searchable parameters.  They are carrying out data-driven optimization of the sensors based on advanced machine learning and data mining techniques. A combined data-driven discovery framework of unsupervised learning and supervised multi-task learning is developed to predict the important properties of the sensors. This approach is used to identify the most suitable fluorophores and H2S-reaction sites for the design of optimal sensors, which can then be synthesized and validated. These studies may advance our understanding of machine learning and data mining as well as chemical predication and sensor development. This interdisciplinary project provides a unique platform to attract students to chemistry and train them at the interface of chemistry, data science, and computation science. Broadening participation efforts include students from underrepresented minority groups through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PNW-LSAMP) Program at WSU."

Innovation Labs are an evolution of ""sandpit"" workshops that have been used by research funding agencies for brainstorming and team formation, to accelerate scientific innovation. Over five days of in-person interaction, participants will learn to speak each others' languages through case study presentations and bootcamp activities, frame new research questions, form interdisciplinary teams around these ideas, and initiate collaborative projects that include scientists from both the chemistry and data science communities. The projects will utilize machine learning and data-driven statistical techniques to tackle challenging chemical problems and the analysis of complex chemical data sets. A primary objective of the Innovation Lab is to forge new connections between chemists and data scientists, and stimulate new research problems and new interdisciplinary collaborations. The Innovation Lab will include graduate students as well as participants at different career stages, to strengthen future workforce development and promote the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in the research community. <br/><br/>Dramatic advances in science can result when standard modes of research are replaced with completely new ways of thinking. The potential for such advances has been recognized at the interface of data science and chemistry, a key area where chemical sciences can greatly benefit from emerging strategies in statistics, computer science, and mathematics. This project brings together experts from historically unconnected disciplines to accelerate the development of the nascent field of chemical data science.  The outcome of the Innovation Lab is anticipated to be a deeper engagement of the data and computer science communities with chemistry, sparking new collaborations between the two communities, the initiation of new ways of thinking, and joint projects that extend well beyond the time frame of the Lab itself. These projects have the potential to achieve profound scientific impact in chemistry, inspire new methodological and algorithmic development, and serve as prime examples of the interplay between data-driven and chemical approaches. Fundamental mathematical and statistical principles will be applied to tackle important chemistry problems. Conversely, the challenging data sets and problems from chemistry may inspire unanticipated methodological developments in data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most molecules are flexible, and at room temperature can exist in multiple interconverting geometries called conformers.  As molecules increase in size, complexity, and flexibility, the number of possible stable conformers increases exponentially. To accurately predict molecular properties, it is important to take into account all geometries---even those lower-probability conformers---if they have some probability of spontaneously forming at a given temperature.  Thus, a challenge is to efficiently identify these conformers despite an extremely complex, multi-dimensional geometric search spaces.  Professors Hutchison and Koes implement a unique grid-based neural network approach to predict conformers, trained on databases of high-quality calculations generated using NSF XSEDE supercomputing resources.  The machine learning techniques are validated against experimental and computational benchmarks.  They are also applied to developing improved methods for identifying drug targets, and for optimizing the design of plastic electronic materials. The databases and software developed for this project are publicly disseminated.  New tutorial resources are developed for Avogadro and 3DMol.js software tools, and new educational components on programming, visualization, and statistical machine learning areincorporated into the ""Mathematics for Chemists"" course taught by Professor Hutchison.  Both investigators give open lectures on data science and chemistry to the public and to local high school students.  They are also actively engaged in outreach to underrepresented groups through the American Chemical Society Project Seed, Pittsburgh Public Schools Science and Technology Academy, and the Drug Discovery, Systems, and Computational Biology Summer Academy for high school students.<br/><br/>The first part of this project draws upon a connection between statistical thermodynamics and Bayesian statistics. Using experimental and computational data, one can estimate distributions of dihedral angles for most molecules. From such probabilities, Bayesian optimization can be used to accurately explore and sample Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of the potential energy surface. The second aim takes advantage of recent improvements in quantum chemical methods for predicting thermochemistry for organic molecules. Using these accurate energies in tandem with experimental and other computational databases, recurrent neural-network thermochemical models are produced for molecules of different sizes and containing a wide range of elements. The resulting large data repositories and open source software tools are disseminated to the community, and used as the foundation for educational materials in a new curriculum for chemistry.  They are providing the basis for ongoing outreach and broadening participation activities to high school and undergraduate students, involving a state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary mix of data science, machine learning, and computational chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinases are a family of proteins responsible for controlling virtually all signaling processes in multicellular organisms.  Such processes are fundamental to life itself, and play a critical role in cell division, cell growth and motility, and cellular transport.  Consequently, kinases also represent potential targets for novel cancer drugs.  There are several hundred kinase proteins, organized into complex signaling pathways. Each pathway acts like a set of cascading dominos: once an initial chemical trigger occurs at a key location on the kinase molecule, it sets in motion a series of downstream reactions translating into specialized molecular functions.  Since individual kinases can participate in multiple cellular processes, these signaling pathways are often highly intertwined.  To determine the function of a particular kinase, scientists utilize small molecules as chemical probes that bind to the kinase, suppress its activity, and enable the analysis of downstream impact on cellular function. However, a significant challenge is that most existing chemical probes are not as selective as originally thought: many probes act on multiple kinases at once.  Experimental ""wet lab"" testing of all possible combinations of hundreds of kinases against tens of thousands of potential chemical probes is not practical due to cost.  Professor Karanicolas and his students are utilizing state-of-the-art advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, publicly-available data on select kinase-probe interactions, and specialized techniques developed in his laboratory for modeling the 3D structure of protein-small molecule binding, to develop a computational model that accurately predicts kinase binding affinities and chemical probe selectivity.  The project's discoveries have the potential for significant impact in facilitating fundamental studies of cell biology, as well as the identification of selective kinase inhibitors for pharmaceutical design.  The new methods are being implemented in software distributed through public repositories and the widely-used Rosetta software suite. The research is providing cross-disciplinary training opportunities fusing chemical biology and data science to students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. <br/><br/>Modern cell biology leans heavily on kinase inhibitors as chemical probes for analyzing the consequences of deactivating a particular kinase, but the majority of commonly-used chemical probes are not sufficiently target-selective for robust interpretation of observed phenotypes.  By assembling large panels of kinases (corresponding to much of the human kinome), it is possible to experimentally determine selectivity for a given probe: however, these experiments are expensive and impractical to perform at scale.  This project is applying deep learning techniques to predict the binding affinities of individual inhibitor/kinase pairs, using 3D structural descriptors derived from a novel method for modeling inhibitor/kinase complexes, recently developed in the Karanicolas group.  Following careful training and benchmarking, the predictive model is being used in two ways: 1) to evaluate the selectivity of chemical probes that are widely used by cell biologists, and determine which compounds constitute useful tools and which compounds should be deprecated; and 2) to screen a large chemical library of small molecules to identify new candidate probes that are expected to have strong binding affinity and selectivity for a given kinase. The model's predictions in both applications are being tested experimentally through biochemical assays. While it has long been hypothesized that inclusion of 3D structural features would improve existing machine learning approaches for predicting protein/ligand binding affinities, the availability of a rapid and accurate method for building 3D structural models will allow this hypothesis to be tested for the first time. If successful, insights from this project will provide a starting point for developing models to predict binding affinities of other protein-ligand complexes as well, for expanded applications in cell biology and drug discovery.  The results of the project are being disseminated as publicly-available source code through SourceForge, and as modules within the widely-used Rosetta software suite.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The group is also developing teaching modules to enable exposure of a wide range of students to the concepts underlying their research.<br/><br/>Although ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry (MS) has many attributes that make it well positioned to fulfill unmet needs in structural biology and biophysics, concerns about the fidelity of solution- and gas-phase structures have inhibited the broader adoption of IM-MS technologies and reduced the confidence in structural models based on IM-MS. The Bush group is working to (1) characterize the effects of charge state on the structures of protein ions; (2) characterize the dynamics of protein ions rearrangements; and (3) increase the information content of current IM experiments and calculations using modern statistical methods. The outcomes of this research will address urgent needs in the IM-MS community by providing detailed knowledge of the structures and dynamics of native-like ions, developing more accurate methods for translating observables from IM-MS experiments into restraints for structural modeling, and developing a general method for translating structural models into accurate predictions of observables.

Calibration is a multidisciplinary problem, but in analytical chemistry, it involves forming a quantitative mathematical relationship between an instrumental signal, such as from a hand held near infrared spectrometer, and a property of interest in a sample, such as the pulp content of trees or the amount of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in tablets. A key feature of the new mathematical calibration processes is the ability to include unlabeled data, for instance, spectra of samples without reference values. With unlabeled data, calibration costs and time will be substantially reduced. Another key feature is a mathematical process allowing adaption of a calibration to new measurement conditions with minimal effort, even if unlabeled data is not available. A minimum of four undergraduates from Idaho State University and a Hispanic professor as a Research Opportunity Award from Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque will learn state-of-the-art calibration methods and become proficient at performing scientific research including dissemination. Education of undergraduates in these advanced methods prepares them for subsequent scientific professional pursuits.<br/><br/>This project focuses on new regularization processes for multivariate calibration and prediction based on the fundamentals of Tikhonov regularization. The calibration processes allow multiple penalties (tuning parameters) providing flexibility in forming accurate and precise calibrations and mechanisms to adapt a calibration to new conditions. With these regularization methods comes the ability to include unlabeled data, samples without reference values. Because the expensive component in calibration is obtaining reference values, costs in forming and maintaining calibrations can be substantially reduced with unlabeled data. In order to select optimal values for tuning parameters, new fusion ranking methods will be developed and applied. The overall objective is development of computational regularization processes to adapt a calibration to a new domain using multiple tuning parameters, multiple calibration merits, and unlabeled data if it is available. Results from this project will advance the multidisciplinary field of multivariate calibration. For example, process analytical technology for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, environmental and agriculture monitoring, and medical diagnostics all rely on multivariate calibration. With the improvements being targeted in this project, these diverse fields may well be better equipped to perform and sustain calibrations. Another broader impact of this project is the planned dissemination of the calibration algorithms via the investigators' web sites, allowing newcomers and practitioners direct access."

The PES are central to how chemists think about the structure and dynamics of molecular systems, in terms of minima and asymptotes connected by paths across landscapes or over energetic barriers.  The potential energy surfaces that Dawes and his coworkers create are used to study molecular dynamics and spectroscopy data that is relevant to many chemical processes including atmospheric chemistry, astrochemistry, and combustion.   A major thrust of the project is to develop a user-friendly, freely-distributed software package to support and enable members of a wider community, both experimentalists and theorists, to create their own potential energy surfaces to study a large variety of different systems. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop user-friendly software that acts as a bridge between codes that perform electronic structure calculations and those that compute the dynamics of interest.  The idea is to represent the electronic structure data with such high-fidelity that the computed dynamics directly reflect the underlying level of electronic structure calculations. (The fit only serves to render affordable the millions of potential evaluations required by dynamics codes). Very high fitting accuracy is required in order to assess the performance of subtly different methods or the importance of small correction terms. Previous work by Professor Dawes has resulted in suitably accurate interpolative methods known as interpolating moving least squares (IMLS). The automated fitting methods that were developed have reduced the bottleneck of PES generation and produced a stockpile of spectroscopically accurate PES. The current plan is to develop a generalized, extendable software distribution that others in the community can use to generate and fit their own PES.  The particular focus of this project is on processes involving several coupled PES. This involves systematic studies of systems which include various non-adiabatic interactions between electronic states such as conical intersections, Renner-Teller interactions, and spin-orbit coupling.  Accurate treatment of these effects in real applications represents the frontier of theoretical dynamics."

This is achieved by chemically reacting accessible sites on a protein with specific chemical labels and subsequently using MS to discover which sites on the protein were labeled.  Prof. Lindert's ""MS-Fold"" software then infers the protein structure from this labeling information.  Given the importance of proteins in regulating the chemistry of life, better tools for probing protein structure supports better understanding of that chemistry in both healthy and diseased organisms.  To help convey these principles to a general audience, the Lindert group is also developing an MS-Fold version of the popular scientific video game Foldit.  This work aims to increase public scientific literacy, and to expand interest and engagement in STEM science and technology-related disciplines. The ultimate goal is to increase STEM participation, particularly of underrepresented groups, and to improve STEM education at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/><br/>Sophisticated mass spectrometry (MS) techniques in conjunction with covalently-labeled protein residues can yield important information about protein structure. However, easy and reliable translation of this information into accurate structural models remains particularly challenging. The overall goal of research in the Lindert lab is to develop advanced computational tools that can convert MS-generated covalent labeling data into protein structural models in an automated fashion. Specifically, the research objective is to develop and validate a software tool, termed ""MS-Fold"", that will allow data generated from covalent labeling MS studies (e.g. solvent-exposed protein residues) to be effectively used to guide protein structure prediction algorithms. MS-Fold is intended to provide the analytical biochemistry community with a user-friendly computational tool with which covalent labeling MS data can be integrated into high-resolution analysis of protein structure and macromolecular interactions. This in turn will dramatically improve interpretability of MS data, constituting a significant advance in the field of structural MS and providing new opportunities for investigators to extract useful information from results of advanced MS experiments.

He and his research group are developing methods to scale exact quantum dynamical molecular simulations across the next generation of massively parallel supercomputers. Molecular simulations promise to enable computers to replace expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.  Thus, these simulations used routinely in many areas (energy, drug design, nanomaterials, etc). However, most simulations treat the atomic nuclei that make up the molecules as classical particles and ignore quantum dynamical effects of nuclear motion. Quantum effects can be important, and excluding them may lead to unreliable results. Including them, on the other hand, presents daunting numerical hurdles and difficult mathematics. To meet this challenge, Poirier and coworkers are developing the world's first massively parallel exact quantum dynamics code, SwitchIT, which is also designed to be easy to use (even for ""non-experts"") and easy to access (anyone may download the package for free). SwitchIT may thus dramatically improve the accuracy, reliability and true predictive power of molecular simulations, in the many areas where these are employed.  Poirier and coworkers plan to release the SwitchIT as open source and build a user community around the language by ensuring that interested researchers can contribute to the SwitchIT codebase. This permits a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award.<br/><br/><br/>Recent developments in supercomputing technology promise great leaps forward in scientific computation, with the potential to significantly advance a broad range of scientific fields. Increasingly, cutting edge science has come to rely on large-scale interdisciplinary collaboration, shared infrastructure, and massively parallel high performance computers (HPC). At the same time, within the chemical dynamics field, there has been a shift towards larger and more diverse systems, including nanomaterials and biological molecules. Finally, the need to incorporate quantum dynamical (QD) effects in numerical simulations in order to obtain accurate results is becoming increasingly recognized, even for large systems (e.g., electron transport in photosynthesis). The convergence of these trends is inevitable. Yet, due to steep learning curves and/or lack of access, relatively few chemists currently benefit from either HPC or exact QD. Poirier's research seeks to leverage the power of HPC, to enable exact QD calculations for larger and more challenging molecular applications than heretofore realized. Such calculations constitute a pioneering advance over previous exact QD efforts, with massive parallelization a vital CDS&E feature of the approach taken. The implementation also fuses together two linear algebra innovations that: (1) enable efficient parallelization of sparse iterative linear solvers and eigensolvers across 1000 - 10000 cores; (2) use wavelets to reduce the basis size to a manageable level, even for exact QD systems with as many as 12 atoms. ""Expert"" QD practitioners can tap into SwitchIT at a low level to introduce HPC capability into their own QD codes, whereas SwitchIT provides non-experts with an easy-to-use front end and extensive documentation.  In addition, Poirier and group members regularly provide guidance and training, as well as access to the Texas Tech Chemistry Computation Cluster. Poirier's group members themselves receive intensive interdisciplinary training in computational science and next-generation HPC highly relevant skills, e.g., for American competitiveness.  In short, this NSF award extends the complexity of systems that can be studied with exact QD, while simultaneously cyber-enabling a much broader cross section of the community to perform such calculations."

Zare at Stanford University is working on optimizing chemical reactions in microdroplets with deep reinforcement learning.  Unoptimized reactions are expensive because they waste time and reagents.  A common way for chemists to explore reaction optimization is to change one variable at a time while all other variables remain fixed. This method, however, might not find the best conditions, that is the global optimum.  Another way is to search across all combinations of reaction conditions by using batch chemistry. This approach gives a better chance to find the global optimal condition, but it is time-consuming and expensive. Deep reinforcement learning is believed to be a superior approach in which the computer analyzes a large data set and recognizes the pattern of features that lead to best reaction outcomes.  It is like training a dog: suppose we want the dog to pick up a ball.  If the dog does what we want, we say ""Good dog!""; if it does not, we say ""Bad dog!"". Similarly, Professor Zare uses a machine learning method to give the system a positive reward if the reaction reaches a better result than previous ones, or a negative reward if it does not.  A repeated process will eventually result in a set of best reaction conditions for certain reactions.  Professor Zare and his group apply this approach to microdroplet chemistry, where many reactions can be carried out in small droplets and be accelerated by factors of one thousand to one million compared with the same reaction happening in bulk solution. Combining the efficient deep reinforcement learning method with accelerated microdroplet reactions, Professor Zare and his group are seeking to find optimal reaction conditions in a fast way.  This combined approach can represent a significant step for enabling artificial intelligence to be used to optimize chemical reactions, which should have benefits in chemical production, drug screening, and materials discovery.  The students in the Zare group enjoy the unique opportunity to experience micro-droplet chemical synthesis, fast chemical characterization, and deep learning-based complex data analysis.<br/><br/>A reaction can be thought of as a system having multiple inputs (parameters) and providing one or more outputs. Example inputs include: temperature; solvent composition; pH; catalyst; droplet size; and time. Example outputs include: product yield; selectivity; purity; and cost. The goal of reaction optimization described here is to select the best inputs to achieve a given output, which can be formulated as a reinforcement learning system. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, Professor Zare is searching for critical reaction condition to try at the next step based on previous reaction conditions and product yields. A recurrent neural network is used to model the policy for reaction optimization. The reinforcement learning system is trained on mock reactions (random functions) and then real reactions for better performance.  The approach, if successful, could help better understanding of fundamental features of reactivity and enable important industrial applications."

While the periodic table provides a many possible combinations of elements from which to form materials, only a fraction of these compounds will be stable or have desirable properties for particular applications. Furthermore, of the large number of possible compounds, only about one thousand have known properties at elevated temperatures. For the past fifty years, computational chemists have used equations of quantum mechanics to discover new materials.  However, screening large numbers of candidate materials for a specific technological application remains too computationally demanding to be practical.  Recently, statistical learning approaches have been developed which can extract systematic information from large quantities of data to train highly reliable ""artificial intelligence"" models for predicting properties of a new system.  In this project, Professors Musgrave and Holder are using machine learning approaches applied to predict the stabilities, structures, and chemical reactivity of materials. The predicted properties can then be used to identify candidate materials for catalyzing technologically-important reactions, such as splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen, converting carbon dioxide into useful products, or the 'green' synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and water.  The models are available on public repositories as machine learning computer codes, and through publicly-accessible databases.  The project is training high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the development and application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for chemistry and chemical engineering applications.  The researchers participation in the Broadening Opportunity through the Leadership and Diversity (BOLD) Center at University of Colorado.  The incorporation of new concepts in machine learning and chemistry are integrated into courses and through the departmental LearnChemE YouTube platform.<br/><br/>This project combines expertise in electronic structure, thermodynamics, computational science, and machine learning to study one of the most fundamental properties of molecules--the Gibbs free energy, G(T). The data-driven approach takes advantage of results showing that the vibrational entropy and Helmholtz free energy computed in the constant-volume quasiharmonic approximation - quantities that critically contribute to G(T) but are computationally challenging to calculate quantum-mechanically - have systematic temperature dependence and can be accurately and efficiently predicted using machine learning, coupled with knowledge of the chemical composition of the material.  The researchers are extending this observation to apply machine learning methods to model G(T) directly, using experimental data for several hundred molecules for training and descriptor extraction.  The resulting descriptors are being used to predict thermochemical data for ~20,000 unique compositions tabulated in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and in turn, to compute temperature-dependent convex hull phase diagrams and solid-state reaction equilibria.  The models and G(T) data are available on large databases. The new methodology is enabling the discovery of general trends and new chemical knowledge of the effects of temperature and composition on reactivity, synthesizability, stability and metastability. In addition to providing deep insights into the thermochemistry of molecules and reactions, this research is enabling the identification of anomalies that may indicate systems where emerging properties are altering the behavior of the molecule. For example, where temperature-dependent emergent or quantum phenomena create unique materials properties. Despite the technological and economic importance of advanced materials in a broad range of technologies, much is still unknown about the detailed behavior that give rise to their stability and reactivity. Potential applications of the new techniques and thermochemical databases produced include thermochemical water splitting using redox materials, ammonia synthesis by chemical looping, oxidation chemistries, carbothermal reduction of oxides, and reduction of molecules by molecular hydrogen or other reductants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational chemistry has a long history of using the principles of quantum mechanics to create tools which provide detailed, accurate explanations for a wide variety of chemical processes. Many of these tools have reached sufficient accuracy that they can be applied to discover chemical reactions without requiring prior insight from experiment. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these methods has prevented their broad use in predicting chemical reactivity, especially in cases where the chemistry is highly complex or poorly understood. This grant supports the development of fully computational, low-cost and highly accurate methods that are able to predict the outcome of chemical reactions starting only from the feedstock molecules. The application focus of these methods is catalytic reactions, providing a highly useful tool for research into chemistries that can be applied at an industrial level to create high-value chemical products. These tools are available to the wider computational chemistry community, enabling maximized impact of the developments to a great number of problems in chemical reactivity. Due to the diversity of potential applications for this research, the students involved in this project gain not only algorithm development abilities, but also fundamental insights into processes governing molecular behavior, cutting-edge computational research experience, and problem-solving abilities that are needed to address the challenges of the 21st century. The proposed methods are transformed into educational strategies that merge introductory laboratory exercises with real-world research, starting with a pilot study in honors organic chemistry. <br/><br/>The research program builds upon work by the Zimmerman group that shows chemical reactions can be described in terms of a small number of localized, anharmonic reaction coordinates. These reaction coordinates consist of interatomic distances, angles, and torsions, and are a reliable, transferable basis for describing atomic motion. By employing advanced single-ended chain-of-states optimization algorithms which search along these coordinates for plausible chemical reactions, this research methodology can efficiently and reliably predict reactive events without guidance from chemical intuition. The main objective of ongoing work is to expand this method to cover transition metal elements, enable efficient conformation searches in systems with floppy degrees of freedom, and develop machine learning algorithms to automatically process chemical data and provide great enhancements in computational efficiency. In sum, these new reaction search techniques enable predictive reaction discovery in a wide variety of large, highly complicated chemical systems where chemical knowledge alone is not yet sufficient to make accurate predictions. These methods are being applied to challenging cases in catalysis where uncharacterized side reactions are severe impediments to efficient product formation. Ongoing discovery of these undesired reaction pathways lead to the chemical insight required to improve reaction selectivity and catalyst stability.These tools allow beginning chemistry students to hypothesize and evaluate reactions in silico, resulting in a means for students to perform research at an early stage of their studies. Such pedagogical tools are distributed to educators outside of the University of Michigan to maximize their impact."

The project is an international collaboration with Philippe Sautet, Paul Fleurat-Lessard and Carine Michel of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon in France who provide complimentary expertise and who are supported by a corresponding award of the French ANR. This project develops computational models and software capable of handling the multiscale nature and the complexity inherent to the catalytic processes entailing bifunctional catalysts in solution phase. Bifunctional catalysts are important for the conversion of biomass into liquid fuels and chemicals and therefore for a sustainable future that does not rely on dwindling petroleum sources and minimizes global warming with significant societal impact. Computer simulations can play a key role in understanding how these catalysts function and in guiding development of improved catalysts and industrially viable processes. The computational methods developed are integrated into freely available open source software libraries and distributed with a widely used molecular simulation package. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the project, as well as high school students and teachers via internships and research experience programs to train the next generation of scientists. The work has relevance for multiple domains ranging from chemistry to chemical engineering to biosciences and aids the development of biorefineries with a clear impetus on economic growth and reduced CO2 emissions.<br/><br/><br/>The developments in this project encompass a new force field and linear energy relations for fast screening of catalytic reaction networks, microkinetic simulations to extract the kinetically important steps, molecular dynamics simulations with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) algorithms that allow an adaptive exchange of particles across the QM/MM boundary to determine the activation energies of the important reactions, and parameterizations of density functional tight binding theory to maximize the accessible time scales. The combination of these methods enables for the first time to explore the combinatorial explosion in pathways in the transformation of biomass using bifunctional (a metal and an acid/base) catalysts in solution. Initially the project focuses on the hydrodeoxygenation of glycerol into propanediol, for which significant experimental data is available.

The unified reaction valley approach (URVA) of Cremer and Kraka aims to serve as a quantum chemical tool to study the mechanism of catalyzed reactions at a greater level of  than is currently easily achieved.  URVA acts like a ""high-resolution-camera"" attached to the reaction complex,  being able to reveal the interplay between vibrations and the electronic structure changes of the reaction complex. It records all events when the reaction complex follows the energy valley on the reaction side up to the energy pass point and then down through the exit valley to the products. Important and less important events are differentiated by analyzing direction and curvature of the reaction path rather than features of the reaction complex itself. Basic differences between and catalyzed and non-catalyzed reactions can be determined in this way, but also the limitations of man-made catalysts are apparent.  Enzymes are the well-tuned catalysts developed in response to stringent survival pressures. Given the remarkable catalytic power seen in many enzymes, the major focus will be on the extension and application of the URVA methodology to enzyme catalysis to determine its major advantages. The mechanism of transition metal, non-transition metal or metal-free- and (artificial) enzyme-catalyzed reactions will be systematically analyzed and compared. A strategy for de novo catalyst design is to be developed, which, by including aspects of both chemo- and bio-catalysis, can serve as an incubator for enhanced interdisciplinary efforts to generate target-specific catalysts.  The data of all reactions investigated (including reaction movies) will be collected in the CATCO reaction library, which will increase to more than 500 reactions. This library will be available to the chemical community for research, teaching, and student training.<br/><br/>During the past two years, URVA has proven to be a unique tool for the mechanistic study of more than 150 homogenous catalysis reactions. In addition to following the chemical processes of bond breaking and forming, URVA uses a substantially improved algorithm for following the reaction valley far out into the van der Waals region to monitor pre- and post-chemical processes in a high level of detail. The direction and curvature of the reaction valley are analyzed in terms of internal coordinate or curvilinear coordinate components and then directly related to electronic structure changes. Other essential tools of URVA are the local vibrational mode analysis, the charge transfer and charge polarization analysis as well as the presentation of the chemical reaction in terms of reaction phases.  Method development will include the design and programming of i) URVA methodologies for an implicit or explicit inclusion of solvent effects, ii) 2-component relativistic methods for the investigation of ""relativistic"" systems, and iii) new QM/MM methodologies for the description of chemical reactions in an enzymatic environment."

The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes which permit use of small samples. The instrument is used for research and research training at this urban university and neighboring schools. Education and training in the science of NMR data interpretation is being accomplished in three overlapping ways: (1) via one-on-one interactions and workshops with the facility director; (2) in undergraduate courses and research experiences for undergraduates; and (3) through outreach activities that include demonstrations to high school and undergraduate students, for example, in the CUNY Math & Science Partnership Program.

Developing sensors that can measure levels of critical gases with greater sensitivity and selectivity is of great importance in efforts to reduce the amounts of these gases in certain situations. Sensitivity refers to being able to measure very small amounts of the gases and selectivity refers to being able to detect a particular gas when there are many other gases present. In this project funded by the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)and the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Wang, Riley, and Sunda-Meya are using electrochemical, computational, and microscopy methods to develop new sensors, based on ionic liquids, that can measure gas levels with very high sensitivity and selectivity. An ionic liquid is a room-temperature liquid that, instead of neutral molecules, contains ions (charged molecules). The sensors that are being developed to fit into very small devices and can be used in many different places and applications. In addition to the development of sensors, new methods for investigating the strengths of bonds that hold gas molecules together are being designed. The broader impacts of this work are many, as the newly developed sensors can aid in monitoring, ameliorating, and eliminating gases that are harmful to people and the environment. One of the key features of the project is the direct involvement of undergraduates, giving them opportunities to learn many aspects of research in the physical sciences, organization of data, and preparation/presentation of scientific results and conclusions.<br/><br/>This project entails both theoretical and experimental studies aimed at investigating the structures of semiconductor/ionic liquid (SC/IL) interfaces, effective selective adsorption on these interfaces, effects of adsorption on adsorbant bond strength, and understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This is a fundamental study with strong implications for any future projects involving miniaturized sensors, gas separation, or high-performance catalytic conversion utilizing ILs and/or SCs. This systematic research is being conducted using state-of-the-art electrochemical, spectroscopic, surface science, and computational chemistry methods. The main goals of this project are to achieve a greater fundamental understanding of small molecule adsorption at IL/SC interfaces and to explore new chemistry and physics on these interfaces. ILs generate a very unique solid-like interface; consequently, they can generate extremely high electric fields and induce exceptionally large charge densities at the solid/liquid interface. The electric double layer (EDL) charge density can be much higher than traditional field-effects and allows for new levels of electrostatic modulation to be accessible. The pure ionic structure of IL itself also brings an electrostatic environment, which can potentially be manipulated for facilitating certain small molecule activation. However, electrified IL/electrode interfaces, especially SC's, with adsorbed gas molecules have not been either theoretically or experimentally studied. Here the strong interaction granted by SC with the tunability of IL interfaces are exploited in order to achieve and evaluate gas adsorption that is both sensitive and selective by systematically studying adsorption behavior in the IL environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conformational changes are key to protein function, and understanding complex protein dynamics is essential to developing design strategies for new drugs and mitigating the impact of genomic defects on human health. Standard molecular dynamical simulations provide fine-grained information on protein conformational changes at the atomic level, but systematic methods for deducing overall mechanisms from this detailed information are currently lacking. In this project, new methods are being developed to rigorously extract mechanisms of protein conformational change from simulation data, by examining the flow of energy in the system over time.

Reaction coordinates and time scale separation are fundamental concepts crucial to understanding mechanisms of protein conformational dynamics. Important organizing principles that have emerged in recent years from studies of protein dynamics include collective variables, ligand-induced conformational change, and solvent slaving. This project is formalizing and unifying these concepts from the perspective of energy flows.  The central hypothesis is that, among strongly coupled coordinates, energy flows from fast coordinates into slow ones during a protein conformational change. Thus, reaction coordinates correspond to preferred channels, each exhibiting a high degree of energy flow.  There are three specific aims: 1) Understand the mechanism of how a collective variable as reaction coordinate emerges in an activated process; 2) identify the mechanistic factors that determine relative time scales of the motions of a ligand and its surrounding protein matrix; and 3) clarify the mechanistic factors that determine relative time scales of solute coordinates and collective solvent modes.  These aims are being investigated through a succession of increasingly complex biochemical problems: deca-alanine in solution, conformational changes in solvated HIV-1 protease in the presence of an inhibitor, ligand interactions with rhodopsin and myoglobin, and the effect of amino acid point mutations on myoglobin kinetics.

Brooks III from the University of Michigan to develop computational methods to explore protein-protein interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the basis for most biological processes. An atomic description of the key features of protein-protein interactions will yield tremendous benefits in both establishing a fundamental understanding of the processes that support all living systems, and gaining the ability to manipulate and control those processes.

Moreover, the findings, methods and techniques developed in this project will be distributed through tutorials and case studies to be integrated into the Multiscale Modeling Tools for Structural Biology (MMTSB) tutorials as well as into courses taught at the University of Michigan <br/><br/>The specific outcome of the project will be computational tools and methods to i) predict environment-dependent NMR observables from coarse-grained (CG) simulations; ii) undertake the development of transferable CG interaction potentials that are specially designed for reproducing observed protein-protein interfaces; iii) undertake the development of enhanced sampling methods for efficient determination of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of intermolecular interactions. The work will focus on two demanding benchmark cases: the interactions of the viral capsid glycoprotein Hemagglutinin with putative human antibody mimics, and the chaperone activity of the bacterial acid-shock chaperone HdeA. The former system is difficult due to the large system size (>600 amino acids total), while the interactions in the latter system are highly dynamic, sensitive to the system pH, and involve multiple copies of HdeA and substrate protein."

The Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering programs in Chemistry and Physics, as well the CISE/ACI CIF21 Venture Fund for Software Reuse will contribute to the award. The exact quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and solids is computationally intractable. Accurate computational descriptions that can be carried out with current computers for systems of practically relevant sizes remains a challenge. If available, accurate descriptions promise a transformative acceleration in the cycle of materials design. The proposed work advances a new idea for the compact representation of the wave functions of atoms, molecules and materials by borrowing ideas of the field of signal processing.  The Aspuru-Guzik group is working to optimize the computer code, and then to release it both as open source and incorporated in popular quantum chemistry computer packages.  The ideas and software developed in this project will be incorporated into a massive open online course (MOOC), entitled "" The Quantum World"",  that Aspuru-Guzik is developing under the HarvardX platform. <br/><br/><br/>A technique borrowed from the field of signal processing, matching pursuit, is combined with a non-orthogonal orbital expansion. Preliminary results show that the method is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but still requires considerable software development and theoretical extension. The main objective of the current project is to advance the proposed method, namely the non-orthogonal multicomponent adaptive greedy iterative compression (NOMAGIC). NOMAGIC already has shown excellent wave function compression of the order of tens of determinants for obtaining chemically accurate solutions.   Aspuru-Guzik and coworkers are developing the NOMAGIC method as a black box method to be incorporated with several electronic structure packages. The researchers are developing methods for excited state simulation as well as to extend the ansatz considered by the approach to tensor networks."

The Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) Program in the Division of Advanced Cyber Infrastructure contributes to the award.  Computational modeling is frequently used to understand interactions between proteins, DNA, and a wide variety of small molecules at the molecular level. The use of computational methods has lead to advances in our understanding of fundamental biology and to the design of new molecules, such as anti-viral medications. However, realistic computer simulations require accurate models of the water environment that supports these interactions. Models that consider the position of every molecule of water are physically accurate but the computation time required quickly becomes prohibitive as the number of molecules grows. Other methods replace the molecular detail of water and are much faster, but at the cost of accuracy. The 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) is a third approach that avoids following the atomic positions of water by calculating the density distribution of water molecules. 3D-RISM has already been successfully used to study biological problems, such as the salt and water distribution around DNA and the binding of small molecules to proteins. This project aims to improve 3D-RISM by further developing the theory to better capture the pressure and density distribution of molecular water and apply advanced numerical methods to make these calculations faster.  Luchko and co-workers target problems that cover multiple length scales, such as the self-assembly of structures within the cell. Advances in 3D-RISM theory are distributed with the AmberTools molecular modeling suite, allowing free access to these methods for the broader research community. Undergraduates and Master's level students are involved in this research. <br/><br/>The focus of this project is to develop three independent but complementary approaches to increase the detail and accuracy of large-scale simulations to enable molecular simulations that are not currently possible. Improving the underlying theory of 3D-RISM provides the accuracy of atomistic solvent models without explicitly simulating them. This allows crystal structure refinement and solvent distributions around DNA to be determined using atomistic solvent models at a fraction of the computational cost presently required. Increasing computational efficiency one to two orders of magnitude brings the existing atomistic detail of 3D-RISM to biomolecules consisting of millions of atoms for the first time. The new end-state free energy method capitalizes on recent developments for and unique features of 3D-RISM, bringing faster, easier and more accurate free energy calculations to systems of multiple scales. Combined, these advances improve the accuracy of all solvent properties, decrease calculation time by one to two orders of magnitude and improve binding free energy predictions for large systems. These improvements are significant because they drastically increase the scope and scale of biophysical problems that atomistic molecular modeling can address."

This research seeks a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of chemical reactions by computing the sequence of atomic motions as starting materials are transformed into products. Dr. Doubleday uses a combination of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics to understand how energy flows from starting materials into products. This type of calculation allows important questions to be addressed;  for example, why one product may be favored over another. The understanding achieved in these calculations will enable better experimental control over the products of chemical reactions. An important component of this project is the training of undergraduate students in scientific research. Since research is collaborative and students learn from each other, the work fosters group skills as well as individual achievement. In collaborations with colleagues at Columbia and other institutions, Dr. Doubleday helps train students in the use of computational methods. In one project, the focus is on the active center of a class of powerful antibiotics, with the goal of understanding and control. As the principles uncovered by this research become incorporated into applied areas, potential benefits could include greater understanding and control over chemical processes important in atmospheric and life processes.<br/><br/>The computational procedure involves quasiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics, in which nuclear forces are computed at each step by an electronic structure method, usually density functional theory. In applying this method to several enediyne cyclizations, the Doubleday group has recently found a dynamic isotope effect in which isotopic selectivity occurs in the product, as a result of competition between recrossing to reactant on a vibrational timescale and isotope-dependent intramolecular vibrational redistribution.  An important part of the proposal is to carry out quasiclassical simulations of reactions in condensed phase using QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics) techniques. The proposal describes a statistically converged procedure for quasiclassical sampling of transition states in condensed phase."

Mak of the University of Southern California is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to study the molecular driving forces that determine the structures of nucleic acids. The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are central to the life cycle of the cell. The double helix is ubiquitous in the human genome, but while genetic data is safeguarded in double-stranded form, DNA also assumes diverse, transient, single-stranded structures during replication, transcription, recombination, and repair processes. In the cell, DNA and RNA are immersed in a surrounding water solvent environment, together with ambient charged species such as Mg+2. This project focuses on developing and applying an accurate and efficient model to understand and quantify the role of this environment in determining the forces that drive the folding and misfolding of DNA and RNA. The model is used to design a new computational algorithm that can directly simulate folding and unfolding processes with atomic-level accuracy and significantly improved numerical efficiency. This enables full-scale structural dynamical simulations to study misfolding of DNAs, RNAs and their hybrids during transitions between double-stranded and single-stranded forms, processes critical to understanding their function and regulation in the cell. The education and outreach component of the project is aimed at restoring some of the natural excitement of discovery-based science into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. A scalable virtual platform for digital data-sharing and student collaboration is being developed to augment and enhance the student in-person laboratory experience. A mobile app designed as part of the project and running on iOS and Android devices and standard web browsers will provide an interface to the cloud-based collaborative environment. The platform will be utilized in outreach efforts to middle school and high school students in the local Southern California region, and will make available experimental designs that employ low-cost, readily-available, non-hazardous materials for scalable virtual collaboration and interactions among students and their teachers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to formulate rigorous theories and efficient computational strategies to understand the fundamental driving forces that dictate how nucleic acids fold, and the aberrant functions that result when they misfold. Based on an analytical formula for the conformational free energy of the sugar-phosphate backbone developed by Professor Mak, the folding algorithm developed in the project uses analytical and semi-analytical models to describe solvent- and counterion-mediated forces dictating the structures of nucleic acids, yielding a computationally efficient and highly ergodic numerical platform for folding DNAs and RNAs from scratch.  These studies focus on understanding and quantifying three specific types of solvent- and counterion-induced interactions: base stacking forces, back pairing interactions and complementary recognition mechanisms derived from them, and ion-induced specific and nonspecific intra-chain attractions. Both analytical theories and numerical simulations are being used to unravel and quantify these forces. With these interaction models integrated into a new Monte Carlo folding algorithm, the project focuses on studying two specific problems related to ssDNA and RNA physiology: (1) noncanonical secondary structures on mRNAs transcribed from overexpanded trinucleotide (CNG) or hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeats in the genome, and (2) the overaccumulation of R-loops as a function of sequence and loop length of the displaced single-stranded DNA as well as stability of the RNA/DNA hybrid and supercoiling in the upstream or downstream double-stranded DNA bounding these R-loops. Educational and outreach activities include the development of a web-accessible, scalable virtual environment to enable sharing of experimental designs and data, and facilitate collaborative interactions among students and instructors, to encourage and develop the excitement of inquiry-based science within chemistry laboratory courses and curricula."

Dr. Zaera's goal is to design a catalyst that can bring about the reaction of carbon-oxygen (C=O) bonds to alcohols, without affecting other bonds in the molecule.

One of the major challenges in catalysis is to achieve high selectivity toward the desired products. It has been shown that selectivity may be controlled by mixing two or more metals, an approach that is used in many industrial applications but not fully understood. The focus of this proposal is to help resolve some pending issues associated with bimetallic catalysis, including the determination of the contributions of electronic versus geometrical effects and the identification of the most active surface in terms of the degree of metal intermixing and the oxidation states of the constituent elements.  Dr. Zaera combines fundamental surface-science studies on the mechanistic details of the reactions with the design and evaluation of realistic catalysts. . Three types of interconnected experiments are involved : (1) kinetic measurements on model systems using high-flux molecular beams to emulate close-to-atmospheric pressures locally at specific surfaces while maintaining the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment necessary for their controlled preparation and characterization; (2) research of model systems in operando mode by combining kinetic measurements with mass spectrometry detection and characterization of the surface intermediates using infrared absorption spectroscopy; and (3) kinetic measurements with well-defined supported catalysts made by using colloidal and other nanotechnologies.  Broader impacts of the research result for an improved understanding of catalytic selectivity, which translates into more efficient hydrogenation catalysts particularly important to the industrial production of fine chemicals. Broader impacts are also made in curriculum development by providing data to illustrate basic principles in kinetics, catalysis, and nanoparticle synthesis for undergraduate and graduate classes.

These receptors are part of the innate immune system that recognizes several pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns.  The molecular mechanism of clustering and diffusion within the membrane upon chemically-defined ligand binding events will be measured for two PRRs:  receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).  Both PRRs share a subset of ligands, and have been shown to exhibit receptor ""cross talk,"" as evidenced by downstream protein phosphorylation (i.e., signaling).  The project is using single particle tracking methods to measure the diffusion of TLR4 and elucidate the role of chemically-characterized ligands in affecting the diffusion of RAGE and TLR4. The RAGE and TLR4 association in the cell membrane is measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Evidence for an association of these two receptors within the membrane has not been reported. It is hypothesized that a direct interaction between RAGE and TLR4 may be an important mechanism of their function, and that diffusion is an important regulator of these interactions. The proposed work is generating a foundation for understanding the molecular biophysical aspects of PRRs' molecular function that will add to the available data on the downstream signaling of these receptors."

Smith from the University of Akron to investigate lipid regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. The surface of living cells is composed of a lipid membrane embedded with thousands of protein receptors. Dynamic associations between membrane proteins and lipids are integral to function, but resolving these interactions has proven to be extremely challenging. This project applies advanced fluorescence methods, and single-molecule imaging to measure lipid-protein interactions in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and a class of membrane proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RTKs are integral membrane proteins that regulate cell growth and differentiation. The focus of this project is on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. Integral with these research objectives is an education and broader impacts program that enhances STEM education at the University of Akron and provides materials and curriculum for enhanced laboratory instruction across the country. This includes the development of a 3D-printable, smartphone spectrometer (the SpecPhone) for implementation in university laboratory courses. The low cost and simplicity of the SpecPhone also make it accessible to K-12 students and citizens so that they can engage in real-world science problems.  The broader impacts work creates new curriculum and teacher training workshops for K-12 STEM education, to participate in local Maker Fairs, and to develop protocols for a transformative citizen science project in the Lake Erie watershed.<br/><br/>Lipids solvate membrane proteins and, in many cases, regulate their activity through direct, specific contacts. Many lipid-protein interactions are inferred from static structures or computer simulations; however, there is little experimental data to verify these interactions in situ and determine their kinetic and thermodynamic stability. This project uses advanced fluorescence methods, including pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) and single-molecule imaging to measure molecular associations in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Both the extracellular domain (ECD) and the intracellular domain (ICD) of RTKs associate directly with the plasma membrane, but the chemical details of the associations are not well-understood. This project focuses on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. The central hypothesis is that anionic lipids bind these proteins and regulate their structure and activity. To test this hypothesis, we determine the affinity and specificity of anionic lipid binding to EGFR in model supported lipid bilayers. We also investigate the regulation of EphA2 structure and dynamics by anionic lipids in model membranes. Finally, we resolve the functional role of anionic lipid binding to EGFR. Achieving these objectives contributes to a systematic understanding of how the lipid-protein interface is affected by parameters like lipid charge, headgroup structure, solvent pH, and salt effects. The results significantly advance our understanding of the chemical interactions that guide cell communication.

Catalysts are often employed to generate environmentally friendly fuels, such as hydrogen which burns cleanly to water, and are also used to produce value-added chemicals, like carbon monoxide and methanol which can be made from sustainable crop sources. Because of the importance, catalyst function is a major driving force of research in the chemistry community. Transition metals and transition metal oxides possess many of the desired chemical properties for catalysts that can activate the bonds in CO2, H2O and CH4, which are particularly promising feedstocks for a more sustainable production of fuels and value-added chemicals.  These metals and their oxides can be especially active as small atomic clusters in the 0.00000005 inch or nanometer size range. Nanoclusters exhibit enhanced reactivity due to their unique geometric and electronic characteristics such as under-coordinated surface atoms, modified inter-atomic spacings and large surface to volume ratio.  In this project, Drs. Buratto, Bowers and Metiu produce model catalysts of both metals and metal oxides by deposition of well-defined, atomically-precise nanoclusters from the gas phase onto metal and metal oxide supports. These model systems are then tested for their reactivity in the production of hydrogen and methanol, important as both clean-burning fuels and chemical feedstocks. The research team's unique capability to control nanocluster composition atom-by-atom provides the requisite level of detail to understand the chemistry on the atomic level and provides important insight into the development of new catalytic systems. Drs. Buratto, Bowers and Metiu and graduate students supported by this project are active in outreach to high school students in the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties to discuss their research and its impact as well as promote science education.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Buratto, Bowers and Metiu prepare, characterize, and test two new classes of nanoscale catalysts based on the atom-by-atom assembly of small bimetallic and metal oxide clusters having one feature in common; they have very small, isolated, well-defined, catalytically-active sites and enhanced catalytic activity.  The research centers on the preparation of well-defined PdAun and PtSnm clusters supported on single crystal TiO2(110) and well-defined FexOy supported a single crystal Pt(111) in the inverse catalyst geometry. These model systems are prepared by depositing mass-selected clusters from the gas phase onto single crystal surfaces to control catalyst size and composition. Samples are then studied in ultra-high vacuum by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to determine composition and structure.  Temperature programmed reaction (TPR) is used to probe the activity to the water gas shift reaction, CO oxidation, and methanol synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate the structure of the clusters, their XPS spectrum and their chemical activity, and these data are then compared to experiment. The results are used to develop a detailed fundamental understanding of the catalytic chemistry at the atomic level that will in turn help optimize important industrial processes, and improve the performance of the existing catalysts or uncover new ones.  The research groups of Drs. Buratto, Bowers and Metiu are committed to K-12 outreach and the promotion of science in general. They are incorporating their research in heterogeneous catalysis into the University of California Santa Barbara's (UCSB's )5th grade outreach program.  This program brings 5th grade students from elementary schools in the Santa Barbara area to the UCSB campus for hands-on science activities.  The research team is also working with the teachers to develop a lesson in catalysis that is appropriate for the 5th grade curriculum and then incorporate it into the outreach program.  In addition, graduate students supported by this project are active in outreach to high school students in the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties to discuss their research and its impact, as well as to promote science education."

The principal investigator is Katelynn Perrault of Chaminade University of Honolulu. She is developing analytical approaches for measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a class of chemicals most commonly associated with odor analysis. A comprehensive technique that permits two independent methods of separation is used to analyze mixtures of volatiles. In addition, statistical procedures are defined to verify the accurate selection of marker compounds given various levels of sample complexity. These approaches may improve future studies on VOCs in forensic science, defense, and other natural science applications. Through the integration of this research with teaching practices and community outreach, Dr. Perrault contributes to the redressing of educational and career access disparities for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) and other underserved minorities.<br/><br/>The project focuses on leveraging a reverse fill/flush (RFF) flow modulator with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) as a tool for improving VOC characterization from complex samples. Chemical measurement of complex VOC matrices is analytically challenging because they are comprised of numerous compounds from different chemical classes, are highly varied in concentration, and have low matrix specificity. The specific aims of this study include the development of procedures for VOC method translation from a GC-MS instrument to a GCxGC-MS instrument using modulation retrofitting.  The research team also investigates GCxGC-MS chemometric feature selections on a reference VOC collection with simulated challenges and demonstrates the developed approach on real samples exhibiting high inter-sample VOC variation.  Finally, the team conducts the first interdisciplinary study on interpretation of multidimensional chromatographic output by non-specialists to improve communication of data to broader audiences and stakeholders. This program provides a strong analytical basis for the chemical measurement of VOC profiles using GCxGC-MS with RFF to be used in  chemical applications. The educational objective of this work is to implement professional development programs that promote career readiness and growth opportunities for students entering the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce.

The goal of the project is to develop a new type of microscope with unprecedented space and time resolution. The Landes group's new microscope allows the study of how rare events impact the efficiency of porous materials that are important for catalysis, separations science, corrosion, and biology. It has been established that it is possible to manipulate light as it interacts with molecules and proteins. For example, Professor Landes has already shown that by shaping light's phase, events faster than the camera frame rate can be imaged. By incorporating new mathematical and physical tools, the current project will result in a new instrument to image and track fast dynamics in porous materials with optimized 3-D space and time resolution. The interdisciplinary nature of this research effort provides participating students with a unique experience at the interface of spectroscopy and materials science, as well as image processing and modern information theory, and continues the strong history of cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at Rice University. This grant supports Professor Landes to provide training opportunities to high school teachers to incorporate cutting edge science into their course materials, as well as her new effort to create a summer scientific programming course. <br/><br/>Recently, a new microscopy technique called super temporal-resolved microscopy (STREM) was developed. Proof-of-concept measurements showed that STREM can improve the time resolution of traditional wide-field cameras by at least twenty times. This development, if combined with recent advances in 3-D imaging methods and signal processing, represents an opportunity to resolve the multiscale, nonlinear dynamics that drive a range of interfacial materials properties. Thus, the current project's objective is to develop and optimize 4-D STREM, a chemical imaging method for quantifying the nonlinear dynamics and structures in porous materials. It is hypothesized that better 3-D sub-diffraction spatial information, coupled with improved time resolution and signal processing algorithms, reveals heterogeneous mass transport, chemical, and biological mechanisms occurring at porous interfaces. The project will involve innovations in both hardware and software to improve the temporal and 2-D spatial resolution. Additionally, a new algorithm is to be developed to track in 3-D. Finally, the new microscope is to be used to acquire and curate a machine learning library capable of differentiating among common analyte, sample, and instrument conditions. A new instrument optimized for characterizing the multiscalar physics and chemistry that underlie separations in porous media, by improving both spatial and temporal resolution is obtained in this project. Further, the project will result in new algorithms to extract information from large 3-D data sets. In terms of applications, a more detailed description of mass transport in pores and channels is a step towards predictive separations, which are currently optimized empirically, amounting to billions of dollars each year for industry, government, and academic purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar energy is the most abundant form of renewable energy on earth, but is limited by a discontinuous supply. It is therefore critical to develop a way to harness and store solar energy as an energy dense chemical fuel that is compatible with our current infrastructure. Through a process called artificial photosynthesis (AP), sunlight is harnessed and used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas is used directly as a fuel, or is combined with oxygen in a hydrogen fuel cell to generate electricity. Owing to expensive materials and inefficient catalysts, hydrogen generation through AP is significantly more expensive than hydrogen generated from fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen fuel cells to convert solar fuels into electricity is also limited by the use of expensive materials (platinum). In this project, Dr. William R. McNamara devises a photocatalytic system for hydrogen generation using cost-effective iron catalysts. The use of inexpensive iron catalysts for the efficient reduction of oxygen gas in hydrogen fuel cells is also investigated. Within this project, several outreach activities promote the development of future generations of scientists. Dr. McNamara is conducting an after-school program at a local public high school with a high concentration of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through this program students actively conduct research in a meaningful and accessible way. These activities advance public scientific literacy while encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue careers in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the National Science Foundation supports the effort of Dr. William R. McNamara at the College of William and Mary towards the development of inexpensive materials for both photocatalytic hydrogen generation and the oxygen reduction reaction of hydrogen fuel cells. The immobilization of robust iron polypyridyl hydrogen generation catalysts on charge-separating supports (carbon nanotubes, TiO2 and SrTiO3) is characterized using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy. Hydrogen generation is promoted using an LED photolysis system and analyzed with gas chromatography. In order to decrease cost and improve the widespread applicability of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, the use of naturally occurring humic substances to replace traditional sacrificial donors is also investigated. Additionally, iron polypyridyl sulfinate catalysts are examined for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cells. Rotating ring disk voltammetry (RRDV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) are used to evaluate catalytic performance. Rigorous treatment of the data using foot-of-the-wave analysis (FOWA) is also employed to better understand mechanism. Funding from the NSF provides for the training of 15 different students (primarily undergraduates) in this multi-disciplinary research effort. Additionally, Dr. McNamara conducts an after-school research program at a local public high school with a high concentration of underrepresented groups in science.

Because one electron reactions (radical reactions) are traditionally viewed as highly reactive and difficult to control, the goal of this research is to better understand fundamental properties of radical initiations to engineer mild and user-friendly experimental protocols.  Many structures that can be accessed via radical chemistry are found in drugs, vitamins, materials and polymers, and so new strategies for radical initiation may have a positive impact on many fields of science that directly benefit society.  The project involves monitoring radical reactions in real-time to understand chemical behavior.  The resulting reaction data is used to develop educational materials for undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory and lecture courses. In addition, through industrial partnerships, volumes of authentic reaction data is collected and refined to develop a repository of undergraduate/graduate educational materials that are made available to educators throughout the Nation.   <br/><br/>Arenes and heteroarenes are common structures with many desirable materials.  Strategies for their rapid diversification are in demand. Radical carbon-hydrogen functionalization offers the ability to directly modify aromatic carbon hydrogen bonds via either nucleophilic or electrophilic processes, although uncontrolled reactivity is common to intermolecular processes.  This project involves two discrete aims to study fundamental physical properties that affect rates of radical initiation for synthetically important reactions.  The first focuses on developing catalyst systems that use silver ion, as an oxidant, and exogenous pyridine ligands in a novel way to control the rates of radical initiation for intermolecular nucleophilic functionalization of heteroarenes. Catalyst redox properties are studied electrochemically, and this data is correlated with global reaction rates to inform the development of optimum catalyst/oxidant systems.  The second aim involves the iron-catalyzed reduction of nitrogen-oxygen bonds to promote intermolecular radical amination of arenes through an electrophilic process.  The electronic properties of various nitrogen-radical precursors are examined to develop efficient strategies that combine mild initiation with reliable rates of initiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators are paying special attention to the details of the process by which solar energy is converted to chemical forms of energy, hoping to catch this crucial energy conversion event in the act, in real time. The work is having a broader impact through the development of new technologies for visualizing chemical events on a very fine scale, and also through the dissemination of their results in a variety of public media. The work is furthering innovation through the invention of new scientific tools that are being moved toward commercial development.  In addition to directly contributing to the educational development of students involved in the center's research, CaSTL organizes and participates in a variety of formal and informal science education activities, targeting audiences with varying educational backgrounds. Examples include summer schools for the broader chemistry community, the California State Summer School for Math and Science (COSMOS) aimed at high school students, and a variety of informal science education activities, such as an afterschool program at the Boys and Girls Club.<br/><br/>During this funding period, CaSTL will continue development of an all-optical version of a working chemiscope, along with versions that combine optics with scan probe microscopes, and the ultimate observation of molecular motions and transformations on a femtosecond-Angstrom spatiotemporal scale. The group is moving toward application of this tool to specific chemical problems, in particular plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. The excitation of collective electrons, the formation of hot electrons, their thermalization and scattering on interfaces, injection of electrons or holes into catalytic molecular centers and the subsequent breaking and making of bonds are targeted for capturing in space-time. Through time-resolved photoelectron emission microscopy (tr-PEEM) and 2-photon photoemission (tr-2PP) on catalytic metal clusters and hetero-structures, they are working to fully characterize the space-time dynamics initiated on the metal side upon excitation of plasmons. The complete time course of the photocatalyzed molecular transformation on the surface side is made possible using space-time-resolved surface-enhanced nonlinear coherent spectroscopy. Theoretical investigations are being used to guide the development and refinement of capabilities of this unique toolset.

Aerosol particles in marine environments play a critical role in controlling cloud formation and lifetime, atmospheric chemical composition, surface temperature and precipitation patterns, and human and ecosystem health. CAICE research is providing new insights into aerosol chemistry which will enable more robust predictions on the impact of aerosol particles on air quality, climate, and the hydrologic cycle.  In addition to illustrating the central role of chemistry in environmental processes that impacts research disciplines spanning from physical oceanography to marine biology, CAICE is actively developing new experimental and computational tools with applications in chemical research involving soft materials, nanomaterials, small sensor development, and colloidal science. Beyond their research experience, students involved in CAICE receive interdisciplinary training in research ethics, effective science communication, and entrepreneurialism, equipping them with the required tools to address future grand challenges in science.

These signature experiments serve to guide molecular level investigations through the distillation of chemical complexity and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be used to replicate the complex atmospheric interfaces.  To accomplish these goals, CAICE research is divided into three research themes: 1) Production and characterization of marine aerosol particles: Replicating the chemical complexity of the ocean-atmosphere system in the laboratory, 2) Chemical reactions at environmental interfaces: Gas and aerosol transformations, 3) Molecular level impacts of marine aerosols on water uptake and ice nucleation.

With cameras, pictures can be taken that show colors to help identify objects; for example, grass is green and sky is blue.  However, to look at molecules, more specific information is needed about the ""colors"" that molecules absorb. For many molecules, this absorption occurs in the infrared region of light.  To look at these infrared colors, traditional cameras are not very good so methods that can obtain pictures without cameras are necessary.  Professor Baldelli and Professor Kelly are developing a new type of microscope to figure out the surface image of surface molecules.  The results of this new microscope are useful to all researchers interested in surfaces related to biomaterials, energy, and environmental topics. For example, it can be used to study the distribution of lipid molecules on cell membranes that controls proteins moving in and out of cells, which in turn regulate cell growth and signaling. It can also be used to look at chemical dopants on a thin film that accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, an important step in efficient energy conversion. The research project also presents a valuable opportunity to learn and experience collaborative multidisciplinary research -- a current emphasis of science and engineering education.  The topics and research project have many components to encourage undergraduate and high school students into the research, including instrument building, data analysis and interpretation, and research presentations.  This later point is an important aspect since it builds much confidence in the younger students and scientist.<br/><br/>Professors Baldelli and Kelly are developing a new state-of-the-art surface spectroscopic imaging microscope to study the molecular, spatial, and temporal evolution of patterns and chemical heterogeneity present in many fundamental and technologically important systems. This new CS-SFG (compressive sensing-sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy) imaging technique utilizes a digital mirror device (DMD).  The DMD is the heart of the DLP projector and flat screen displays.  It is a 2-D array of mirrors that reflects the SFG image onto a detector.  Using computer control and a random pattern generator, the signal intensity changes depending on which mirrors are reflecting toward the detector.  Each pattern results from 50% of the randomly chosen mirrors being turned on for each measurement.  After many such measurements, the image is reconstructed based on the signal and the known mirror pattern.  CS allows for efficient image acquisition where only a few percent of the total information is necessary to faithfully reconstruct the surface features.  Two configurations broad-band and narrow-band IR are set up to evaluate the effect on the image reconstruction.  In addition the detection system incorporates heterodyne detection to extract phase information forth monolayer signal.  This new capability allows for alternate imaging schemes and orientation analysis.  The effect of compression algorithms and quantitative analysis ultimately aid in the interpretation of heterogeneous monolayer films on surfaces. The CS-SFG microscope will be a significant improvement over current approaches that either use probe areas on the order of a millimeter or acquire the full hyperspectral data cube but at considerable expense in sample throughput. Once demonstrated, Professors Baldelli and Kelly are to employ this microscope to investigate the molecular-level static and dynamic details of chemical patterns (such as lipid domains) formed under the control condition of lithography and the transfer of films to solid substrates via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The research project provides both graduate students and local high school students with highly interdisciplinary training in chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science."

Professor Mitchell-Koch is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Wichita State University, and Professor Nguyen is a faculty member in the Department of Physics at Virginia Tech. Their research focuses on the dynamics or movement of solvent molecules around enzymes. Enzymes are molecules that effect chemical reactions in living systems. They do so with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. Their ability to perform these tasks depends on their ability to be flexible. This flexibility is strongly influenced by interactions between the surface of the enzyme and the solvent it is dissolved in, and in particular how well different parts of the enzyme can ""slip through"" that solvent. Because of the importance of these interactions, the design of new artificial enzymes relies on understanding how enzymes influence the movement of solvent molecules on their surface and in turn how those features influence how the enzyme moves and behaves. With this in mind, Professor Nguyen is developing unique methods that allow his group to gather data on both solvent movement and movement within the enzyme at the same time. To compliment these efforts, Professor Mitchell-Koch employs computational chemistry techniques to provide insights into how specific features of the enzymes surface change the way the surrounding solvent behaves and ultimately improve performance of the enzyme. In this way, the work is poised to guide protein engineering and design of new biocatalysts for greener production (lower energy costs, higher atom efficiency) of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The research provides valuable opportunities and resources for interdisciplinary training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students. Professors Mitchell-Koch and Nguyen have a strong track record of training undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented groups in STEM, and they will continue to recruit and train students to contribute to our nation's capacity for science and technology. Their outreach activities with middle school and high school students as a part of the project will strengthen the impacts of the research.<br/><br/>Solvent-compatible enzymes (those that function in organic solvents) present an ideal platform for studying connections between interfacial solvent dynamics and molecular structure, dynamics, and mechanism, since enzymatic activity is influenced by protein conformational dynamics. The project employs the world's highest precision, highest sensitivity and largest continuous-frequency gigahertz to terahertz spectrometer (with power signal-to-noise up to 1015 and spectral resolution less than 100 Hz), combined with molecular dynamics simulations to map protein solvation and molecular interactions around the surface of biomolecules. Solvents with differing chemical properties serve as variables, altering intermolecular interactions with the surface that in turn modify solvent dynamics. Literature reports support a connection between interfacial solvent dynamics and protein dynamics in both aqueous solutions and organic solvents. In this effort, the PIs hypothesize that there is a feedback loop between structure-modified solvent dynamics and solvent dynamics-protein dynamics that may serve as a protein design principle. A distinction in the work is that it focuses on local (region-specific) solvation environments (mapped around the entire protein) rather than analyzing solvation layer properties as a whole (or relying on bulk solvent characteristics), as it is thought that these local effects are the primary arbitrators of solvent dynamics-biomolecular structure-dynamics connections. The project undertakes the first comprehensive study of organic solvent dynamics at the enzyme interface, and their relationship to enzyme structure-dynamics-activity, tying results to measured collective motions and published kinetics values. Since solvation processes are also critical in charge transfer (electron and proton transfer), substrate transport, and molecular recognition, it is imperative to characterize relationships between organic and aqueous solvent dynamics and surface-solvent interactions to inform design of many interfaces, from functional materials to de novo proteins. Interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate researchers with diverse backgrounds is provided in the Mitchell-Koch and Nguyen laboratories. Outreach activities provide awareness of terahertz research, dynamics of biomolecules, and computational chemistry methods to the public and community groups. The Summer NanoCamp at Virginia Tech gives students, including those in under-represented groups, their parents/guardians, and school teachers, the ability to participate in activities designed to foster engagement and interest in nanoscience, including gigahertz to terahertz science. A workshop on Brownian motion will provide experimental observations and videos of simulations data, reaching middle school girls at annual Expanding Your Horizons events at Wichita State. This program will also be available in K-12 outreach presentations. Assessment of broader impacts includes longitudinal tracking of research students and teacher/student/parent surveys for outreach activities."

In this research, structural factors which control the release of N2 molecules within the crystal are identified. As part of this research, solid-state photoreactivity of these compounds is investigated by performing laser flash photolysis of nanocrystals. These studies are designed to characterize the transients formed within the crystals and determine the solid-state kinetics of these transients.  X-ray crystallography and photoproduct identification are critical elements of this study. Solid-state reaction mechanisms are supported by quantum chemical calculations.

Synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century; indeed, it is responsible for feeding half the world?s population. It also consumes more than 2% of the World?s energy.  Unfortunately, only 15% of the ammonia created and converted into fertilizer is useful for food production. As much as 50% of the ammonia produced ends up in the air or in water supplies. The fate and impact of the ammonia released into the atmosphere is largely unknown however, mitigating the loss of ammonia produced could have a major economic impact on food producers as well as reducing negative effects of runoff on water supplies. Modeling results suggest a catalytic role for ammonia in transforming sulfur oxides into particles that generate clouds. Clouds in turn modulate Earth's radiation balance. Understanding particle formation is one of the grand challenges associated with climate and weather modeling. This work is aimed at understanding the role of ammonia in the environment, especially in terms of energy consumption, food production and clean water supplies.  The project is also expected to contribute to the technological workforce; students gain experience with inventing and applying forefront tools for probing surfaces. Data are shared with local secondary schools through the chemistry department COOP program; the Shultz laboratory is a host for COOP students.<br/><br/>This project combines emerging spectroscopic techniques with surface science to probe ammonia-surface interactions. Surfaces play an outsized role both in soil-ammonia and ammonia-atmospheric-aerosol interactions.

There is one technique that meets the challenge: nonlinear, surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy coupled with nonlinear interferometry. Applying this technique to soil and aerosol interfaces is expected to yield insight into interactions that impact water and air quality. Additionally, a deeper understanding of soil chemistry could lead to improved fertilizer formulations for controlled release impacting both food and water supplies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partial oxidation of organic chemicals on metal surfaces (catalysts) is an extensively used catalytic reaction. However, the atomic-level details of these seemingly straightforward oxidation reactions have remained elusive.  Many aspects of the metal surface factor in to its reactivity.  Among them, the arrangements of metal atoms, and the abundance of various oxygen-containing species, play key roles.  In this project, Dr. Dan Killelea of Loyola University Chicago (LUC) and his research group are studying how the surface structures and reactivity of these metal catalysts change under reaction conditions.  Significantly, this project also examines subsurface oxygen, which are oxygen atoms dissolved into the near-surface layers of the solid catalysts.  Although subsurface oxygen atoms may not be reactants themselves, they may affect the reactivity and properties of the surface in important ways.  While surface chemistry research is central to this proposal, this project broadens participation in science outreach efforts to the Chicago Public Schools (CPS).  One goal of this project is to support students of under-represented socioeconomic status to develop their interest in scientific careers.  Through this project, LUC students engage CPS students in several contexts: the high school lab, tours of LUC facilities, and a Summer Internship Program.  Additional engagement and outreach efforts include hosting CPS student meetings with admissions counselors from local universities, and trips to Argonne National Laboratory. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Dan Killelea of Loyola University Chicago is advancing the understanding of the behavior of subsurface oxygen in metals by investigating its formation, and physical and chemical effects in three catalytic metals: rhodium, palladium, and platinum.  In each, subsurface oxygen is thought to contribute to the selectivity of catalytic processes, but the origins of their activity remain unclear.  The reactivity of the metals with various oxygen abundances is measured and the formation of subsurface oxygen is quantified with a combination of surface science techniques.  The changes in the surface structures of the oxidized metals are directly observed using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).  In addition to the STM images, density functional theory (DFT) is used to identify stable structures of surface and subsurface oxygen atoms on these metals and their effects.  The data obtained with STM is complemented with other surface science measurements.  In concert, these provide a detailed picture of the ensemble-averaged physical and chemical properties of metal surfaces with subsurface oxygen.  The results of this project advance surface catalysis by providing much needed fundamental information about subsurface oxygen and reveal the importance of it in industrially relevant heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.  Additionally, support from the NSF strengthens active collaborations with researchers in The Netherlands, Tulsa, and Chicago, as well as outreach efforts to local Chicago Public High Schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research strategy is to carry out Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based simulations on two classes of ENPs: Aqueous aluminum hydroxides modeled as Giant Aluminum Polycations (GAPs) and mineral-water interfaces modeled as Periodic Slab Models (PSMs). Reactivity questions that are suited to each model category are identified, and systematic simulation experiments are designed using comparisons to isolate what controls reactivity. The projects are designed to develop atomistic simulations results of both GAPs and PSMs into new conceptual models for ENP reactivity, a goal that will support or dispel existing theories. For this purpose, the distinctions between the models will be exploited, for example, GAPs are ideal models for tracking reactivity with orbital interactions because they are truly nanoparticulate, and fewer electronic states are expected to participate in interfacial bonding. Also, these aluminum hydroxides do not have d electrons, so they have a less complicated electronic structure than similarly structured iron hydroxides. Meanwhile, the PSM geometry is ideal for probing how adsorption-induced long range bond relaxation and relative energetics can be captured in a Bond Valence (BV) framework. Several of the proposed simulations will involve first time calculations, such as the later described DFT + COSMO (conduction-like screening model)+ (delta)H2O (partial explicit hydration) method for simulating the aqueous Al30 (GAP) and deriving surface-specific Hubbard U corrections to accurately model PSMs comprised of strongly correlated mineral oxides.<br/> <br/>The proposed work will enable improved predictions about the sequestration of aqueous contaminants that could ultimately lead to new water remediation strategies. Each research project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and a major emphasis will be placed on the ""Never Too Late to Learn"" (NTLL) program and its mission to engage community college students in education and research activities that will extend opportunities to train them as the next generation scientists. Efforts to organize research outcomes into DFT databases that will be reported in the associated Data Management Plan, ensure that the fundamental information obtained from the atomistic simulations will be disseminated to the research community, regardless of any failure to pioneer the proposed conceptual models. The unified research and education plans are suited to principal investigator's strengths, background, and commitment to develop quantum nanogeochemistry as a vital field in environmental chemical science."

A fundamental challenge for the chemical sciences is to bridge the gap between the ability to study and manipulate matter at the atomistic scale with the desire to understand and predict properties at a macroscopic scale. Recently, there has been an immense increase in high-throughput and high-resolution technologies for experimental observation. In addition there is an increase in high-performance techniques to simulate molecular systems at a microscopic level. These advances have resulted in a vast and ever-increasing amounts of high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a recent surge of interest in data analysis techniques. In particular, techniques that extract essential features, collective variables or representative states from simulations. These simulation data have to be reconciles with experimental data. However, with very few exceptions, these reconciling techniques are purely descriptive and do not allow the formulation of general principles regulating the macroscopic behavior. Furthermore it is difficult to scale up towards significantly larger and more complex systems. This project develops a new and general approach to address this challenge. The approaches are applicable to very different chemical systems, ranging from signal transduction in cells, over heterogeneous catalysis to the design of polymer brushes. The proposed research impacts a large interdisciplinary community of students and researchers in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. The project undertakes curriculum development in computational and mathematical methods applied to chemical systems. Curriculum development includes undergraduate and graduate courses. The project is also recruiting and mentoring women and minority undergraduate and graduate students. This activity is conducted through a collaboration with the Tapia Center at Rice University.<br/><br/>The project is developing a general framework to obtain the effective dynamical models (structure, equations and parameters) governing molecular systems. The key hypothesis is that, in order to be able to understand and model macroscopic systems, there is a need to use purely descriptive models to define generative models from data. Models are developed at the mesoscale from microscale simulations and multiscale experimental data. The approach is fundamentally different from available coarse-graining techniques or model reduction methods. Both the form of the macroscopic model as well as the effective dynamical equations are learned from data. Functional building blocks that can be embedded in higher order simulations are generated in order to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic systems. The method investigates if and how relatively general organizing principles emerge from the interactions of a multitude of atomic degrees of freedoms in different chemical systems. This modeling approach has the potential to serve as a keystone to integrate vast amounts of chemical data into quantitative, mechanistic and comprehensible models. Such models are able to explain how different molecular components organize and interact as a function of time and space in performing functions at the macroscopic scale."

This enables new approaches to making molecules in a streamlined and sustainable way. These new approaches will have impact on modern medicine and manufacturing, including drug discovery and materials science. CCHF will connect to scientists in colleges and companies, large and small, across the globe, through online symposia as well as traditional conferences. CCHF will contribute teaching materials to facilitate the inclusion of C-H functionalization into curricula and engage with the public in a broad range of activities, including large public science festivals, across the United States. <br/><br/>The goal of the CCHF is to revolutionize organic synthesis by developing chemistries for C-H Functionalization. While the ubiquity of C-H bonds in organic molecules is a key advantage in the CCHF approach, the similarity in bond energy makes selective product formation a challenging and stimulating problem. To date, the most effective strategies have relied on properties inherent to the substrate, either through steric and electronic bias, or through reagent-chelation and direction to specific C-H bonds. Moving forward, the CCHF will also explore catalyst control of selectivity through sophisticated reaction design. These efforts will be focused on three strategies to impart selection; 1) catalyst-controlled site selection: employing small molecule catalysts with ligand frameworks capable of controlling substrate trajectories to selectively form single products, 2) substrate coordination assisted site selection: designing a suite of catalysts and ligands that can weakly assemble around a substrate and deliver reagents to specific C-H bonds, 3) bio-inspired catalyst site selection: employing and repurposing enzymes to selectively functionalize an expanded scope of substrates. The Center will demonstrate the power of these distinct strategies in the context of natural products synthesis, drug discovery and preparation, creation of organic materials, and the preparation of agrochemicals. Immersion in a collaborative environment such as the CCHF will provide an excellent forum to prepare Center members for future participation in interdisciplinary team science, and the Center will deliver programming to enhance this experience. CCHF will also educate the broader scientific community on how to best deploy C-H functionalization strategies and tactics to solve synthetic problems via activities such as the Virtual Frontiers of C-H Functionalization virtual symposia and the Organic Pedagogical Electronic Network (OPEN) which distributes educational materials related to C-H functionalization. The CCHF is committed to be actively engaged in broadening participation, offering programs such as the Network for Diversity in Chemical Research (NDCR). The primary goal of the NDCR is to assist faculty in their early career by offering research and networking opportunities with CCHF scientists."

The broader impacts of the Center include interdisciplinary technical training for young scientists across emerging areas of polymer chemistry, and communication and entrepreneurship experiences that position Center trainees for future careers. Finally, the Center partners with community colleges to increase public awareness of the societal impact of science innovation while simultaneously encouraging broader participation in the sciences by communicating the range of career opportunities available to the diverse community college population.<br/><br/>The scope of MONET comprises quantitative structure-activity relationships that relate polymer network toughness to the toughness of individual network strands, the molecular architecture of the network, and the mechanism and spatial organization of dynamic strand exchange reactions. These objectives are pursued through a unique combination of methods, including precision polymer synthesis, single molecule spectroscopy, coordination chemistry, photochemical switching, and the development and application of new theoretical models and methods.

The combined gains in fundamental knowledge, technical capability, and informatics strategy address a major chemical knowledge gap. MONET addresses the role of precisely controlled polymer chain length, the molecular mechanical response of a polymer chain, and the mechanisms by which polymer strands exchange in dynamic networks, as well as the influence of molecular scale network defects on each. The knowledge gained informs strategies to bring remarkable properties to polymer networks, by treating them as complex but understandable chemical systems that can be harnessed to produce currently inaccessible collective properties. Key broader impacts of this award include the development of a polymer network database, technical training and professional development for developing scientists, and science communication to diverse audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NIR hyperspectral imaging has been widely used for nondestructive quality inspection; however, existing methods cannot examine a specimen with a complicated internal structure or detect the chemical impurities buried deep inside a 3-D volume because the depth information is lost in the recorded 2-D projection images. Traditional approaches to 3-D tomographic imaging require a scanning mechanism, which significantly increases the data acquisition time and the complexity of an instrument. Professor Sung and his group is developing instruments using a technique called snapshot tomography, which can acquire the 3-D tomogram in a single snapshot. By incorporating various wavelength-scan strategies, the new instruments can acquire the 4-D hyperspectral data at a high speed and good spatial resolution. The instruments, once developed, could potentially impact many industries by allowing nondestructive quality inspection of pharmaceutical, chemical, petrochemical, or agricultural products.  Applications such as improving human health by detecting counterfeit medicines or being used in failure analysis of 3-D integrated-circuit chips in solar cells or micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices are envisioned. Professor Sung strives to provide training opportunities to undergraduate researchers and K-12 students, the future generation of scientists and engineers.  He also works on incorporating cutting-edge science into course materials and is actively engaged in many on-campus programs to recruit more women and minority students into his group.<br/><br/>Professor Sung is developing a 4D NIR absorption and refractive index imaging where a wavelength-scanning light source is combined with a snapshot tomography technique that is enabled by a micro-lens array and digital holography. A common-path design is incorporated to further increase the robustness to environmental vibrations and a spatial light modulator to actively compensate for the chromatic aberration. For 4-D NIR emission imaging, a tunable bandpass filter or Fourier transform spectroscopy is combined with another snapshot tomography technique for luminescence light. The theoretical frameworks to be developed is believed to extend the application of diffraction tomography to more general classes of absorbing specimens and increase the accuracy of emission tomography by including the wave nature and the partial coherence of light in the image formation and reconstruction models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemists often use optical spectrometers (instruments that measure how molecules absorb, emit or scatter light)to obtain information about molecular structure. But as proteins are large molecules (hundreds or thousands of atoms) that are also flexible, it is very difficult to determine their structures from optical spectroscopy alone.  In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Casey Londergan of Haverford College is using a combination of experimental spectroscopy and computational chemistry to develop ""vibrational probe"" techniques for the determination of the structures and internal motions of proteins.  A vibrational probe is a small molecule that vibrates at a known frequency (typically corresponding to infrared light) when it is isolated, but exhibits a change in frequency when it interacts with other molecules (including other probes). One such probe being investigated is thiocyanate, which contains sulfur, carbon and nitrogen (SCN). By attaching SCN or other vibrational probes to different parts of the protein, Prof. Londergan hypothesizes that the changes in probe frequencies can be associated with changes in their local probe environment.  In principle, the vibrational probes thus report on local regions of the proteins and their interactions with other parts of the protein or with other molecules (water, dissolved ions, etc.). However, in order to interpret the experimentally observed probe frequency changes, computer simulations of the different protein shapes and local environments is necessary. This project is being conducted mainly by undergraduate students and is providing them with an interdisciplinary research experience with a network of local and international collaborators. This project also includes educational outreach activities, for example dance-based workshops and instructions designed to engender a more human-level understanding of proteins and their interactions. <br/><br/>This research project is focusing on a model regulatory protein (calmodulin), a model membrane protein (alpha-synuclein), and other proteins at the center of bacterial biosynthesis.  Well-sampled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to propose ensembles of structures, and then further simulations with vibrational probe groups explicitly included to produce simulated spectral lineshapes that can validate or help to re-weight the simulated structural ensembles.  The initial model associations between measured spectra and local probe environments are being developed based on the relatively broadly-used SCN probe group. As the methodology improves in accuracy, it will ultimately be used to provide quantitative interpretation of new data from less-used probe groups that this project will develop (e.g.,azido, isonitrile, alkyne, and nitro groups). Some of these novel probe groups' signals are more easily collected by Raman spectroscopy rather than infrared absorption.  This project's development of a quantitative vibrational probe methodology is likely to enable solutions to many important biomolecular problems where current data are underdetermined for representing the conformational distribution, which is of central importance in disordered and ""fuzzy"" protein systems(most of which are regulatory and/or disease-related species).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for determining the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. To be able to obtain data NMR spectrometers require a probe where the sample to be analyzed is placed. In a cryogenically cooled probe, a very cold liquid or gas is used to chill the environment. This chilling results in a significant increase in sensitivity and speeds up data collection while using smaller samples. This instrument to be located in a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists.  It is an integral part of research, research training and teaching at the University. The improved research infrastructure further enriches and facilitates the innovative efforts presently underway at this institution to broaden participation in science and engineering, especially by individuals from underrepresented groups (e. g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geography, etc.) through its integration into outreach at the pre-college level. Coursework at the undergraduate and postgraduate level is enriched.  Both KU students and students from other colleges and universities participating in undergraduate and graduate research training programs are able to access the new facilities.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) exploring strategies for fluorination of common functional groups; (b) preparing azulene-bridged organometallics as a platform fo charge delocalization and transport at the nanoscale; (c) focusing on catalysis and reaction engineering for resource-efficient chemical and fuel production from biomass and (d) synthesizing catalyts via carbon-carbon bond cleavage."

Simon M. Humphrey and Graeme Henkelman at the University of Texas at Austin, which focuses on the preparation and studies of new nano-catalyst materials. Catalysts reduce the total energy used in large-scale chemical processes, including the synthesis of fuels, polymers and textiles, drugs, and the remediation of environmental pollutants. Catalysts also reduce the amount of waste by-products that are generated. The majority of catalysts currently in use are based on precious metals, which are unfortunately also both scarce and expensive. Therefore, it is critically important to find ways to prepare modern catalysts that can operate using less total metal, whilst maintaining their catalytic performance. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, this project directly addresses these issues by studying the synthesis and properties of metallic nanoparticle catalysts that comprise only a few thousand atoms per entity; nanoparticles are attractive compared with bulk metals because they exhibit superior reactivity, as well as having very large surface areas compared to their volumes. The project also studies the use of scalable and environmentally-sustainable synthesis methods, such as microwave heating, to prepare new nanoparticle catalysts comprised of previously unstudied mixtures of precious metals. The fundamental properties of these new catalysts are assessed using experimental and theoretical (computational) methods, in order to understand how composition relates to performance improvements in real chemical reactions. The ultimate aim is to apply experimental and computational expertise to predict new catalyst compositions that should have optimal properties for given industrial processes. The project is also significantly enhanced through integration with an innovative new undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework in which undergraduates travel overseas to collaborate with world-renown research group. <br/><br/><br/>This highly collaborative synthetic and computational research program between the groups of Profs. Simon M. Humphrey and Graeme Henkelman at the University of Texas at Austin focuses on the synthesis and studies of new noble metal nanoparticle catalysts with unusual compositions. The major objectives of this research activity are to make direct connections between the structure and function of novel metallic nanoparticles that are comprised of unusual binary and ternary combinations of precious metals. There are significant intellectual challenges to achieve this goal. First, determining the atomic structure of supported multicomponent metal nanoparticles is difficult. A combination of electron microscopy, total X-ray scattering to generate pair distribution function data, extended X-ray fine structure spectroscopy, and temperature programmed desorption/reaction will be used to experimentally quantify structural parameters. This data will be used to inform realistic theoretical models at the atomic scale. Second, structural information with atomic detail is also critical to building theoretical models of active site, reactivity descriptors, and predictions of selectivity. It is also important to have feedback in terms of predictions from theory that can be tested experimentally, so that the models can be validated and calibrated. The ultimate goal of this work is to be able to rationally predict optimal structures and compositions of new catalysts that should have desired reactivity for specific applications. Meanwhile, differences between predictions and experimentally observed reactivity are equally valuable for improving the computational methods developed in this work. The project is also significantly enhanced through integration with an innovative new undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework (AIF). The AIF is an innovative and modern-thinking program that provides a fully immersive, scholarship-supported international exchange experience to UT Austin undergraduates. It provides students the unique opportunity to broaden their horizons by witnessing first-hand the global nature of science. The students involved in this program receive course credit for their research experiences and scholarships are provided to cover their basic cost-of-living expenses while doing research overseas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fungi are critical members of most ecosystems. Many fungi produce a diversity of secondary metabolites, chemical compounds that have important roles in their defense, communication between individuals of the same species, and communication between different species. Fungal secondary metabolites have also been used by humans for biomedical and agricultural applications, such as the antibiotic penicillin, the fungicide strobilurin, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin. However, identifying these compounds and understanding their ecological function remains difficult and labor intensive. This research project aims to implement new approaches for isolating and studying the chemicals produced by fungi, using methods including gene activation and metabololite profiling. These experiments contribute to an improved understanding of the complex chemical ecology of fungi. This work also has potential to identify novel secondary metabolites with practical applications.  The Loesgen Lab regularly participates in OSU's Discovery Days, a semiannual education fair that serves 3500 children from schools around Oregon. This project expands the lab's collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) and establishes an interactive exhibit that introduces children and their parents to natural products chemistry. Microbial chemistry is an interdisciplinary field with important ecological applications, and is thus very well positioned to serve as a vehicle for chemistry education.

Aim 1 establishes a method for de-repressing gene clusters using a novel class of chemical epigenetic modifying agents. Aim 2 uses metabolomics methods to analyze liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS), high performance two-dimensional NMR, and RNA expression data in order to detect and isolate newly expressed secondary metabolites. Aim 3 tests secondary metabolites for effects on bacterial, fungal, and plant growth in order to determine the likely ecological role of these molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anisotropy barriers to orientate molecular spins in discrete molecules of SIMs are large enough to display magnetic hysteresis. There have been active research efforts to design/prepare SIMs with large anisotropies and slow relaxations. Large separations between magnetic ground and excited states in SIMs are closely related to the large anisotropies and slow relaxation. It is a challenge to precisely determine the separations between magnetic ground and excited states, when the separations are more than 50 wavenumbers, and to spectroscopically probe magneto-phonon interactions leading to spin-lattice relaxation. This project investigates ways to directly determine magnetic separations more than 50 wavenumbers in SIMs and to probe magneto-phonon interactions.  Raman and far-infrared spectroscopies inside magnetic fields are to be used to characterize SIMs, demonstrating that the spectroscopies could be developed into effective methods to probe molecular magnetism."

Besides this role, DNA is also one of the most valuable tools in modern biotechnology.  Foundational technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing, as well as emerging technologies, such as DNA-encoded drug discovery, rely on the unique functions of DNA.  However, the usefulness of DNA-based tools is limited by DNA's susceptibility to destruction in a biological environment.  With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Aaron Leconte from the W. M. Keck Science Department of Claremont McKenna, Pitzer, and Scripps Colleges to develop proteins that can synthesize chemically-modified forms of DNA that are more stable than natural DNA in a biological environment.  Consequently, the modified DNAs have the potential to expand the applications of DNA-based tools, such as high throughput DNA sequencing and synthetic biology used in a number of therapeutic and clinical diagnostics.  Such research may benefit society by improving human health. Professor Leconte integrates research experiences in laboratory courses for undergraduate students to prepare these students for STEM graduate studies and careers. He is also developing videos that document the research experiences of current and former undergraduate students that can be used to inspire and attract more students to STEM studies.<br/> <br/>This research project seeks to develop mutant DNA polymerases capable of high fidelity synthesis of modified forms of DNA called M-DNA.  This DNA is resistant to nucleases.  M-DNAs are generally not amplified by native DNA polymerases. Mutant DNA polymerases capable of synthesizing long, modified DNAs have been identified only recently.  While these mutant DNA polymerases represent an exciting step forward, these enzymes make frequent errors, limiting their application. The research in the Leconte laboratory focuses on the characterization and engineering of a recently discovered mutant DNA polymerase, SFP1. Preliminary data suggest that this enzyme is capable of M-DNA synthesis and that it makes far fewer errors than other previously characterized M-DNA polymerases. The Leconte group develops high throughput sequencing methods that can quantitatively evaluate M-DNA synthesis.  The high-throughput sequencing data obtained by these methods inform engineering efforts to produce DNA polymerases that have a lower error frequency during M-DNA synthesis.  The new polymerases that can perform modified DNA synthesis with higher fidelity have the potential to enable an array of applications in fields that range from clinical diagnostics to synthetic biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Leopold at the University of Minnesota performs fundamental studies on the forces of attraction between molecules. These forces are ubiquitous in nature and their study underlies our understanding a wide variety of chemical phenomena. The work is done by creating small clusters of two or three molecules and studying their physical properties. By grouping only a few molecules at a time, the simplification needed to fully understand the attractive forces is achieved. This work identifies prototypical systems that provide the most useful basic information. Whenever possible, prototypes are chosen that contain molecules known or suspected of being active in the Earth's atmosphere, thus providing foundational knowledge for atmospheric science. The direct focus on atmospherically important problems produces basic information needed to rationally evaluate the impact of both natural and anthropogenic changes to the environment.  Additional impact is realized in the education of students and postdoctoral fellows who work on these problems.  This project continues to grow a broader set of collaborators at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs). The ability to collect a data  in a short time is conducive to allowing undergraduate students the opportunity to see a project through from beginning to end.<br/>  <br/>Microwave spectroscopy in a supersonic jet is used to determine molecular and electronic structure in small weakly bound complexes.

Quantum mechanical tunneling, when observed, offers experimental benchmarks with which to challenge theoretical chemical dynamics. Three-dimentional printing is explored as a convenient and inexpensive means of optimizing the design of the supersonic nozzles used to generate the chemical species of interest. The broader impact of this work lies, in part, in its elucidation of the fundamental interactions that govern solvation and determine the properties of matter.

At the molecular scale, GO can be described as a sheet of carbon atoms linked together, with oxygen atoms attached to carbon atoms in a few places. The sheet-like structure of GO is similar to graphite, another carbon material which is used in lubricants and pencil leads. The ""slipperiness"" of graphite derives from the tiny sheets of carbon material sliding past each other. Professor Kumar's interest in GO is not for its lubrication abilities, but because it can be used to adsorb other molecules and ions (for example impurities in water), or be used in other technologies like batteries, fuel cells and catalysts. An interesting feature of GO is that its chemical properties are ""tunable.""  That is, by varying the number of oxygen atoms attached to the carbon sheet, different reactivities result. Professor Kumar and her students are developing computer models to simulate the properties and behavior of various kinds of GO, and their interactions with different molecules and liquids.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are being trained in theoretical and computational chemistry ranging from fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics to computational algorithms and modeling. Professor Kumar develops molecular simulation modules as part of the undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum at her university. This course provides a basis for her international course on computational methods targeting graduate students and postdoctoral students to help them understand the state-of-the-art computational methods used in the field.  Professor Kumar is also involved in K-12 science activities such as Super Science Saturday and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day initiatives. She develops ""Fun with molecules"", a series of presentations and hands-on learning modules for high school and middle school students that introduce underrepresented minority students to STEM careers. <br/><br/>This project focuses on chemical reactivity and dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. Graphene oxide (GO) is model surface system because it contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. This nano-scale heterogeneity leads to asymmetrical solvation environments, and a general condition where chemical adsorption and reactivity differ from one interfacial site to the next. The oxygen content of GO can be varied over a wide range, making GO a ""tunable"" material. This project uses computational molecular dynamics tools to explore the effect of oxygen content on interfacial structural and dynamical heterogeneity. Three specific themes that are critical for GO-based technologies are being explored, namely, the competition between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains on solvation environment and dynamics, reactivity at these interfaces, and structuring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The development of accurate yet efficient many-body, all atom force-fields as well as molecular interpretations of experimental data are key aspects of this project. Reactive force-fields based on the chemically intuitive empirical valence bond approach to model acid-base reactivity of GO membranes are also being developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Bier group is investigating whether measurement of the energy deposited when an ion impacts a detector can be related to the structure of the ion - information critical for understanding how molecules function.  This could enable, for example, improved chemical analysis of macromolecular complexes such as virus particles and synthetic nanoparticles.

The detectors are being combined with advanced high-speed electronics to improve arrival time and energy measurements, and tested on two mass spectrometers: a time-of-flight analyzer equipped with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and a high m/z ion trap equipped with both MALDI and electrospray ionization (ESI).   This should enable generation of mass spectra based on metastable fragmentation.  The research is exploring whether the energy response has additional analytical utility in the measurement of shape (e.g., of native proteins) and density (e.g., for gold nanoparticles).

His group is developing new catalysts that are capable of promoting selective chemical oxidation reactions. Oxidation reactions are essential synthetic tools because they increase the overall functionality of a molecule. Yet in spite of this importance, oxidation reactions that recognize different mirror images of molecules remain elusive. This is a problem because natural systems recognize specific mirror images of a molecule. Hence, the majority of new molecules forwarded as pharmaceuticals must be comprised of only one mirror image. Reactions that cannot operate in this context have limited utility. In this project, Professor Whitehead and his students are conducting oxidation reactions with activated iodine species. To do so in a manner that recognized the mirror images of a molecule, the activated iodine species are being urrounded by a peptide ligand that controls the three-dimensional environment around the reagent. Peptide ligands can be readily made with tremendous control of shape and functionality. Hence, their use provides an outstanding opportunity for discovery. In the effort being pursued, this synthetic work is combined with spectroscopy, X-Ray crystallography, and mechanistic studies in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that control selectivity in oxidation reactions. The project is contributing to the growing number of new methods for the synthesis of organic molecules with practical relevance to both the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry.  This project is well suited for the education of both undergraduate and graduate-level scientists.  Professor Whitehead's group is well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science by recruiting these individuals to participate in laboratory research related to the project.  Outreach activities involving K-6 Montessori students and grade-school aged homeschoolers are also being pursued as part of the funded project.  <br/><br/>Enantioselective catalytic transformations mediated by hypervalent iodine reagents are relatively rare, despite several key advances in the last 10 years.  These organocatalysts offer access to a wide variety of oxidative transformations of organic substrates while avoiding the use of expensive and toxic heavy-metal based catalysts.  This project is building upon significant preliminary data in order to develop a new class of peptide-based chiral hypervalent iodine catalysts in order to address two key goals: 1) to understand the structural drivers governing the observed enantioselectivity of initial ""hit"" peptide catalysts for the asymmetric alpha-oxytosylation of ketones and oxidative lactonization of keto-acids; and 2) to investigate novel iodo-arene containing amino acids in peptide scaffolds, optimize newly discovered catalysts, and expand the substrate/transformation scope of this new class of catalysts.

Dr. Gary Guillet of Georgia Southern University's Armstrong Campus investigates strategies to synthesize compounds containing three metal ions and two metal-metal bonds with the atoms and bonds arranged linearly. The study of metal-metal bonding is an area of intense research because of the unique properties of compounds that contain this type of bond. While there are many examples of compounds that contain two metal ions with a metal-metal bond between them, there is a dearth of compounds containing a larger number of metals with metal-metal bonding. Even more rare are compounds with metal-metal bonds that are linked in series. Dr. Guillet investigates the factors that affect the strength of the bonding, and the physical properties and reactivity of the compounds. This adds significantly to the understanding of metal-metal bonding within multi-metallic compounds and impacts fields such as molecular wire design. The student body of the Armstrong campus is diverse group and many students are minorities underrepresented in the chemical sciences. About 37% of the chemistry and biochemistry majors are first generation college students. In order to close the education gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, it is critical to expand access to research experiences for students. Institutional data clearly shows that students graduate faster if they participate in undergraduate research compared to their peers. With funding from this grant, Dr. Guillet is mentoring and promoting these students.<br/><br/>Dimetallic complexes of transition metals are abundant and thoroughly studied. However, extending these compounds by addition of a third metal forming linear, trimetallic, complexes is synthetically challenging and there is a dearth of these complexes. Most examples that exist of trimetallic complexes are supported using the ligand dipyridylamine. Novel trimetallic complexes are required to study the properties of these extended systems and new ligands are needed for this purpose. Dr. Guillet is investigating the synthesis of a novel ligand family designed to support trimetallic complexes of Fe, Co, and Ni. The physical properties of these complexes are being examined using multinuclear NMR, X-ray diffractometry, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy. Dr. Guillet is also investigating the reactivity using electrochemistry as well as synthetic redox reactions. Work on this project is expanding the understanding of ligand characteristics necessary to support trimetallic complexes and elucidate the characteristics of metal-metal communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Aaron Sadow from Iowa State University and colleagues Yan Zhao, Levi Stanley, Martin Thuo and Sarah Cady have acquired an upgrade for a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer by equipping it with a new console and a liquid-nitrogen, cooled cryoprobe as well as a flow NMR system to monitor kinetics. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists to study the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to understand the specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changes of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework as well as researchers and graduate students and high school students who participate in outreach activities. The NMR center also offers data collection and analysis for nearby industries.<br/><br/>This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It especially benefits the development of synthetic materials to produce bacterial biofilms and studies of catalytic reaction pathways. The spectrometer is also used in developing catalysts for new reactions that couple carbon-hydrogen and carbon-halogen bond activation with carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation and for engineering soft materials, one bond at a time."

The technique in development will allow him to obtain spectral signatures of individual molecules for identification purposes as well as the spatial location of these molecules. Moreover, his approach collects data at a much faster speed than what currently feasible, e.g positions of millions of single molecules in dense samples can be collected in minutes. The technique, once developed, will be a very powerful approach for the study of single molecules in a complex environment. For example, it can be used to study uneven distribution of molecules at nanometer scales or to monitor molecule-nanostructure interactions in real time, which cannot yet be achieved by existing techniques. This new measurement capability will find many applications in chemistry, biophysics, cell biology, and materials science. Professor Xu is also interested in integrating what he learns from research into his teaching. He is developing new courses on advanced microscopy and single-molecule spectroscopy for students who are interested. He is also passionate in mentoring students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, by serving as a Faculty Mentor to Regents' and Chancellor's (RC) and Cal Opportunity (CalOp) Scholars on campus. Professor Xu and his graduate students are teaming up with Bay Area Scientists in Schools (BASIS), a local volunteer program, to develop new science demos and teaching materials for local, underprivileged public schools.<br/><br/>Professor Xu is working to overcome the limitations of modern super high resolution optical imaging techniques by bringing together the spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions of single-molecule spectroscopy. Indeed, current approaches for the measurement of the fluorescence spectra of single molecules are limited by low throughput and spatial resolution. Meanwhile, emerging super-resolution microscopy methods offer outstanding spatial resolution but no spectral information. Through the development of a new scheme to spectrally disperse the fluorescence of single molecules in the wide-field and achieving molecular sparseness via photoswitching, Xu's approach enables concurrent spectral measurement and super-localization of single molecules with ultrahigh throughput (millions of molecules in a few minutes). Such spectrally-resolved super-resolution microscopy capabilities would offer spectral information for large amount of single molecules together with nanometer spatial resolution. It can therefore enable the interrogation of the behavior of single molecules in different chemical environments, modeling lipid bilayers and cell plasma membranes, and revealing, in a spectrally and spatially resolved fashion, the mechanisms of single-molecule fluorescence enhancement by plasmonic nanostructures."

For industrial applications, these synthesis methods must also be scalable and reproducible.  Microwave (MW) chemistry methods may achieve these performance demands.  Dr. Geoffrey Strouse is investigating microwave chemistry to develop new methods for the synthesis of magnetic alloys with very small dimensions (nanoparticles).  He is particularly interested in determining the effects of MW frequency, power, and optical properties on the rate of thermal decomposition of molecular clusters based upon the Prussian blue molecule.  Prussian blue molecules have are two different transition metals which, when decomposed by MW heating to form a metal alloy, create a nanoparticle with extremely strong magnetic properties.  These magnetic properties may be useful in many technological applications.  By judiciously choosing the MW variables, Dr. Strouse is able to control the composition and size of the nanoscale magnet, carefully tailoring its magnetic properties to the task at hand.  The research uncovers knowledge that is broadly useful in bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis and establishes new synthetic routes for nano-metal systems that are sustainable and can be scaled to industrial applications.  The MW methodology developed in this research impacts not only the fields of magnetism and magnet technology, but may offer routes to new catalysts as well.

These materials can absorb light and efficiently transport the energy or excitation (called excitons), making them attractive for solar energy conversion applications.  In addition, they support unique phenomena, such as the splitting of a single exciton into two lower-energy excitons, called singlet fission. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Chris Bardeen of the University of California, Riverside is combining novel sample preparation with time-resolved optical microscopy to study excitons in organic crystals.  The characterization of excitons in organic solids is challenging, since the fragile nature of the crystals makes it difficult to perform measurements.  Professor Bardeen and his students overcome this challenge by encapsulating these crystals beneath two-dimensional sheets of graphene or hexagonal boron nitride. These atomically thin layers form an optically transparent and chemically-resistant coating for the crystal. The encapsulated crystals are then studied using high-resolution microscopy techniques that can follow the excitons as they move through the crystal and undergo singlet fission . Insights from the work could advance our understanding of light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells. The project is also exploring implications for fields such as quantum computing. The project is providing the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research with advanced training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, microscopy, and data analysis, as well as supporting outreach efforts to Taft Elementary School. Ongoing projects include science demonstrations for various grades, science fair tutorials, a day-long visit to UCR by the fourth-grade, and classroom visits by undergraduate volunteers.

The first involves measuring the properties of the encapsulated crystal and its interaction with the environment using microscopy and photoluminescence methods.  Questions that can be addressed include whether the exciton behavior in molecular crystals heterogeneous on length-scales down to 20 nm and whether it is possible to transfer energy and charge across the atomically thin membranes.  The second category of experiments focuses on new space and time-resolved experiments to determine whether spin-entangled states of triplet pairs produced by singlet fission can extend over mesoscopic distances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This selectivity combined with the photochemical release of atomic oxygen allows the study of reactive intermediates that would otherwise be difficult to characterize.  In particular, the chemistry of sulfenic acids in physiologically relevant conditions will be investigated by utilizing photo-activatable atomic oxygen precursors and computational methods.

Biological molecules (biomolecules) like proteins and DNA can contain many atoms (thousands!). This means that their structures and internal motions (bending, twisting, folding) can be very complicated and hard to predict. In order to understand biomolecules, chemists have studied them in dilute solution, in other words, under conditions where they are interacting with surrounding water molecules, but not other large biomolecules. It has recently become evident that findings from these studies in dilute solution may not be representative of biological environments. In real living cells, biomolecules exist and function in crowded environments, often assembled together to form membranes, enzyme complexes, and organelles. What are the actual behaviors of biomolecules in real, crowded conditions? Professor Baiz and his students are using a technique called time-resolved, two-dimensional, infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) to study the structure and motions of molecules in more realistic, crowded environments. In order to help interpret the complicated 2D IR data, Professor Baiz is developing computer models for the crowded systems. Together, the experimental and computational studies are forming connections among molecular structure, environments, and dynamics to rationalize the mechanisms of protein interactions in the cell.  Through this project, Professor Baiz and his students are providing insights into how living systems function at the molecular level.  The research may also lead to new cryoprotectant technologies (cryoprotectants are chemical substances that hinder the formation of detrimental ice crystals in cells when they are frozen).

Structure-based infrared maps are used to generate spectra from molecular dynamics trajectories, and thus provide a direct connection between experiments and simulations. Vibrational probes, including thiocyanates, are used to access the solvation environments on the surface of proteins to understand the effect of protein polarity and electrostatics on local hydrogen-bond networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such reactions are central to many natural and industrial processes, including our own biochemistry.   Current simulation approaches that treat the solvent as a polarizable continuum have severe limitations.  Other, more sophisticated simulation approaches are able to predict rates but often do not give any insight into the underlying mechanisms of the reaction.   The ability to predict rates without mechanistic understanding seems like an advantage, but these analyses do not help researchers graduate from large scale computation to simple, accurate, and understandable models.  Simple theoretical models, such as those developed in this project; help scientists engineer processes involving complex reactions.  Moreover, simple models can both predict rates and interpret rate data from experiments.  The proposed work will have potential impact on chemistry, physics, biology, geology, materials science and engineering.  Peters and his research group develop software, documentation, and YouTube tutorials to help others perform these analyses with LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator; Sandia National Laboratories), CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics), and other widely used software packages.  <br/><br/><br/>The simple but accurate theories that have been developed for gas phase reactions, surface reactions, and electron transfer reactions share one common characteristic: they are built around a single reaction coordinate which accurately summarizes the mechanism.

The approach combines elements of continuum solvation approaches, variational transition state theory, energy gap coordinates from electron transfer theory, and a new polarization progress coordinate. The relative importance of these coordinates will be determined using transition path sampling and likelihood maximization approaches.  Instead of directly generating rates, this computational analysis guides the construction of simple rate theories that can be used to predict trends across entire reaction families.

Both Professor Long and the members of his group are active in disseminating their work to a broad scientific audience, and the graduate students in the group participate in programs which place them in local elementary and middle school classrooms for hands-on science lessons. <br/><br/>Single-molecule magnets are molecules with magnetically bistable ground states. When thermal energy is small relative to the thermal barrier between these states the magnetic molecule can retain its magnetization in the absence of an applied field. The proposed research adopts three strategies to synthesize single-molecule magnets which operate at higher temperatures. The first is to design systems with enhanced magnetic anisotropy, which will increase the thermal barrier to magnetic relaxation. Highly axial coordination environments will be employed for both transition metal and lanthanide complexes to achieve higher magnetic anisotropy. The second strategy is to utilize strong magnetic coupling to mitigate the effect of relaxation processes which shortcut the thermal barrier. Both transition metal and lanthanide complexes will be coupled with radical bridging ligands that promote strong metal-radical magnetic exchange. For transition metal complexes, direct metal-metal interactions will also lead to strongly coupled magnetic centers. Additionally, mixed 3d-4f systems will be developed to take advantage of both the large magnetic anisotropy of the lanthanides and the strong exchange coupling of the transition metals. Finally, the third strategy will place magnetically anisotropic moieties in the rigid coordination environments of metal-organic frameworks. In this manner it may be possible to minimize the effects of low energy lattice vibrations in causing through-barrier magnetic relaxation pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photocatalysts that make fuels, such as methane, using only carbon dioxide, water and sunlight would have significant benefit to society. However, developing photocatalysts capable of sunlight-to-fuel conversion is a challenging problem that requires a fundamental understanding of the chemical reactions taking place on the nanocrystal surface. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Sadtler at Washington University in St. Louis is developing microscopy methods to watch individual, light-driven reactions as they occur on single nanocrystal photocatalysts. Together, Professor Sadtler and his students are gaining new insights into why some atomic sites on the surface of nanocrystals are particularly active for catalysis. Professor Sadtler is also infusing his research into education. He is developing new courses that use atomic structure and chemical bonding as a basis to teach the frontiers of chemistry and materials science, as well as working with high school teachers and students in the St. Louis area.<br/><br/>Metal oxide semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable stoichiometry are promising photocatalysts to produce liquid fuels through solar water splitting, partial methane oxidation, and the reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the contribution of specific structural and morphological features among individual catalyst particles to their ensemble activity is not well understood because each particle is different and possesses a variety of potential reaction sites. This project uses super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and redox-active fluorogenic probes to monitor photoinduced charge-transfer events on individual metal oxide nanocrystals with nanoscale spatial resolution. Correlation of the reactivity maps with the atomic resolution of scanning transmission electron microscopy performed on the same particles reveals how the distribution of oxygen vacancies in individual particles affects their reactivity. To further develop structure-activity relationships in metal oxide photocatalysts, the single-molecule, single-particle data are compared to measurements of bulk photocatalytic activity for methane oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This microscope can be used to study, for example, how proteins bind to the membrane of a single cell. The microscope operates by shining a light source at a sensor chip or metal plate. The light interacts with the metal plate to excite electrons and modify the light which is reflected to a detector. This is the so-called surface plasmon signal. When a sample to be studied is added, the surface plasmon signal is changed and data such as the interaction of a protein with a cell membrane can be evaluated. This technique can also be used to study how nanomaterials interact with cancer cells. It can shed light on drug delivery systems. Other applications range from environmental science to food quality and safety. The instrument is used by undergraduates and graduate student in their research projects providing training in future careers in chemical and biological analysis. This is the first SPRM instrument in the Los Angeles area.  <br/><br/>The award of this surface plasmon resonance microscope is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids studies of protein binding kinetics studies at multiple and single cell membranes and the search for real-time interaction between antimicrobial effector molecules and bacterial surfaces. The microscope is essential for the exploration of medicine delivery on iron-containing metal-organic framework thin films and for engineering nanomaterials interaction and uptake in cells.

Findley at the University of Louisiana-Monroe to undertake complementary experimental and theoretical studies of the role of solvent structure in important chemical reactions.  Their work seeks improved understanding upon which to base better, more efficient, and less environmentally invasive chemical manufacturing and processing.  It is congruent with the aims of sustainable chemistry, including the principles that the use of solvents should be made unnecessary wherever possible, and solvents should be innocuous when used.   By involving graduate and undergraduate students from CUNY as well as undergraduates from Louisiana - Monroe (many of whom are from low-income families and are first generation college students), the work makes available exciting research opportunities intended not only to advance science, but to retain student interest and expand capabilities in STEM fields.  Some of the research utilizes synchrotron facilities at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, allowing all participating students to interact with scientists from a high caliber user facility, while introducing CUNY students to new aspects of United States culture in a Living/Learning community environment. The requirement that Monroe participants present their research results at Queens College ensures that these students will be exposed to a major urban environment -a first for many of these students.<br/><br/>The research specifically focuses on solvation of quasi-free electrons as probes of the solvent structure in the target media across the broad temperature and density range represented by these solvents.  The systems chosen for study include supercritical carbon dioxide, high temperature water, and supercritical water.  These solvents are targeted because their solvation properties can be adjusted by small changes in temperature and pressure, potentially enabling product isolation and solvent purification in a single step.  A free electron in solution makes an ideal probe of local solvent structure, and will help illuminate reactivity in these important media. Electrons with low energies are produced by field-enhanced photoemission from electrode surfaces in the solvent and the resulting current is detected with a second electrode.  Experiments are being conducted at a new synchrotron facility at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, and the resulting data are used to develop empirical models for the microscopic structure of the supercritical solvent systems."

Professor Flowers and his students are examining the mechanism for reactions of samarium (II) iodide (SmI2), a widely used reagent in organic synthesis.  The first goal of this project is designed to examine the role of proton donors (alcohols and water) on the reactivity and efficiency of reactions and determine whether electrons and protons are transferred in sequential steps, or whether the process is concerted and occurs through a formal hydrogen atom transfer.  The second goal of this project is to use the mechanistic information from studies on SmI2-proton donor systems to develop catalytic reactions. Students at the undergraduate and graduate level receive training in a range of scientific techniques.  Outreach to elementary students leads to sustained engagement with the local community.  Finally, video recordings of experimental protocols developed during these studies are freely disseminated on the Flowers research group webpage to assist scientists who use reagents based on SmI2.     <br/><br/>SmI2 is among the most widely employed reagents that reduce substrates and reactive intermediates through single electron transfer.  Although most reactions of SmI2 require proton donors, the mechanism of this reagent combination is not fully understood and the current view is that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a sequential electron-transfer, proton-transfer processes.  This work tests the hypothesis that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a formal hydrogen atom transfer and that the coupled transfer of an electron and proton is responsible for the unique reactivity of Sm(II)-coordinating proton donor reductions of substrates which are typically recalcitrant to reduction through single electron transfer.  As mechanistic work on Sm(II)-proton donors systems is performed, data obtained from these studies is used for the development of useful and user-friendly catalytic reactions; a longstanding, but elusive goal in this field.  Integration of a range of experimental techniques along with synthetic applications of proton-coupled, electron-transfer in synthesis provides a dynamic intellectual environment for students at all levels of study. The educational plan includes long-term engagement with local elementary schools designed to nurture greater interest in science.  Finally, as research is published in peer-reviewed journals, video recordings of all experimental protocols are made to aid scientists who want to repeat the reaction protocols."

Since silyl ketenes can yield three different polymer backbone chemistries as well as mixtures thereof, the challenge addressed in this work is formation of materials with specific structure and rigidity. The Lambrecht group develops computational approaches for predicting the contributions of ""synthons"" on reaction energetics and polymer properties from first principles; computational prediction informs synthesis performed in Pentzer's laboratory by proposing rational modifications, including solvent polarity and counterion choice.  The Pentzer group evaluates the impact of experimental conditions on polymerization, synthesizes and characterizes new polymers, and closes the feedback loop by generating empirical data to validate and refine computational approaches of Lambrecht. The research activities include 1) identifying the fundamental reactivity patterns of silyl ketenes as relevant to chain growth polymerization, 2) controlling the formation of well-defined oligomers, and 3) preparing each of the new polymer chemistries individually and establishing their properties and applications.

In addition to synthetic studies aimed at forming these complexes with a variety of ligands, a detailed mechanistic investigation is being carried out to determine the active species for proton binding and reduction, whether H-H formation occurs through a homolytic or heterolytic pathway, and the general factors that  control the mechanism of H2 evolution.

The loosely held electrons in these small particles, which can be pushed around by light, slosh around like waves in a pool. As the light intensity increases, these waves (called plasmons) become bigger, and with enough energy they can cause chemical reactions.  The particle's shape can also affect the size of the plasmon waves, with corners creating bigger waves than other parts of the particle.  As a result, particles with sharp features are desired. One strategy for creating these complicated structures is to use light to promote the growth. The problem is that the mechanism by which these sharp features form is not understood, and therefore difficult to control. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Wei David Wei at the University of Florida is exploring the light-driven growth of Ag nanostructures with prismatic shapes.  Insights gained from the project could lead to new materials, advancing technologies that range from cancer therapies to solar energy conversion.  The project is also providing training opportunities for the next generation of scientists, as well as educating high school students, teachers, and the general public on plasmonic nanomaterials.  Professor Wei also plans to develop radio modules in Spanish to bring general science to groups historically underrepresented in the scientific community in Florida.    <br/><br/>Working with his students, Professor Wei is exploring the role of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in driving the growth of Ag nanoprisms. The process starts with spherical Ag nanoparticles, which are then exposed to an intense light source.  The team then watches the particle grow using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and computer simulations aid in the interpretation of the experimental data.  Observations at the single-nanoparticle level provide a detailed view of the underlying photophysical and chemical processes regulating the plasmon-driven synthesis of the Ag nanoprisms.  The project is exploring the importance of a cooperative interplay between surfactants and metal SPR to effectively harness plasmon-driven photochemistry for nanomaterials synthesis. The molecular-level insights obtained in this project not only lay the groundwork for the design and construction of other types of shape-controlled plasmonic nanostructures, but more importantly, their implications benefit a broader field of plasmonic photochemistry beyond nanomaterials synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is to use computational techniques to investigate carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are small tubes with carbon connected together. Series of carbon-carbon bonds may spiral around the axis of the tube, and different spiraling rates indicate different types of CNTs. The tubes can be decorated with attachments of small organic molecules or polymers (functionalization), and the choices of which attachments and where can be customized so as to design, for example, what light comes out and how intense it is when an outside light shines on a CNT. Another goal being pursued is to use computations to optimize the molecular decoration for each type of CNT so that chemical processes may be used to separate sticky bundles of CNTs with different rates of spiral, which is the usual way CNTs are produced. Having them separated is ideal for carrying out experiments on CNTs, since experiments can then provide much more discriminating information. The computations for the decorated or functionalized CNTs use both quantum and classical mechanics to interpret and predict properties relevant to experiments.  This research aims to facilitate control over the processes of solar energy capture and conversion in functionalized CNTs at the fundamental level, and, thus, will be relevant to chemistry, materials science and engineering.<br/><br/>Functionalization of CNTs by small organic surfactants and conjugated polymers can improve chemical control of their optoelectronic and transport properties as well as offer promise in separation techniques for obtaining CNT samples with similar chiralities. The objective of this research is a systematic theoretical investigation of morphology, electronic structure, and excited state dynamics of CNTs functionalized by different types of conjugated oligomers and polymers. Using computational modeling, the investigators are working to understand fundamental physical processes occurring at organic-inorganic interfaces and governing the operation of CNT-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices such as exciton relaxation and recombination, charge transfer, and creation of several excitons from one absorbed photon (carrier multiplication). Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT (TDDFT) are being used for computing accurate electronic structure and optical response of polymer-CNT hybrids. Furthermore, quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics methods are being used to model phonon-mediated dynamics including charge and energy transfer in these systems. A novel approach to the calculation of quantum efficiency, the number of excitons generated by a photon, based on DFT augmented by the many body perturbation theory technique of quantum field theory is being applied to functionalized CNTs. Calculations of a variety of spectroscopic observables permit direct comparison and validation with ultrafast laser spectroscopic data (by other lasboratories) probing the fundamental electronic dynamics in functionalized CNTs. Just as importantly, these calculations provide explicit interpretations and predictions of the key phenomena occurring in the experimental measurements."

Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of cells because they generate chemical energy known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that sustains life.  These powerhouses function by harnessing the chemical potential of molecular oxygen to generate ATP through respiration.  Dysfunctions in human mitochondria are often associated with diseases.  As oxygen is broken down in mitochondria to produce ATP, reactive intermediates known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated.  The integrity of mitochondria is compromised when proteins, lipids or nucleic acids housed within the mitochondria react randomly with ROS.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to study the mechanism by which proteins damaged by reaction with ROS are removed from mitochondria by the ATP-dependent proteases known as Lon and ClpXP.  In this proposal, chemical agents will be developed to track the changes in Lon and ClpXP activities individually in mitochondria in order to understand the involvement of the two proteases in protecting mitochondria from ROS-induced protein damage.  Obtaining such information will enhance our understanding of the biology of mitochondria.  The students and a post-doctoral fellow participating in this project will be trained in a highly multidisciplinary environment.  They will also be trained to teach science and become more involved in the community by participating in an outreach program known as the National Youth Sports Program (NYSP).  NYSP is a summer program offered to children of low-income families in the greater Cleveland area between ages 10-16, designed to expose the children to a variety of sports and academic enrichment activities.<br/><br/>There is now a wealth of data in the literature to suggest that ATP-dependent proteolysis plays a crucial role in the turnover of oxidatively modified proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. The evaluation of Lon protease activity in isolated mammalian mitochondrial matrix has always been done in the presence of ClpXP using labeled casein as substrate, which is degraded by both proteases. Given that the two proteases exhibit overlapping specificity in the degradation of certain proteins, chemical reagents developed to specifically detect the physiological functions of the respective proteases during mitochondrial metabolism will provide insights into their contributions to the preservation of the integrity of the organelles.  In this proposal, experiments will be conducted to improve the selectivity, mitochondria-permeability and sensitivity of existing activity probes of Lon and ClpXP by modifying the sequences of the peptide substrates; and to develop fluorescently labeled peptidyl chloromethyl ketones, which are irreversible inhibitors of Lon and ClpXP, into activity-based probes to monitor the activation of the two proteases in cells."

Molecular recognition---the ability of molecules to recognize and bind specifically to other molecules---is a fundamental aspect of all physicochemical processes, and plays a central role in cellular interactions and biomolecular function.  Among the many examples in nature are the self-assembly of viruses in infected cells preparing to attack other cells; chemical signals directing embryos to form specific organs and limbs; and the mediation of thought and memory in the brain through chemical messenger exchange. In industrial settings, the principles of molecular recognition guide the development of new drugs, advanced materials, catalysts and chemical sensors.  However, quantitative models do not yet reach the level of atomic resolution and reliability necessary for designing molecules that target specific partners.  Molecules recognize other molecules based on static properties such as shape and charge.  However, they are also dynamical entities that perform recognition through the ability of binding partners to change shape and assume complementary conformations.  Dr. Gallicchio is developing advanced techniques and software to target these complex features and capture the influence of molecular motion and flexibility on molecular recognition processes.  The research is being carried out with active participation from Chemistry undergraduate students who, working with partnering experimental laboratories, interactively test computational predictions against measurements. The software and method development efforts involve Physics, Math, and Computer Science students. An important goal of the project is to help students from challenging socio-economic backgrounds to become the next generation of broad-thinking scientists, capable of tackling complex problems from multiple, convergent perspectives.  <br/><br/>The likelihood of interaction between two molecular species is related to the standard free energy of binding, or, equivalently, the equilibrium constant for bimolecular association.  The goal of this project is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to accurately and efficiently compute binding free energies from first principles, and to understand how free energies are influenced by molecular properties. A statistical analytic theory of binding relates physical quantities such as the geometry of the binding site, the size of the ligand, and the strength of their interactions, to dynamical data produced from binding free energy simulations.  This theory is being used to improve binding free energy methods through the use of massively-parallel non-equilibrium protocols, and to build an automated classification procedure for molecular complexes based on the parameters estimated from the statistical model.  The code developed for this project is being disseminated as high-performance, automated, freely available, and well-documented software, supporting a variety of platforms and operating systems, including computational grids and heterogeneous high-performance computing systems. The ability to treat dynamical aspects of binding has application to novel chemical synthesis, mitigation of chemical hazards, drug discovery, and materials design.  Research and educational activities are closely integrated within the project and are providing deserving students from challenging socio-economic backgrounds with the scientific and technological skills to enter the modern workforce, while planting the seeds for growing future generations of research scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nature of the interaction of the small metal particles with the oxide substrate, as well as the contact area between these two parts of the system, determines how selective and active the catalytic convertor is. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper and more detailed understanding of how contact between the metal particles and the oxide substrate affects the catalysis so that performance of these devices can be improved. In addition to the broader impact that this work is having on technology of use to society, the work is also positively affecting the educational experience of a number of undergraduate students involved in the research.

The goal is to develop stable catalysts with high redox activity at low temperatures. Particle shape and, especially, the type of crystalline faces exposed on the surface of crystalites are believed to play a major role in surface reducibility and catalytic activity of cerium-based oxide type redox catalysts. Preliminary data obtained in a pilot study have shown that CeO2 particles shaped as nanorods, nanotubes, or nanocubes with reactive {110}, {100}, {211}, etc., faces on the crystal surface can be produced using hydrothermal and microwave methods. In this project, the research team is preparing CeO2 supports with well-defined sizes and shapes, and investigating how these shapes and sizes affect model catalytic reactions, such as carbon monoxide oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction. The overall goal of this research is to develop a predictive model that naturally links different metals with various CeO2 surfaces for a superior low-temperature catalytic activity. Through the development of such a predictive model, the project has the potential to have a major impact on materials processing for many practical applications such as catalysis, fuel reaction and gas sensing, where the redox functionality of cerium-based oxides plays a crucial role."

There are three main thrusts in this project.  The first thrust aims to identify strategies and ec-LLS deposition parameters that effect desirable properties in Group IV (Ge, Si) macroscale crystals and micro/nanowires.  This knowledge is essential for the predictive control of the morphological, crystallographic, and electronic properties of crystalline covalent semiconductors prepared through ec-LLS method.

This network advances the science of rational design of chemicals and materials for reduced adverse biological activity. Utilizing empirical toxicity data, both in vivo and in vitro, computational models to describe molecular events that trigger toxic responses are being developed.  Through an iterative process of laboratory and computational studies, design guidelines (physical and chemical property parameters) are being created for molecules with minimal potential to cause oxidative stress through multiple toxicity pathways.  This strategy involves preparing model training sets based on chemicals relevant to toxicity associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS); using computational chemistry to model and predict chemical pathways that result in oxidative stress; modeling and measuring both in vivo and in vitro impacts of chemicals that generate ROS; and correlating in silico and experimental results to develop design parameters for minimal ROS activity.<br/><br/>Chemicals and the materials created through advanced chemistry are the basis of our society and our economy. Yet, with all of the excellent toxicology that has helped us understand and in some cases predict toxicity associated with industrial chemicals, little progress has been made in answering the fundamental scientific questions that would allow for the design of chemicals with reduced hazard to humans and the environment.  Although the vast majority of commercial chemicals are not intended to have biological activity, unintended toxicity is largely due to the lack of guidelines for coupling efficacy of function with design for reduced hazard. New guidelines and design tools aid in formulation of existing chemical products and guide innovation in safe alternatives. Acceptance and implementation of these tools are promoted by educational campaigns for students and professional chemists. Additional efforts seek to inform chemical policy by providing a means of managing classes of chemicals by common properties rather than on a case-by-case basis, with the overall goal to promote innovation through the use of rational chemical design to reduce or eliminate the toxic effects of new materials."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an offshoot of NMR, capitalizes on the same scientific principles study structures inside the human body, providing a critically important tool for diagnostic and cognitive (neurological) biomedical imaging.  A major drawback of both NMR and MRI is the need for large, immobile, and costly superconducting magnets and associated infrastructure.  With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Professors Alex Pines and Dmitry Budker and their groups at the University of California - Berkeley, seek to provide new methodology that enables magnetic resonance data to be obtained without the need for the huge magnets and with simple infrastructure, thereby producing information and images with equipment that is compact, mobile and less costly by a factor of 10-100.  The research offers significant impact on technical innovation from chemistry to biomedicine, while contributing to the training of an advanced workforce.<br/><br/>The purpose of the high magnetic field, Bo, in traditional NMR and MRI is twofold: a) to act as a means of polarizing the nuclear spins and b) for the efficient inductive detection of the magnetization precession. Each is proportional to the magnitude of the field so the total detected signal is proportional to the square of that field.  This accounts for the advantage of high fields (and their corresponding high frequencies) for spectroscopy and imaging.  Typical magnetic fields for current commercial NMR instrumentation range from 10-25 Tesla.  In order to dispense with the high field, alternative means of polarization and detection are required.  Polarization can be accomplished by optical pumping and/or parahydrogen-induced polarization.  Both methods produce ""hyperpolarization"" at zero to ultralow fields (ZULF) which is in fact several orders of magnitude greater than the thermal spin polarization at high field.  For detection, a non-inductive quantum detector is required.  Previous research utilized the high sensitivity of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) that operates at liquid helium temperature.  Professors Pines and Budker are now employing a laser atomic magnetometer that can also detect ultralow precession with high sensitivity but at room temperature.  To date, they have produced ZULF spectra with high signal/noise and with line widths of the order of 10mHz. In this project, they are expanding the methodology to include: 1) sophisticated ZULF pulse sequences for spin decoupling; 2) approaches to selective excitation of single transitions; 3) two-dimensional spectroscopy for atomic spin interactions; 4) separation of spin isotopomers; and 5) quantum correlations. The spectra and information emanating from this work may enhance the applicability of NMR spectroscopy in analytical chemistry and chemical biology."

He plans to design and build a microscope that can improve the imaging speed and can go to the deep infared region (1064 nm wavelength excitation), which would allow the detection of deeply embedded chemical species. Professor Chan's new instrument is expected to be useful in many areas, including forensics, pharmaceutics, archaeology, and agriculture, to name a few. Professor Chan also plans to work with his collaborator in University of Nevada, Reno, to apply this method to study the uptake of nanoparticles from the environment in plant tissue. The particular type of nanoparticles they are interested in, carbon nanotubes (CNT), are used in many commercial products and their inevitable release into the environment poses many potential environmental, food safety, and human health concerns. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of CNT uptake into plant materials is very important to mitigate this effect. The collaborative nature of this research effort provides participating students with unique experience at the interface of chemical measurement and environmental engineering.  It also promotes cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at UC Davis and University of Nevada, Reno. In synergy with the research, Professor Chan is developing an education and outreach program to include participation of local high school and college undergraduate students.<br/>  <br/>Improving imaging speed is a major challenge in the field of Raman microscopy. This project is focused on addressing this issue by developing a novel multifocal system designed to detect spectra from multiple regions within a specimen simultaneously. This multifocal design generates a 2-D array of laser spots that illuminate the sample, and the laser spots are rapidly turned on and off by scanning the laser beam using fast scan mirrors in defined patterns to acquire a series of superimposed spectral data that is then deconvoluted to retrieve the individual spectra from each laser focus with minimal spectral crosstalk. The goal of this project is to integrate this design into a 1064 nm Raman microscope equipped with an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodiode linear array and to demonstrate improved imaging speeds at fast read out rates. The imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio is characterized as a function of different sized laser focal array patterns and the optimal multifocal design is determined. This instrument is then used to image carbon nanotubes that have been uptaken into plant tissues using the characteristic G-band and D-band Raman signatures of CNTs. Uptake and retention times, as well as spatial distribution of the CNTs are to be determined and quantified based on the Raman images. The effect of microbial activity (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacteria) on CNT degradation and its impact on CNT plant uptake dynamics is to be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor O'Neil is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Western Washington University.  He is developing new reactions that allow access to one mirror image of a carbon atom over another. Many important molecules (e.g. medicinal natural products) and materials exist as a single mirror image with their activity directly related to that specific mirror image. Hence, methods to control which mirror image of a carbon atom is formed are essential for the construction of molecules that have the correct biological activity. Accordingly, Professor O-Neil and his group are harnessing the unique chemistry of samarium(II)-water complexes to achieve this goal. The reactions were chosen because samarium(II) is readily available, and the ability to perform the reactions in water obviates special handling or equipment requirements. Thus, the chemistry is readily adoptable by others, well suited for research at a primarily undergraduate institution, and compatible with incorporation into an Introductory Organic Laboratory course. In addition, student participants are learning a variety of research methods including organic synthesis and advanced analytical techniques. They become integrated into the scientific community through attendance at professional meetings and dissemination of results using both standard (e.g. scientific papers and posters) and less traditional outlets (e.g. podcasts, videos, magazine articles). Professor O'Neil's group is well positioned to provide this experience for students underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>The ability to generate stereogenic carbons with absolute stereocontrol is a requirement for many compelling synthetic targets. The goal of this project is to investigate the use of SmI2(H2O)n for allylic benzoate reductions. The combination leads a highly versatile and accessible method for the synthesis of asymmetric carbon atoms. The reactions are potentially powerful because they provide a solution to an existing challenge that does not require the use of specialized reagents, is easy to execute, and has a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. The methods are capable of generating asymmetric carbon atoms that can be difficult to construct with other methods, they consistently and predictably lead to stereoselectivities that are controllable by starting substrate structure and independent of the groups attached to the newly formed stereogenic carbon, they are straightforward to conduct using readily available reagents/substrates and with water (thereby allowing for functional groups (e.g. -OH) often not tolerated), and they are controlled by a stereo-differentiating group that can either be incorporated into the final target or be recycled as a chiral auxiliary. Broader impacts and educational components of the project include the development and implementation of a 4-day undergraduate laboratory experiment that teaches concepts related to stereochemistry and the methods needed for isomer ratio determination. This work will also create a repository with optical activity data for various chiral aldehydes available for use by other groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Supported noble metal catalysts play a central role in energy conversion, chemical transformations, and the improved quality of our environment. Noble metals are, however, usually very expensive. The efficient use of noble metals is a critical factor in developing and applying noble metal catalysts. The atom efficiency and specific activity (i.e., activity per atom) generally increases with decreasing particle size, with the ultimate limit of size reduction that of a single atom. Dr. Liu's approach is to anchor the single atom onto nanostructured supports to immobilize them and prevent them from clustering together.  The insights gained in this investigation are being used to guide the molecular design of next-generation catalysts for energy and environmental applications. The knowledge learned in this study promotes societal broader impact in fostering chemical sustainability by reducing the usage of limited and expensive raw materials and lowering the costs of goods.

In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using a combination of an experimental technique called sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and computational modeling called density functional theory (DFT) to investigate carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by a series of copper and copper/iron containing photo-electrocatalysts.  SFG vibrational spectroscopy is able to show how molecules important in CO2 reduction interact with the catalyst surfaces during the reaction.  DFT calculations are used to help explain the SFG data generated during the reaction.  The combination  of the two techniques leads to a complete picture of the surface reaction mechanism, allowing for better design of the catalyst and the photo-electrocatalysis process.  The ability to photo-electrochemically reduce CO2 using sunlight has the potential to enable us to recycle carbon and stabilize the environmental impacts of CO2 emissions from automobiles and other sources.

In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and complementary density functional theory (DFT) computational modeling to investigate CO2 activation and subsequent reduction on a series of CuO/CuFeO2 surfaces as a function of relative phase composition.  CuO/CuFeO2 catalysts with varying amounts of CuO and CuFeO2 show tunable selectivity between acetate and formate production.  The ability to probe the molecular intermediates associated with these reaction pathways, coupled with the ability to tune these relative rates, is providing a valuable case study for a thorough mechanistic investigation of the surface properties that mediate reaction kinetics leading to tunable selectivity for CO2 reduction.  Complementary measurements using femtosecond soft x-ray spectroscopy show electron thermalization kinetics and site-specific charge localization with element specificity.  Through information from the soft x-ray spectroscopy and DFT-derived band structure, the team obtains the reduction potential of site-localized photo-excited electrons in the oxide surface and compares these potentials to the calculated change in free energy of formation of elementary steps on these respective atomic sites.  This combination of approaches bridges the fields of semiconductor photo-physics with surface chemistry and catalysis in order to provide a fundamental framework for understanding the selectivity of CO2 photo-electrochemistry on metal oxides surfaces.

The Stollenz Group is exploring novel molecules that contain specific arrangements of individual metal atoms. The molecules are highly luminescent, and they have the potential to serve as molecular wires. Molecular wires have fascinated scientists for decades because they are an essential component of building miniaturized electron devices on the submicroscopic scale. Luminescent, multinuclear complexes of copper, silver, and gold are of particular interest in this regard, since they can also be applied in molecular/organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). To build molecular wires of this nature, synthetic methodologies are needed that can produce new molecules that contain specific arrangements of the individual metal atoms. With this in mind, Professor Stollenz and his group are working to develop new methodology for producing not only strictly linear arrays of copper, silver, and gold ions, but also arrangements that are substantially bent for use in conducting molecular coils. A long-term prospect for such molecular coils, embedded in electronic circuits, is to utilize them as tiny electromagnets that can be integrated in nanomachines and other nanoscaled electronic devices. Such devices can in turn be applied in nanorobots that deliver drugs inside a human body. If these devices are luminescent, their path can be followed by fluorescence imaging. The Broader Impacts of the work also includes the mentoring and training of undergraduate and master students from the significant population of underrepresented groups at Kennesaw State University.<br/><br/>This research program focuses on the development and implementation of new strategies to multinuclear coinage metal arrays that both serve as potentially conducting molecular coils and as molecular/organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The underlying synthetic methods give a fundamental approach to control aggregation of linear cluster assemblies and provide a deep insight into the coordination chemistry of multinuclear complex arrays in general. Specifically, a library of new bis(amidine) ligands that are capable of accommodating at least four copper or silver centers, arranged in a linear fashion, is being created. The incorporation of Cu(I) ions in the arrays is accomplished by employing a clean organometallic Cu(I) source, mesitylcopper. The resulting linear cluster assemblies can either be homoleptic complexes or complexes that retain the mesityl groups. Bis(amidine) ligands with additional terminal N-donor groups are selectively protected by AuCl complex fragments. These heretofore unknown digold-metalloligands are utilized as building blocks for new linear or bundled homonuclear gold or heterobimetallic gold/copper cluster assemblies as promising luminescent materials. Finally, new bis(amidinato)lithium complexes are synthesized and their behavior in solution is investigated. Furthermore, this program provides an in-depth training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in synthesis, characterization techniques (crystallography and spectroscopy), oral presentation skills, scientific writing, laboratory safety, and data management. These measures prepare students to achieve their ambitious career goals in science or industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because tRNAs are involved in the fundamental process of protein translation, it is important that new tools and approaches be developed that enable the sensitive and accurate determination of tRNA population and extent of modifications to the original tRNA sequence. This research will significantly advance the field of tRNA characterization by establishing the techniques required for multiplexed characterizations of tRNA populations. The advantage of multiplexed characterization is that significantly more information on tRNA identity and sequence modification can be obtained in a shorter time period and from less sample, as compared to current methods that analyze one tRNA at a time. This research project is multidisciplinary, involving the areas of chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, thus undergraduates and graduate students working on this project will gain key instruction and insights into the field of modern biological mass spectrometry. These activities continue a long-standing emphasis of Professor Limbach on expanding the number of engaged underrepresented minorities in science, in general, and mass spectrometry, in particular.<br/><br/>During the award period, Professor Limbach and his group will develop two enzymatic approaches for tagging RNase digestion products with mass unique labels, which allow sample identity to be differentiated. These labeling strategies will overcome the limitations of existing 16O/18O-labeling approaches, are directly compatible with automated data analysis, and offer flexibility in sample purification or other sample manipulation steps. The labeling strategies include T4 RNA ligase, which will use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as the tag, and polyadenylate polymerase, which will use unmodified and modified dideoxynucleoside triphosphates as the tag. For each labeling approach, up to a four-plex comparative analysis assay is possible, which will enable information-rich investigations into a variety of biological processes. This new enzymatic labeling strategy for multiplexing our comparative analysis assay will be ideal for moving tRNA modification pattern analysis from bacteria into archaea and eukaryotes, including mammals. Because tRNA modification is known to be important in tRNA structure and function, these advances will provide researchers with a routine method for examining biological effects of hyper- and hypomodified tRNAs."

Specifically, the new laser tools involve light at terahertz (THz) frequencies (this frequency range lies between the infrared and microwave parts of the light spectrum).  These THz lasers are also designed to produce extremely short pulses of light (a few femtoseconds, where a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of one second).  The femtosecond THz laser pulses are then used to probe the motions of the liquid molecules as they interact with other reactive molecules dissolved in the liquid. The THz pulses also make it possible to control the orientation of the molecules in the liquid, and to examine how energy flows between two reacting molecules or between the molecules and the liquid. Professors Blake and Miller combine the experimental data with computer simulations of liquids and clusters of molecules to build better models for understanding chemical reactions in liquids. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from an increased understanding of how liquids solvate molecules and influence chemical reactivity, as well as opportunities for the training of graduate students and undergraduates in the design and construction of advanced experimental instrumentation and complex computer simulation.  The Blake and Miller research groups also engage the local K-12 community, for example via the Caltech Pre-College Science Initiative (CAPSI) program (Prof. Blake) and Prof. Miller's Team Research yielding Integrated Educational Tools (TRIDENT) program.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the nonlinear THz spectroscopy of neat liquids and mixtures at various temperatures. Detailed molecular pictures of the structure and dynamics of liquids drive our understanding of chemistry and biology. Nonlinear two dimensional (2D)-infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies have revealed many specifics of liquid behavior. Extending such tools into the THz regime would directly probe liquid dynamics supported by intermolecular forces. This research project does so by combining two intense THz pulses whose arrival at the sample can be swept over controlled delays, with the subsequent anisotropy and Raman spectrum of the liquid probed by a third pulse at 800 nm.  By mapping out the liquid response over the relative delays between the three pulses, a 2D-THz-THz-Raman (2D-TTR) spectrum is obtained. This method inherently suppresses the linear response of the system, and so is sensitive to anharmonicities in the intermolecular liquid potential energy surface and the electric dipole moment and Raman polarizability surfaces.  To determine the origins of the observed response, the experimental observations are interpreted with theoretical calculations both of molecular clusters and liquid models. The cluster work involves high accuracy electronic structure calculations, while the liquid simulations are based on molecular dynamics approaches."

The many applications of these interactions continue to revolutionize society through advances in medicine, communications, technology, and entertainment. Controlling the fundamental way in which matter interacts with light represents a major priority for many phenomena of great importance for society. This grand challenge is yet to be fully conquered despite the efforts of many chemists and physicists. With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Carlos E. Crespo-Hernndez of Case Western Reserve University to investigate whether strategic structural modification of the DNA component pyrimidine can be used to rationally control the dissipation of energy, processes critical to DNA photochemistry and photostability. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez and his research students use a combination of experiment and theory to examine this innovative idea. The transformative potential of this research is the development of molecular design principles for the control of light-induced pathways in biological and other organic molecules in general. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez seeks to motivate students to enter and persist in scientific studies and careers by providing research opportunities to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and by mentoring and serving as a role model. The interests of these students are heightened by opportunities for cross- and multidisciplinary research and training in important areas of modern photochemistry and photobiology, time-resolved techniques, and computational methods, and by exposure to national and international collaborations. Research opportunities are provided for economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students from the Greater Cleveland area.<br/><br/>In this research, Professor Crespo-Hernndez is investigating whether selective functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore can be used to rationally control the radiative and nonradiative decay pathways that are critical to nucleic acid photochemistry. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez and his research students examine this innovative idea by gathering experimental and theoretical data using femto-to-microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy and multiconfigurational calculations.  The objectives include: 1) unravel the electronic relaxation pathways in rationally selected nucleic acid derivatives; 2) map the topology of the potential energy surfaces; and 3) establish structure-dynamics relationships to reveal how functionalization regulates radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. Close collaboration with the theoretical group of Professor Ins Corral of the Universidad Autnoma de Madrid, Spain enhance the impact and increase fundamental understanding of the transformative science proposed. Understanding how functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore regulates the electronic relaxation pathways in nucleic acid derivatives can assist in the development of therapeutic drugs, crosslinking agents, and fluorescent biomarkers, and may hold the key for understanding why the genetic alphabet is composed of only four nucleobases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many applications of QIS, a ""quantum memory"" that can store and recall quantum states on demand is an urgently needed enabling component. This project pursues a new approach by introducing controlled chemical disorder into high-quality crystals to inhibit the ""decoherence"" processes that corrupt stored quantum information and limit the performance of existing memories.   This international collaboration funded by the Division of Chemistry through the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B program and the French ANR, combines teams with expertise in diverse areas ranging from solid-state chemistry and quantum physics to non-linear optics and information theory to solve this outstanding problem.  Advancing the capabilities of quantum memory technology is of strategic importance given the broad need in our society to transmit information in a way that is and remains absolutely secure.  In addition, the materials developed in this project have applications in many other photonic technologies including classical optical signal processing, ultra-stable optical clocks, and solid-state lasers.<br/><br/>This collaboration addresses a critical need for new photonic materials with low quantum decoherence by introducing specific types of chemical disorder in crystals. Of all the optically addressed quantum memories being investigated, rare-earth ions in crystals at cryogenic temperatures stand out as one of the most promising light-matter interfaces that can store and recall the quantum states of light with high fidelity, efficiency, and bandwidth. This project investigates how incorporation of substitutional chemical dopants, introduction of defects such as oxygen vacancies, and weak local perturbations of chemical bonds due to compositionally induced lattice strain can disrupt the ion-ion, spin-ion, and photon-ion interaction mechanisms responsible for decoherence dynamics that limit the performance of quantum memories. This new material chemistry solution for developing low-decoherence materials coordinates fundamental studies of material properties and chemistry, design and synthesis of materials, and practical tests of performance in quantum memory demonstrations to develop a telecommunications-compatible system for efficient teleportation of quantum states between light and matter in quantum communication and computing systems."

The chemical composition of a polymer dictates its properties including strength, flexibility, recyclability, etc., which define applications.  In this research project, Prof. Pentzer at Case Western Reserve University and Prof. Lambrecht at University of Pittsburgh explore the use of ketenes, a class of under-utilized monomers, for preparing novel polymers with high mechanical strength, and yet high solubility for facile processing.  Computational prediction is integrated with synthesis and characterization to enable cost- and time-efficient discovery of such new polymers.  This multidisciplinary project provides research training to undergraduate and graduate students, preparing the future generation of skilled workforce in science and engineering fields. <br/><br/>The research team studies the chain growth polymerization of silyl ketenes, (R3Si(H)C=C=O), which form solution processable polymers with variable backbone and side groups that behave as rigid rod polymers (RRPs). Since silyl ketenes can yield three different polymer backbone chemistries as well as mixtures thereof, the challenge addressed in this work is formation of materials with specific structure and rigidity. The Lambrecht group develops computational approaches for predicting the contributions of ""synthons"" on reaction energetics and polymer properties from first principles; computational prediction informs synthesis performed in Pentzer's laboratory by proposing rational modifications, including solvent polarity and counterion choice.  The Pentzer group evaluates the impact of experimental conditions on polymerization, synthesizes and characterizes new polymers, and closes the feedback loop by generating empirical data to validate and refine computational approaches of Lambrecht. The research activities include 1) identifying the fundamental reactivity patterns of silyl ketenes as relevant to chain growth polymerization, 2) controlling the formation of well-defined oligomers, and 3) preparing each of the new polymer chemistries individually and establishing their properties and applications.

Differences in the relative abundances of cholesterol among the membranes of various organelles influence mammalian cell function and are correlated with disease.

This is to say two molecules can have the same number and kinds of atoms and geometric arrangement, but they are mirror images of each other, as are one's left and right hands.  This ""handedness"" in chemistry is referred to as ""chirality."" In chemical measurements, distinguishing between the ""hands""- known as enantiomers- and quantifying the amounts of each can be a difficult technological challenge.  This difficulty can limit our ability to synthesize and separate a given enantiomer. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism (CSDM-A) and Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Programs of the Chemistry Division, Professor Garry Grubbs II of the Missouri University of Science and Technology is using advanced microwave spectroscopy techniques to determine the type and concentration of enantiomers present in a sample. Microwave spectroscopy provides information about molecular structure based on how fast they can be made to rotate by the microwave radiation.  Professor Grubbs hypothesizes that ""handedness"" of a molecule can be determined if that molecule contains a very heavy atom like bromine or iodine.  The nuclei of these heavy atoms contain arrangements of electrical charge that can make the rotations of the overall molecule reveal more about its structure in a microwave experiment than it would otherwise.  If Professor Grubbs' hypothesis is correct, there may be new paths toward faster and more accurate synthesis and monitoring of chiral systems, which is particularly important to pharmaceutical research. The project is also training graduate students in currently unexplored areas of physical chemistry using state-of-the-art instrument design as well as new quantum theory development.<br/><br/>This project focuses on utilizing the recent discovery of microwave three-wave mixing in chiral systems on nuclear electric quadrupole coupling interactions. These experiments are designed to establish, for the first time, experimental data and theoretical understanding for nuclear spin-based methodologies for identifying and quantifying enantiomeric species in mixtures. Microwave three-wave mixing involves utilizing rotational transitions involving excitation along two molecular axes while detecting along the third axis, creating closed-loop transition energy pathways very similar to a three-level maser system. Electric dipole-forbidden, quadrupole-facilitated transitions occur when off-diagonal nuclear electric quadrupole interactions are on the order of the molecular rotation constants and follow the same closed-loop pathway. These are then leveraged using microwave three-wave mixing because of the technique's sensitivity to phase rather than energy of traditional microwave spectroscopy, allowing for the determination of the off-diagonal sign in a singular experiment for the first time as well as insight into the enantiomer in question. Isotopic substitution spectra analysis are then used to validate the veracity of the experimental results.  In addition to the technological and educational impacts, this research may expand the reach of, and molecular information offered from, microwave spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems - one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation's energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  The project supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Professor Robert J. McMahon has been a major contributor in developing the Department's Plan for Broadening Participation and participated in the National Diversity Equity Workshop series.  Professor Robert J. McMahon is also a champion of STEM education on the UW-Madison campus.  <br/><br/>This proposal addresses issues in mechanistic organic chemistry that are relevant to our understanding of harsh reaction environments.

However, there is a lack of understanding about functional mechanisms for proteins, especially for enzymes. This prevents deeper understanding of protein evolution. To meet this challenge, Professor Tao and his research group are developing an advanced theoretical framework and computational techniques to connect the evolution of enzyme sequences and structure to the evolution of their functions, catalytic activity, and mechanisms. They focus on beta-lactamases as enzymes that hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics and serve as one main cause of antimicrobial resistance. This work will provide fundamental understanding about the evolution of beta-lactamases' catalytic mechanisms, and could help develop a new generation of antibiotics with low resistance. The award also supports the development of educational materials to boost basic science education and outreach on social media. These freely accessible materials will benefit and shape the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers from economically disadvantaged student populations.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing a theoretical framework to describe enzymatic mechanism landscapes, which are defined as the structural analysis of aligned reaction pathways of evolutionarily related enzymes using statistical and machine-learning methods. This theoretical framework is helping to predict how new mutations in enzymes could lead to changes in catalytic mechanisms and activities. New computational methods are being developed by Professor Tao and his research group to explore enzyme structure-function relations and provide the missing connection between the evolution of protein structure and the variations in enzyme mechanism that are less amenable to experiment. They are also developing online-based chemistry education channels and outreach platforms to enhance general chemistry education through collaboration with teachers from other schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prof. Brooks and her students study the role of secondary organic aerosols SAO) in the nucleation of atmospheric ice particles. Recent measurements indicate that several current assumptions about the organic aerosol phase and the cloud-forming properties may be incorrect. First, the majority of SOA in the troposphere exist in a viscous, rather free-flowing liquid state. Second, the presence of viscous organic aerosols represents a previously unrecognized supply of particles capable of causing the freezing of ice crystals in clouds.  The data collected are used to assess the role of viscous phases and retarded water diffusion in atmospheric ice nucleation processes. The project also includes the training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students. During summers at Texas A&M, high school students attend the campus-wide TAMU Youth Adventure Program to participate in lecture and laboratory activities including, ""The role of viscosity in the foods we love."" <br/> The team collects quantitative data on the phase, water diffusion, and ice nucleating ability of representative organic compounds and mixtures. The phases of sample aerosols are characterized by their temperature-dependent viscosities and the temperature at which they transition from liquid to glass using specialized spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the freezing temperatures of all samples are determined using our custom ice microscope technique. Taken together the data are used to evaluate whether a minimum glass transition temperature requirement exists for viscous aerosol to facilitate the freezing of droplets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In high school and college chemistry classes, chemical bonds are typically presented as pairs of electrons shared between two atoms (a single pair produces a single bond, two pairs create a double bond, etc.).  However, there are many cases where chemical bonds are formed through electrons being shared by multiple atoms (hence the name ""multicenter"").  Professor Boldyrev and his group have developed a theoretical model that takes into account both two- and multi-center chemical bonding.  He and his group are now applying this model to explain the geometry and behavior of complex systems such as cluster molecules containing dozens of atoms, molecules dissolved in liquids, and molecules which have been excited by light.  Chemical bonding is at the heart of chemical understanding, and is the basis for explaining why molecules and solids adopt a certain geometric structure, and why molecules or solids react with other molecules in a particular manner.  Professor Boldyrev's computational approach is called Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning, or ""AdNDP.""  AdNDP is currently used by 50 research groups around the world, and the Boldyrev group is continuing to make this program and its updates available to other scientists.  The graduate students involved in this project are not only helping to advance the field of chemistry, but are also obtaining important skills in computer programming and software development, all of which are valuable assets in the technology industry.<br/><br/><br/>This project is exploring new chemistry frontiers for the application of the AdNDP method and its solid-state adaptation (SSAdNDP).   The topics being studied include chemical bonding in excited states of molecules and clusters, the interaction of solvated electrons and multiply charged anions with solvent molecules.  The project seeks to understand the chemical bonding in novel three-dimensional (3D) chemical systems that have been synthesized under extremely high pressure. Such high-pressure compounds violate many conventional stoichiometries and chemical bonding.  In such systems, chemical bonding cannot be rationalized on the basis of a Lewis model alone. This project continues to benefit from collaborations with experimentalists (Professors Kit Bowen at Johns Hopkins, Lai-Sheng Wang at Brown University, Michael Heaven at Emory University, and Zhong-Ming Sun at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) who are providing experimental data on newly  made clusters (0D species), as well as new 1D-, 2D- and 3D-materials. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits of the AdNDP and SSAdNDP methods for the rational design of new materials, and for application in chemical education. These methods and the software developed under the support of Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) Program of the NSF Chemistry Division are being developed for use in classes such as general chemistry, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, advanced inorganic chemistry, nanotechnology, and materials chemistry."

Siloxanes are high-production compounds manufactured for a variety of uses, including as components of adhesives, coatings, and personal care products. The siloxanes can be detected in environmental samples worldwide including in remote Arctic regions. Due to the environmental persistence of these compounds and concerns over their toxicity to aquatic organisms, the environmental chemistry of siloxanes is an emerging area of interest. In the environment, siloxanes preferentially partition to the atmosphere where they undergo chemical reactions to form new products. These products may have a different fate than the original compound. This project improves the understanding of the timescale and products of the atmospheric degradation of siloxanes and provides the data necessary to evaluate their environmental fate.

Results are incorporated into undergraduate educational materials.<br/>  <br/>This project uses laboratory experiments to investigate the multigenerational atmospheric chemistry of siloxanes. The reaction rates of common linear and cyclic siloxanes with the hydroxyl radical and chlorine atom are measured to understand the lifetime of the compounds.

Their detection and quantification is difficult because of their reactivity. Often only a total of organic peroxy radicals are measured, or only early decomposition products are identified. This project involves novel laboratory studies of the reactivity of these species which provides more detailed information than previously possible.

Current imaging techniques, however, present several challenges. On the one hand, many techniques require several hours to tens of hours to obtain a surface element map with high resolution. On the other hand, current higher sample throughput techniques may not be widely accessible.  Some high throughput techniques require the use of synchrotron radiation facilities which are relatively rare.

As such, imaging protocols currently  limited by analysis time restrictions may become routine diagnostic tools. This research impacts many scientific research fields, from materials to biological sciences. The project also offers training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate researchers with regard to instrument development, fundamental studies, and application development in plasma-based optical hyperspectral imaging and surface analysis.

The goal of this project is to study how sunlight determines the fate of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) in surface water of lakes and oceans. These compounds have been classified as persistent organic pollutants, but there are insufficient scientific data to assess their fate in the aqueous phase. Specifically, there are knowledge gaps about a process called indirect photolysis of SCCPs. In this project, this process is studied in the laboratory under environmentally relevant conditions. The degradation of SCCPs is mediated by two primary species responsible for indirect photolysis: the so-called hydrated electron and the hydroxyl radical. The mechanisms and rates of these reactions are being determined. There are indications that the pathway mediated by hydrated electrons is highly effective for degrading hydrophobic pollutants, especially in surface water. In such systems, the presence of dissolved organic matter is expected to facilitate the transformation reaction. The anticipated outcome of this research is a better understanding of the loss and persistence of an important class of pollutants in lakes and oceans. Undergraduate students from Colby college participate in this research both in the summer and during the academic year. They gain intense hands-on research experience in laboratory environmental chemistry. A postdoctoral researcher learns about the intersection of photochemistry, high-end analytical techniques, and computational chemistry. <br/><br/>This project investigates whether hydrated electrons are the active species for the photolysis of SCCPs in surface water. It is hypothesized that this photochemical degradation with hydrated electrons occurs in dissolved organic matter (DOM) aggregates. Irradiation experiments are conducted using DOM-containing systems as well as clean systems that allow a separate investigation of the SCCP photolysis by hydrated electrons as well as by hydroxyl radicals. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is used to quantify degradation of the highly complex mixture of SCCP congeners. To interpret results from the DOM-containing photolysis experiments, the affinity of individual SCCP congeners into the DOM phase is being estimated using quantum chemical-based computational chemistry tools. Overall, this project advances the understanding of the photochemical fate of hydrophobic pollutants in surface waters. The project also improves the fundamental knowledge of a so-far understudied photoreactive species, the hydrated electron. Furthermore, this project trains the next generation of researchers and includes a significant undergraduate education component.

These probes are genetically incorporated into the peptide backbone and are minimally perturbing to protein folding.  The project builds upon the principal investigator's discovery that thioamide substitutions of the peptide backbone can serve as small fluorescence quenchers.  In this case, equally minimalist sidechain thioamide probes are generated and genetically encoded.  Photophysical studies of the fluorescent amino acids and/or thioamide quenchers are used to pair them in appropriate sets. The pairs are used to probe conformational changes over all relevant distance ranges in proteins.  These minimalist tools are particularly valuable in co-translational protein folding studies or labeling the interior of a folded protein. Such experiments are currently inaccessible to common post-translational fluorescent labeling strategies.  The project is also creating computational tools to identify non-perturbing sites for label incorporation.  A strategy for incorporating fluorescence data as conformational constraints in models of protein motion is being developed.  The computational tools are implemented in the popular, open-source platform Rosetta, so that they can be accessed and modified by the protein research community."

Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts and her group at the University of California-Irvine (UCI) study the environmental fate of neonicotinoid pesticides. There has been a significant, recent, worldwide decline in bees, which play a major role in pollination. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated in this decline, along with other factors such as parasites and pathogens, loss of habitat and diversity of pollinators. Neonicotinoid pesticides have low toxicity to mammals.  However, in the atmosphere they may undergo transformations to form new products that are more toxic than the parent compounds.  The goals of this project are to elucidate the atmospheric reactions of neonicotinoids, the rate at which they are changed into other molecules in the environment, and the nature of the resultant molecules.  The results of this research will contribute to a molecular level understanding of the atmospheric lifetimes and fates of neonicotinoid pesticides in the environment.  The data collected enable scientists to establish the risk assessments for these compounds. Training in current techniques for studying heterogenous chemistry on surfaces is provided to a diverse group of students and postdoctoral fellows.  <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this research is to provide a molecular level understanding of the photochemistry of surface-bound neonicotinoid insecticides (NNs) and their reactions with trace atmospheric gaseous oxidants. NNs have found increasing use since their first introduction about 25 years ago, largely as seed coatings and soil treatments.  Their reactions once in the atmosphere are not well known.  This project studies the photochemistry and atmospheric reactions of seven commonly used neonicotinoids which are nitroguanidines (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and dinotefuran), cyanamidines (thiacloprid and acetamiprid) or nitromethylenes (nitenpyram).  The quantum yields for photolysis of the compounds that absorb light at wavelengths relevant to the atmosphere are measured. Also, both the gas phase and solid state products are determined using a variety of techniques. These techniques include attenuated total reflectance and transmission Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and several mass spectrometry techniques. The identity and yields of the products and the kinetics of oxidation by ozone, the hydroxyl radical and the nitrate radical are measured. This is used for a quantitative assessment of the atmospheric lifetimes and fates of neonicotinoids in air.Professor Finlayson-Pitts' is the Co-Director of AirUCI, a collaborative group of faculty at UCI that sponsors a number of educational initiatives, including student research retreats, training in effective communication and discussions of career options.

Professors Daniel Esposito and John Wright of Columbia University are developing new approaches to scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) that will enable high resolution chemical imaging over large areas. SECM is a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technique that has become invaluable for studying chemical processes across the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. Despite the success of SECM, it is not well suited for high resolution imaging over large areas. This limitation arises because conventional electrochemical probes are scanned in a sequential, point-by-point manner across the area of interest, meaning that high resolution imaging over large areas takes prohibitively long times to complete. The current project aims to break these tradeoffs and enable efficient, high-resolution imaging of large samples by using a combination of new sensing strategies and advanced signal reconstruction methodologies. This approach will greatly reduce imaging times and thereby expand the utility of SECM for many applications. The research plans are tightly integrated with educational and outreach activities.<br/><br/>SECM has become an invaluable tool in many fields of study. However, a major shortcoming of SECM, shared by many SPM techniques, is the trade-off between spatial resolution and areal scan rates. SECM imaging is commonly performed with nanoscale resolution, but such high resolution imaging is typically limited to very small areas (typically << square millimeters). The slow areal scan rates of conventional SECM arise from the fact that the scanning ?point probes?, or ultramicroelectrodes, must be scanned across every (X,Y) location within in an area of interest in a sequential, one-at-a-time manner. This project aims to develop a new approach to SECM imaging that combines i.) non-local continuous line probes (CLPs) and ii.) advanced compressed sensing (CS) signal analysis techniques. While the CLP geometry enables SECM signal to be rapidly measured over large areas, CS serves the critical role of constructing images from the convoluted SECM signal generated by the CLP. The project is organized around three primary objectives: i.) demonstrating the core benefits of combining CLP-SECM with CS, ii.) establishing the theoretical and practical limits of this new approach, and iii.) achieving chemical imaging with nanoscale resolution over macroscopic areas. Research and education are tightly integrated within this interdisciplinary research project, with a strong emphasis on educational activities and workforce training that targets the emerging industries in nanotechnology and signal processing / data analytics."

Sheppard of the University of Arizona is establishing techniques to measure the levels of nitrogen present in tree rings (dendronitrogen). The quantity of dendronitrogen correlates with nitrogen availability to the ecosystem and therefore permits the long term profiling of nutrient availability. Professor Shepard is studying ways to overcome two challenges to understanding the mobility of nitrogen between tree rings. First, some nitrogen-containing species are mobile across plant tissues that include tree rings, so the ratio of mobile to immobile species needs to be determined. Second, nitrogen is difficult to measure accurately and precisely in whole wood samples. These difficulties have historically cast uncertainty on the accuracy of dendronitrogen data and correlating the temporal variation in dendronitrogen to the environmental availability of nitrogen. Professor Shepard is working to establish a wood pretreatment strategy that will permit measurements that reflect availability of nitrogen at the time of ring formation and to develop protocols for accurately measuring nitrogen content in wood samples. <br/><br/>There is a measurable component of nitrogen in tree rings that is immobile in the form of proteins within cell walls.  That immobile component can reflect environmental nitrogen availability at the time of ring formation. Wood can be pretreated to effectively remove mobile nitrogen while preserving the immobile component. This is achieved in two steps. First, the tree cores are sliced into thin sections in the tangential orientation using a rotary microtome, a novel approach. Second, these slices are then treated with a mild combination of organic solvents in a sonication bath, to remove mobile nitrogen, while allowing the tracheid cells to remain intact and undamaged. This is key to preserving the structural, immobile nitrogen contained in the cell walls. Combustion elemental analysis and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, specifically optimized for nitrogen, are used to quantitatively assess the amount of dendronitrogen as a function of time. This research directly impacts our understanding of forest and ecosystem health and dynamics, and improves our general awareness about impacts of human society on ecosystem health."

Raman microscopy is a principal characterization technique for both surfaces and bulk samples. Using a laser, the microscope scans a sample which produces vibrational spectroscopic data providing chemical information about the material. An atomic force microscope (AFM) also scans a sample using a small probe or tip to provide information about the surface such as topography, hardness, electrical and thermal properties. Combining the two techniques in an AFM-Raman microscope provides both types of information from the same regions of the sample. It has wide application in research endeavors across the pure and applied sciences and engineering.  An important application is use in the investigation of converting methane to chemicals such as methanol using a catalyst on a surface. The microscope will enable study of the reaction of surface species as a function of reaction conditions to optimize the yield of valuable products. The acquisition will impact 5 colleges, 13 departments at the University of Delaware (UD) and users at Delaware State University (DSU, an HBCU) and the Winterthur Museum.

Fernando Rosario-Ortiz and Garrett McKay, from the University of Colorado at Boulder, are studying the photochemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM is a mixture of organic molecules present in all aquatic environments. DOM impacts many environmental processes, including the degradation of organic contaminants in water. A fraction of the DOM absorbs sunlight, and this fraction is commonly referred to as chromophoric DOM (CDOM).  Once CDOM absorbs light, it can form a collection of reactive species, including the hydroxyl radical (OH) and other species that react in a similar manner through hydroxylation reactions. These species collectively impact how organic contaminants are degraded in the environment.  The results from this study help environmental chemists better understand the fate and transport of organic contaminants in surface waters. Data from the research are incorporated into a course and disseminated in seminars. <br/>The mechanism by which OH and other hydroxylating species are photochemically produced from CDOM remain unclear. Overall, the measured quantum yields for the production of OH from CDOM are very small. The low steady-state concentration and transient nature of OH require the use of probe compounds for its measurement. Over the past decade, a consensus has grown that OH formation from CDOM photolysis can be apportioned into both free OH as well as OH-like species, which are lower in energy and less reactive than free OH. The latter of these species reacts with OH probes to produce products identical to reaction with free OH. The contribution of OH-like species to overall OH reactivity is up to 50% in some instances, and thus OH-like oxidants produced from CDOM photolysis play an important role in environmental photochemical processes, and ultimately in the degradation of organic contaminants. This project focuses on characterizing the formation and reactivity of OH-like species produced in CDOM photohydroxylation reactions. To accomplish this, two aspects are evaluated. First, Drs. Rosario-Ortiz and McKay characterize the reactivity and identity of low-energy oxidants produced in CDOM photochemistry. Second, the relationship between CDOM composition and reactivity towards formation of low-energy oxidants in CDOM photohydroxylation reactions is being investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These intermediates are known to play a major role during the formation of pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and particulate matter. Gas phase and high temperature reactions are investigated both experimentally and computationally. Experimental studies employ spectroscopic methods to characterize intermediates and their chemical behavior. This research provides critical information on reaction mechanisms that will be used to develop  more efficient combustion processes for transportation and power generation.

These radicals can build up in appreciable concentrations and have recently been hypothesized as precursors to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot. The concentration of these radicals in the gas phase is depleted mostly by oxidation reactions with very reactive species, such as the hydroxyl radical. Although theoretical studies have been performed to predict their reactivity toward the hydroxyl radicals, no experimental data are available to validate these predictions. The experimental study of radical - radical reactions is difficult because both radicals need to be formed simultaneously at sufficient concentrations. Professor Goulay and his Group produce both radicals in a flow reactor using laser photolysis, and detect their concentrations using laser spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Theoretical calculations are used to analyze the reaction mechanisms.

Such collisions occur when molecules are being analyzed using instruments called mass spectrometers, which identify molecules and their fragments according to their mass and electric charge. The accuracy of the mass spectral analysis depends on how well the collisions are understood. This project examines the importance of the molecular shape and of common biological modifications on the collisions and the molecular products generated by the collisions. Proteins are synthesized in living cells by molecular machines called ribosomes, which translate the information stored in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) into proteins. Modifications of the proteins after translation are called ""post-translational"" modifications (PTMs).

The CSP vision is to design, demonstrate and develop economically competitive polymers that combine product performance and negligible environmental impact, resulting in tangible societal benefit. The work of the Center is divided into three thrust areas. Thrust I focuses on the development of new methods to convert plant-based resources into viable starting materials for polymer synthesis based on traditional chemical methods and by harnessing the biochemical action of microorganisms. These and other starting materials are converted into polymers in Thrust II using new environmentally friendly techniques that are more efficient and more effective than currently practiced technologies. Thrust III focuses on translating these advances into competitive materials using sophisticated polymer architectures that lead to improved and sustainable plastics, elastomers, and thermosets. The CSP aims to impact society by transforming the US polymer industry to a more sustainable enterprise while enhancing the education and career development of students and young scientists involved with the Center. Additional broad impact will be realized through the engagement of Center personnel with public policy experts, interactive exhibits at the Minnesota State Fair that teach concepts of sustainable chemistry to the general public, development of curricular materials related to sustainable polymers and green chemistry for students of all ages, research opportunities for underrepresented groups in the sciences, and a comprehensive Industrial Affiliates Program that integrates commercial relevance and facilitates innovation. <br/><br/>Thrust I, Next Generation Feedstocks, is focused on conversion of inexpensive bio-based molecules such as saccharides, triglycerides and terpenes to monomers that can be used to generate both established and new polymers. The monomers are produced using both chemical processes, such as catalytic reductions and selective functionalizations, and metabolic processes involving biocatalysis by organisms. For example, new routes to commodity and next-generation monomers using catalytic deoxygenation reactions are being developed. High throughput screening efforts for these methods are being utilized in conjunction with computational modeling approaches to help guide the choice of catalyst species. Microbial hosts are being reengineered to help produce several different families of functionalized hydrocarbon monomers suitable for subsequent polymerization. This strategy leads to flexible pathways by which chain length and functionality in the resulting monomer can be altered. In Thrust II, Controlled Polymerization Processes, Center investigators are searching for methods to convert biobased monomers into polymers with precisely controlled molecular structures. Here center researchers are implementing precision catalytic transformations that allow for highly selective and efficient polymerization processes. In addition, new routes to recyclable crosslinked thermosets and the development of new sugar-based polyesters, carbonates, and acrylates are being pursued. And the final Thrust III area, Hybrid Polymer Structures, addresses how sophisticated and revolutionary polymer architectures such as multiblock polymers can be exploited to uncover new and innovative properties based on sustainable polymer building blocks. This work includes computational strategies that aid in guiding the synthetic efforts. Integration of these three scientific focus areas, and collaboration with industrial partners, ensures that the ultimate goal of the Center, economically competitive and high performance sustainable products, becomes reality."

Non-target compounds can vastly outnumber known target compounds, and may be closely associated with, and strongly indicative of, the presence of target pollutants.  Experimental data often contains rich information about non-target compounds, but this information is rarely tracked in studies of environmental pollution or considered in regulatory policies. The Sen Gupta and Hornbuckle groups are addressing this gap by devising a novel suite of computational techniques to enhance recovery of information from complex experimental data. Their work is applicable to a wide range of chemical pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other industrial pollutants in city air; nitrates and arsenic in rural well-water; and hydrocarbon pollution from marine oil spills.  Beyond the scientific advances in pollution studies, the work is actively engaging women and other underrepresented groups through graduate and undergraduate research mentoring.<br/><br/>The Sen Gupta/Hornbuckle team is devising a suite of computational techniques to examine raw instrument signal (primarily from gas chromatography and mass spectrometry) and to autonomously detect contributions from both target and non-target compounds, enabling quantitation of their relative associations in environmental contamination. The approach combines non-linear optimization, geometric clustering, and graph-based multi-scale networks, where the target analytes form the local neighborhood hub and non-targets cluster around the target hubs forming dense association sub-graphs. Techniques are validated across multiple data repositories and multiple applications, seeking unprecedented comprehensive interpretation of raw chromatographic and mass spectrometric signals. Specific objectives include: (i) discovery of ""hidden peaks"" that co-elute with target compounds; (ii) identification of associations between target and non-target compounds to enhance identification of contamination pathways; and (iii) provision of tools enabling integration of diverse data repositories, potentially transforming understanding of environmental contamination pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Presently, many compounds and even entire classes of compounds are unsuitable for analysis by conventional crystallography methods.  This project combines lattice prediction methods with experimental NMR data to provide new methodology capable of solving structural problems that are now intractable.  This outcome will impact society by improving the ability to characterize a host of new materials.  For example, nearly 60 cephalosporin antibiotics have been described since 1955, yet over 93% in the structures have never been characterized crystallographically. The project focuses on characterizing key cephalosporins as well as other challenging materials.<br/><br/>This project focuses on improving the theoretical prediction of crystal structure by including experimental solid-state NMR data in the prediction process.  The NMR data serve to identify a single high-probability conformation before the prediction process.  Because many lattice prediction programs robustly and accurately treat rigid structures but are challenged by flexibility, the NMR data improves prediction by limiting the conformational space searched.  The experimental NMR measurements focus primarily on 13C and 15N chemical shift tensors because such data provide three measurable parameters for each molecular position.  Uncertainties in atomic positions are provided through a molecular dynamics process, to ultimately create structures suitable for deposit into crystallographic databases.  The broader impact of this work includes training students from a primarily undergraduate institution (Washington and Jefferson College) in an annual three week NMR course involving 6-8 students, the creation of a series of Open Courseware lectures describing basic NMR concepts and the more specialized tensor measurement methods, and outreach into the scouting community of central Florida through lab tours and voluntary teaching of merit badge courses."

These approaches provide information about the atoms and molecules present, but also cause unwanted chemical reactions and surface roughening. This team is developing easy-to-use analysis software to account for these ""nonlinear"" effects. The result is that the quality of surface chemical analysis data is improved, and this advances research in fields ranging from energy, to electronics, to advanced materials, to biotechnology. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the critically important fields of surface characterization, data analysis, numerical methods, and high-performance computing. <br/><br/>This project focuses on two types of nonlinearity in chemical imaging: quantitative modeling of matrix effects in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging of organic surfaces, and resolution of chemical damage and roughening in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling of complex oxides. Extraction of sample properties in the presence of these nonlinearities is addressed through physical modeling within a Bayesian framework, which is made possible through a combination of theoretical developments, modern computing power, improvements in experimental protocols, and physical understanding of the underlying phenomena. In order to promote the use and further development of advanced data analysis in chemical imaging, software developed in this project is freely distributed and promoted as a community resource, along with online exercises that illustrate its use and application.

These tools - which combine and enhance the capabilities of ion mobility and mass spectrometric measurements - may provide new biochemical insights which have thus far not been possible to obtain with existing tools.  This in turn may offer new insights into the functioning of cells and the causes of disease.  Impact is enhanced through interactions with academic and industrial collaborators, and by broad dissemination of ideas and results (including software tools) to potential users through websites, workshops, and tutorials.

Ion mobility spectrometry - mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) methods have recently been shown to be capable of studying such transient conformations but still suffer from two major shortcomings: the relationship between the protein structure elucidated by IMS-MS and the biologically active structure in solution is poorly understood, and detailed protein structures are largely inaccessible from IMS-MS data. Dr. Bleiholder and his team are approaching these challenges by developing new experimental and computational approaches for obtaining and interpreting time-resolved IMS-MS data.  To assess the accuracy of protein structure elucidation from IMS-MS data, the team is assessing how long and to what extent native protein structures can be retained in the gas phase.  Computational methods are being developed and assessed for their ability to identify the structure of a protein from only its cross section distribution.  Finally, the developed computational methods is disseminated in a form that is easy to use by non-experts in order to enable a wider IMS-MS community to elucidate protein structures accurately."

In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length.

Sequence-defined polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting, drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus. The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and establish practical methodologies to this aim.

The resulting mathematical relationships then can be used to predict the performance of new catalysts without spending the labor or materials to make the compounds.

This program is highly collaborative in that several researchers are involved in applying Dr. Sigman's techniques to modern goals in catalysis. Dr. Sigman is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon his research.

SCP was introduced several decades ago in solid-state physics. While potentially very powerful, until recently SCP was essentially limited to systems with simple pairwise interactions. The breakthrough algorithmic improvements introduced in Professor Mandelshtam's group made it possible to reduce the computational times by several orders of magnitude, thus, making SCP practical for general systems. Further algorithmic improvements are being pursued that should make SCP even more efficient, such as an algorithm that would replace an iterative self-consistent solution of coupled non-linear equations by a deterministic minimization procedure. SCP is being applied to compute the spectra and other equilibrium properties of water and ion-water clusters.   Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is also being used to complement these studies and to help assess the accuracy of SCP. The major focus associated with the development of the Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM) is its implementation for 3D Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY), which is a unique and potentially very powerful Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment designed to characterize mixtures in solutions. DOSY is currently limited in its applications due to the lack of an adequate inversion algorithm associated with the solution of the inverse Laplace transform problem.

In this way, the synthesis and testing of new catalysts can be prioritized based on predicted stereoselectivities and catalytic activities across a range of substrates.  AARON is designed to identify novel bifunctional hydrogen bonding catalysts and chiral phosphoric acids for several reactions and to unravel the origin of stereoselectivity in ion-pairing catalysis. The development of an accompanying graphical interface for AARON enable its widespread use among organic chemists, while an online public database provides access to transition state structures, energies, and stereoselectivities, facilitating the application of modern data analysis tools to these rich datasets.

The interactions between these ions and water molecules at the atomic and molecular level determine the rate at which they move in solution and their reactivity, which affect the outcomes and efficiency of the chemistry involved. Because of the complexity of ion interactions with the many solvent molecules in solution, it is difficult to understand these processes to optimize them or to predict the effects of changing conditions such as concentration or temperature. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Duncan addresses these challenges using new techniques to make and study small molecular assemblies known as ""clusters"" containing individual ions imbedded in a few solvent molecules of water. The composition of these clusters is controlled by selecting ions attached to a specific number of water molecules using a mass spectrometer. The structure of these ions and the solvent network surrounding them is determined by measuring the distinctive patterns of infrared light that the clusters absorb. Studies on clusters containing a single water molecule up to dozens or more allow systematic investigation of the initial solvent organization around the ion and the eventual development of the full complexity of the liquid solution. Additionally, the work trains students in the design and operation of vacuum systems and mass spectrometers, as well as optical experiments using lasers. A partnership with a minority faculty member at Emory University facilitates the recruitment of minority students.<br/><br/>The project investigates cation-solvent clusters in which the charge carrier is either a protonated molecular species (e.g., protonated acetylene or CO2) or a transition metal atom, and the solvent is usually water. M+(H2O)n complexes are produced by pulsed laser ablation, whereas protonated ions are produced in a pulsed discharge. The ions are cooled via supersonic expansion in a molecular beam, mass-analyzed and selected with a time-of-flight spectrometer, and studied with infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy. The measured vibrational patterns are compared to those predicted by computational chemistry for different isomeric configurations to determine the structures of these clusters and how this changes with the number of solvent molecules present. The performance of anharmonic vibrational theory methods is also evaluated. Ion photofragment imaging experiments investigate the bonding energetics and charge transfer processes in these systems. The molecular level understanding of ion solvation is a universal challenge for Chemistry and Biology. The structures of molecular ions and how they respond to solvation represent severe obstacles for present levels of theory. Benchmark data from our experiments are of value to computational researchers as they validate and refine their high-level anharmonic theory methods.  The results from the Duncan laboratory may also influence molecular dynamics simulations of solutions or their interfaces. Small protonated ions are also interesting for interstellar chemistry; data can guide higher resolution measurements needed for interstellar ion identification and suggest new ions for consideration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas liquids in common use today consist of neutral molecules, ionic liquids are comprised of only charged species, ions like Na+ and Cl-, the constituents of common table salt. Although the strong attraction between such small ions renders NaCl, solid except at very high temperatures, by increasing the sizes of the component ions and doing other things to inhibit solidification, one can create purely ionic materials that remain liquid at room temperature. Insufficient understanding of how to predict the basic aspects of ionic liquids important in these applications, such as how quickly a solute molecule moves through a given ionic liquid, hampers their applications. Professor Maroncelli and his group use a combination of experimental and theoretical tools to address this challenge by studying how the structure and dynamics of ionic liquids determine the friction experienced in molecular movements. <br/><br/>The Penn State research team is using computer simulations, supplemented by some NMR experiments, to construct a predictive understanding of molecular transport and re-orientional dynamics in ionic liquids, in particular how these dynamics depend upon the structure of a given liquid and the chemical makeup of its ions. The first project entails molecular dynamics simulations coupled to statistical analysis of experimental data on solute diffusion in order to develop models that can be used to predict the behavior new solute - ionic liquid combinations of potential technological interest. The second project uses a combination of simulation and theory to interpret apparently anomalous results obtained when the technique positron annihilation spectroscopy (PALS) was recently applied to ionic liquids. PALS is a well-known method for measuring voids in polymeric materials, but its recent use in ionic liquids provided seemingly unrealistic results. Because void structure is central to theories of molecular transport, this project seeks to learn how to correctly interpret PALS data in ionic liquids. The final project involves simulations and NMR experiments of solute rotations in order to explore how voids change over time and how these void dynamics may influence chemical reactions."

Microalgae uptake nutrients out of their environment. Inorganic nutrients are converted by the microalgae into organic biomass. The release of pollutants or contaminants into an ecosystem can alter ecosystems. The hypothesis of this work is that a microalgae's chemical signature, and their biomass production, can reflect the status of an ecosystem. The rationale for performing chemical analyses on microalgae complemented by novel data modeling, is to investigate the microalgae's capabilities regarding compound uptake and transformation when exposed to chemically changing ecosystems. The scientific broader impacts are manifested in that microalgae accumulate a history of environmental events and conditions. Deciphering these events becomes feasible and allows for the detection of past and possibly lingering, ecosystem threats. Educational broader impacts include instructional improvements in instrumental analysis courses. Chemometrics, the mathematical and statistical methods used to improve the understanding and use of chemical information, is highly relevant for the chemical workforce, but is often perceived to be very difficult for students due to the required level of math and computer skills. This work provides tools for students to develop their own computer controlled instruments. <br/><br/>Adaptions of microalgal biomass regarding their chemical composition and quantities in response to their environment are studied by means of infrared spectroscopy and flow cytometry. Moreover, novel chemometric modeling strategies are developed to design predictive models that link the status, or chemical signature, of microalgae and an ecosystem. This combination of experimental and computational methodologies leads to knowledge about sources and sinks of (anthropogenic) compounds within an ecosystem. Gaining an in-depth understanding of interactions between environmental pollutants and microalgae living in a polluted environment is of importance for understanding the current status, and possibly predicting the future status, of an ecosystem. Microalgae can then be converted into environmental in-situ probes or sensors. Student training in this project bridges the all-too-common gap between analytical chemistry and data modeling. Underserved students in this geographic area also have exposure to local industrial research andchemical production facilities."

Tanner from the University of Missouri-Columbia to study a new class of flavoenzymes in which the flavin does not play a redox role in catalysis. Enzymes that contain riboflavin (vitamin B2) are known as flavoenzymes.  In general, flavoenzymes utilize the properties of the flavins to catalyze oxidation/reduction chemistry. These reactions involve movement of electrons and changes in oxidation state as one compound is converted into another.  Recently, new functionalities have been demonstrated for several flavoenzymes that do not involve changes in oxidation state for the flavin or the compounds involved in the reactions.  For example, the flavin can act as an acid or base instead.  Such flavoenzymes are referred to as atypical.  One focus of the project is to discover the protein-flavin interactions that tune the flavin for this novel reactivity.  The second objective is the characterization of 2-haloacrylate hydratase (2-HAH), an atypical flavoenzyme involved in bioremediation of halogenated compounds.  Preliminary data suggest that the way the 2-HAH reaction is catalyzed may be unprecedented.  Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this project will gain interdisciplinary training in chemistry, biochemistry, and structural biology. <br/><br/>The class of atypical flavoenzymes has been much less studied compared to traditional flavin oxidoreductases.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the conserved three-dimensional structural features of atypical flavoenzymes that enable the flavin to be a nucleophile, electrophile, or acid/base rather than a traditional redox cofactor.  Two atypical flavoenzymes will be studied: 1) UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) and 2) 2-haloacrylate hydratase (2-HAH).  The main goal is to formulate the biochemical and structural principles that govern the chemical reactivity of atypical flavoenzymes.  The analysis of the available structural and mechanistic data on UGM resulted in a hypothesis about the structural and dynamic elements that endow flavins with new chemical activities.  This hypothesis will be tested using site directed mutagenesis of UGM, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations.  2-HAH is a recently identified flavoprotein that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate from 2-haloacrylate.  There is no net-redox change in this reaction; however, there is an absolute requirement for the reduced flavin for activity.  In addition, light greatly enhances the rate of reduction of the enzyme by NAD(P)H, which is not normally seen for atypical flavoenzymes.  The role of the reduced flavin in the 2-HAH reaction and the mechanism of light activation will be investigated.  X-ray crystallography will be employed to solve the three-dimensional structure of 2-HAH."

They seek to understand the molecular detail of how an odor is detected and communicated from the female moth to the male moth within a species during the mating process. The ability to respond to chemical stimuli such as odors is a fundamental behavior of all organisms. This project is utilizing structural and biochemical experiments to discover the basic mechanism of odor communication in two moth species, one of which is a voracious pest of crops and stored foods. Computationally-designed molecules are being synthesized and tested in the laboratory for their ability to competitively bind to odor-binding protein molecules to inhibit the sensing of female-secreted scent by the male, and thus disrupt the mating process.  Knowledge gained from this research is helping bridge the fundamental gap in knowledge of the chemical and mechanistic details of sense of smell in animals, as well as paving the way for the development of novel, species-specific, and environmentally-friendly odor mimetics as alternatives to harmful pesticides, for insect control. Students at the undergraduate and graduate levels are being trained in state-of-the-art instrumentation, thus preparing the future generation of teachers, researchers, and innovators.<br/><br/>Insects use insoluble fatty acid (FA) derivatives as highly-specific signaling molecules. Lepidopteran insects serve as a model for studying the biochemical and physiological mechanisms of FA signaling. Odor/pheromone binding proteins (OBP/PBP) ferry the fatty acid odor to the odorant receptor across the aqueous sensillar lymph that surrounds the dendrites of odor-sensitive olfactory neurons. The details of the mechanism of lipid transfer to the olfactory receptor neuron by OBPs/PBPs remain largely unknown. This project is using the combined tools and techniques of biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, chemical modeling, and synthetic organic chemistry to identify the chemical signatures in the protein sequences that dictate the mechanism of lipid binding and release by PBPs in two lepidopteran species: Anthereae polyphemus and Ostrinia furnacalis. The current model for lepidopteran PBPs, including Anthereae polyphemus PBP (ApolPBP1), posits a pH-dependent conformational switch for the uptake and release of the FA signal at the sensory neuron membrane. However, preliminary data for Ostrinia furnacalis PBP (OfurPBP2) suggests that this protein binds lipid and releases it through a distinct, novel mechanism.  A strategy of successive mutations in ApolPBP1 residues is being used to systematically transform ApolPBP1 into an OfurPBP2 mimic, and characterize the mutants at each step using a multidisciplinary approach, to gain insight into the unique structure-function relationship and mechanism of lipid binding and release in Ostrinia furnacalis.  Nature-inspired design of fatty-acid mimetics is being performed through structure-based organic synthesis, to develop a competitive inhibitor of ApoIPBP1 as a model system, and establish a design strategy for odor inhibition in the Ostrinia furnicalis pest.  This combined, complementary data on two key PBP proteins is deepening the understanding of distinct mechanisms of chemical sensing, and providing a foundation for the rational design of eco-friendly biomimetic inhibitors for insect control.

These structures are of great interest, as they provide a new way to control bulk properties of substances. For example, properties of pharmaceutical substances such as solubility and bioavailability may be altered by co-crystallizing the agent with an excipient. Co-crystals are often made using mechanochemistry (e.g., grinding the co-forming solids together), while others form spontaneously by simply mixing powders. Dr. Mehta seeks to enhance the understanding of these mechanisms using a combination of solid-state magnetic resonance, X-ray and neutron diffraction, and computational methods. The insight gleaned from these studies should help to inform the design and synthesis of co-crystalline materials with desired properties in the future.

Professor Sarlah is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The underlying theme of the work is to bridge the gap between the chemistry of carbon-carbon double bonds, an extensively studied area, and the chemistry of aromatic compounds, which have three such double bonds in a six-membered ring. Replacing the double bonds with single bonds allows for the rapid and controlled conversion of cheap, readily accessible compounds into high-value, complex molecules. This work may have broad applications in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. The project is conceptually interesting and has many potential applications, making it well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Sarlah is also pioneering an outreach program, Science in Action (SIA), that provides crucial hands-on science education for underrepresented students in the greater Champaign, IL area. Through the SIA program, graduate students in the department, in collaboration with local teachers, bring instructive science experiences to children in low-income schools.<br/><br/>Dearomatization reactions are an important class of transformations in organic synthesis.  These transformations convert readily available arenes into useful synthetic intermediates with diverse applications. Whereas most modern dearomatization processes do not incorporate functionality into the aromatic framework, the proposed research aims to develop a general dearomative method that enables introduction of a wide range of functional groups. Specifically, this research describes the dearomative photocycloaddition of small molecules that enables in situ alkene-type chemistry of the resulting cycloadducts into a diverse array of partially unsaturated, functionalized products. With subsequent manipulations, this strategy permits access to a variety of substituted cyclohexadienes and di-, tri-, or tetrasubstituted cyclohexenes that are otherwise difficult to access through known methods. These classes of products are useful intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other fine chemicals. The educational component of this project includes the development of the Science in Action program, which brings accessible science education to low-income schools in central Illinois. With the help of local teachers and other UIUC research groups, the initial model program has been expanded to reach a broader audience and extended to a wider range of science topics."

In this project, the conformations and conformational changes of NOS are tracked by time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence techniques.

NOS is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes formation of nitric oxide by shuttling electrons from modules in one monomer to the heme in the oxygenase domain of the other. Electron transfer in both domains depends on calmodulin binding. Because electron transfer only occurs when the electron donor and electron acceptor are in close proximity, conformational changes must occur to bring different donor and acceptor couples together sequentially. The time scales of interchange among conformational states are not known, nor is it clear how the observed conformational changes correlate with the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. The methods of the project correlate conformations and dynamics detected by fluorescence with knowledge of inter-domain interactions at the peptide level. These inter-domain interactions are observed from hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry. To identify and assign conformational states observed, selected site-directed mutants that disrupt specific subdomain interactions are probed by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry.

Laird of the University of Kansas is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division for the theoretical and computational study of solid-liquid interface.  Such interfaces are common in nature and technology, from the commonly observed interface between ice and water to the surfaces of nanoparticles in solution. Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of such interfaces is important in a broad array of fields including chemistry, materials science, nano-engineering, metallurgy, colloidal science and biophysics. For example, the energy cost in forming a particular solid-liquid interface control whether the liquid completely covers (or wets) the solid surface or instead, beads up into droplets, like water on a freshly waxed car. Direct experimental study of solid-liquid interfaces, however, is difficult - especially for metallic systems where high temperatures and lack of transparency to spectroscopic probes severely limit experimental study. As a result, computational methods have been crucial in developing a detailed atomic-level picture of the interfacial region. In this work, molecular simulation techniques are used to examine, at an atomic level, the properties of so-called chemically heterogeneous solid-liquid interfaces; namely, interfaces in which the solid and liquid phases are significantly different in chemical composition. The particular systems used in this study were chosen specifically to address fundamental questions in interface science, while at the same time be relevant to specific technological applications, such as understanding the stability of nanoparticles in solution, mechanisms for metal embrittlement and the growth of sapphire nanowires. The project also contributes to the training of students and postdocs in the techniques of computational chemistry, liquid-state physics and materials science and affords them a considerable experience in advanced scientific programming. These skills have wide use in a vast array of applications in chemistry, engineering, materials science, pharmaceutical science, biology and physics and gives them considerable marketability in any aspect of computational science and technology. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposed research is to understand, on a fundamental molecular level, how the thermodynamic and structural properties of chemically heterogeneous solid-liquid interfaces are shaped by atomic and molecular interactions and interfacial geometry.  This effort requires both (a) the development, evaluation and application of new computational methods and force fields to study the interfaces between condensed phases and (b) the extension of existing methods to classes of systems beyond those for which the methods were developed. In this project, a concerted program of method development, molecular-dynamics simulations and applied statistical mechanics is developed to perform a systematic study of the thermodynamics and structure of chemically heterogeneous solid-liquid interfaces. The project focuses specifically on three classes of systems: (a) Chemically heterogeneous metal/metal solid-liquid interfaces, in particular a study of the interface between aluminum and liquid gallium, which is of interest as a model system for the study of liquid-metal embrittlement. (b) Metal/metal-oxide solid-liquid interfaces using the alumina(s)/Al(l) interface as a test-bed - a system which provides a rare opportunity to directly compare experiment and simulation results for a solid-liquid interface at the atomic level. (c) Fluids at curved surfaces. The curvature dependence of the interfacial free energy for a number of systems is investigated including fluids at corrugated surfaces, convex colloidal particles and convex surfaces. Results are examined to assess the validity of Morphometric Thermodynamics, a recently developed theory of curved surface thermodynamics."

This task is conducted annually in March during the Atlanta Science Festival, Georgia?s biggest science fair that showcases science and technology<br/>to the general public. Specifically, the research group puts on a ?rock show? where the general public, students, and science educators have the opportunities to learn mineral properties with hands-on demonstrations of parameters such as color, hardness, texture, and chemical alteration. They also develop a kit for the demonstration of biomineralization and mineral-facilitated environmental remediation such as microscope and visual observation of microbial Mn oxidation and color changes during chemical reactions.<br/><br/>Manganese oxides play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of many important nutrients and contaminants. Still, much remains unknown about the influence of ubiquitous metal impurities on the structure, reactivity, and transformation pathways of biogenic Mn oxides. This knowledge is needed to develop accurate predictive models for understanding the fate of contaminants and nutrients in the natural environment. This project systematically examines the changes in biogenic Mn oxide reactivities when they are formed in the presence of common metal ions. The processes of geological and environmental interest include sorption of cations and anions, and abiotic reductive transformation induced by Mn(II). Controlled laboratory studies lead to predictive insight into the relative importance of different metal ions in controlling Mn oxide reactivity."

The methods of the project correlate conformations and dynamics detected by fluorescence with knowledge of inter-domain interactions at the peptide level. These inter-domain interactions are observed from hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry. To identify and assign conformational states observed, selected site-directed mutants that disrupt specific subdomain interactions are probed by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry. The project may lead to a detailed model of NOS function that describes the conformational sequences and rates of conformational changes. The project may also demonstrate how the conformational sequences are related to enzyme regulation.  The project provides training in advanced fluorescence and mass spectrometric techniques for graduate students at Kansas University and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Undergraduate students from all participating institutions are trained in interdisciplinary science research. The project also offers training for members of the UKanTeach program which trains science majors as high school science teachers."

Professor Shaw discovers new reactions that enable simple, chemical starting materials to be converted into complex molecules with control of their overall shape. To accomplish this, Professor Shaw and his students are exploring three under explored modes of chemical reactivity.  Each of these use a well-known molecular fragment, an anhydride, in a new way. The new reactions involve both the development of the new methods and an exploration of the factors that control the speed and specificity of the new reactions.  Professor Shaw is the founding host of the Davis Science Cafe, which is a monthly event that brings scientists together to describe their work to the general public. This project support efforts to maximize the impact of the Science Cafe and other outreach events and bolster the spread of science communication in Northern California. This project also supports an array of outreach activities to achieve the goal of science education at all levels, including participation in a science fair at an elementary school, work with middle and high school students at Chemistry Camp for the Blind, and the revival of the Chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Latinos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) at UC Davis. This research may provide new, innovative approaches and advanced manufacturing opportunities for the chemical industry. <br/> <br/>Although the chemistry of anhydrides is dominated by their ability to serve as electrophilic acylating agents, new advances in the Shaw group exploit the ability of these compounds to serve as versatile nucleophiles. This project is pursuing three specific avenues of inquiry. First, the addition of anhydrides to alpha-chiral imines has shown stereocontrol that defy the rules established for carbonyl compounds. A broad investigation of the outcomes of these reactions paired with computational studies is being used to build a new stereochemical model to describe the behavior of imines in reactions with soft nucleophiles, i.e. electron-rich alkenes. Second, the base-mediated and, if possible, catalyzed reactions of anhydrides with new electrophiles are being studied. This effort involves the synthesis of a new class of chiral catalysts and the development of addition reactions between anhydrides and electron-deficient alkenes and aziridines. Third, the reactions of anhydride enol silanes is being nvestigated. Although a small number of these compounds have been made, the Shaw group has discovered new organocatalytic reactions that enable the reactivity to be steered toward at least two different products with the same imine electrophile. This investigation complements previous work examining the reactions of imines with anhydrides by providing novel reactivity leading to new and interesting products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When the titanium dioxide particle size is on the order of 0.00000005 inches, TiO2 exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, a chemical phenomenon in which the TiO2 increases the efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes by providing alternative reaction pathways.  In recent years, the low cost and non-toxic properties of titanium dioxide nanocatalysts have led to their commercialization for solar water purification in third-world countries, for flexible solar cells fabricated by roll-to-roll printing, and for self-cleaning building materials. While chemists have long known that the reactivity of these nanocrystals depends critically on their shape and structure, there is little fundamental understanding of these dependencies and thus no rational means for improving their performance. In this research project, Prof. Melissa Hines and her graduate students at Cornell University are using atomic-scale microscopy to study the structure and reactivity of a variety of small molecules during their interaction with titanium dioxide surfaces. Using insights gained from these experiments, she and her students are developing new methods to improve the performance of these crystals, including the growth of surface-supported, nanoscale networks. The fundamental understanding gained from these experiments will help future applications, such as new types of batteries or solar cells with improved performance. To share their enthusiasm about science with school children, she and her group are developing hands-on science lessons for middle school students, visiting schools to perform these experiments, and contributing these lessons to an online lending library of science experiments for teachers nationwide.<br/><br/>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Melissa A. Hines of Cornell University and her students are using solution-based chemical reactions and surface science techniques to produce the fundamental understanding necessary for the development of sustainable, non-toxic, earth-abundant nanocatalysts, photocatalysts, photovoltaic devices, and energy-storage materials. The research uses solution-deposited, self-assembled monolayers of molecular exemplars to study the atomic-scale structure of seven of the most commonly used organic linkages to metal oxide surfaces. These monolayers are deposited on the surfaces of well-controlled rutile (110) single crystals and epitaxial anatase (001) films and studied with a combination of experimental and computational techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy, infrared and x-ray photoemission spectroscopies, and first-principles modeling. This research is producing the understanding necessary for the rational development of high strength and/or high conductivity organic coatings on metal oxide nanocatalysts and thin films, while also developing the high quality self-assembled monolayers necessary for electronic characterization of molecule-titanium dioxide linkages. The organic linkage chemistries are being explored for use in a new class of surface-supported, highly porous, conducting nanoscale networks. Coupled with this research, Hines and her group are developing new hands-on science experiments that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards and suitable for the middle school classroom. The group field tests these activities in K-12 classrooms and through teacher development programs. The finished experiments are made available to any teacher in the nation through an online lending library."

Over the past three decades, the basic building blocks of computer chips have shrunk to nanometer dimensions, or about 1000 times smaller than a human hair. In this size range, nanostructures exhibit new properties and behaviors that are not observed in their bulk counterparts.  The appearance of new nanomaterials that change their shape when exposed to light have the potential to impact many different technologies. However, watching a single particle change its shape in the laboratory presents unique challenges, since the time needed to switch from one form to the other is exceedingly short and cannot be captured by the fastest camera. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Renske M. Van der Veen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is building a microscope that uses very short bursts of electrons (less than a millionth of a millionth of a second) to watch as a single nanostructure change its shape in response to light.  Professor Van der Veen and her students are using this microscope to gain fundamental insight into the cascade of switching events that occur in metal-organic nanomaterials after light excitation. The results from this work could impact technologies ranging from data storage to optical switches in telecommunication, and thus could have significant benefit to society. As part of this CARRER project, Professor Van der Veen is developing new educational activities that will train the next generation of scientists in this emerging experimental methodology.<br/><br/>Room temperature photoswitching is highly desired for realistic applications in functional devices. This project is advancing our understanding of first-order thermal phase transitions with cooperative hysteresis phenomena that occur around room temperature. Photoexcitation inside the hysteresis region may lead to efficient, ""complete"" switching of magnetic, dielectric and/or structural properties at the single-nanoparticle level.

Transient absorption spectroscopy, ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy at synchrotron facilities, and a newly developed ultrafast electron microscope are used to investigate the interplay between structural and electronic degrees of freedom after photoexcitation. The project is also studying the mechanisms, time scales and efficiencies pertinent to cooperative photoswitching.

Information obtained from this research may be useful in assessing and predicting the potential health effects of peptoids.  The results could lead to applications of peptoids in medical technologies, either as drugs or as components of biosensors or medical devices. The research is performed at a primarily undergraduate institution, where exposure of undergraduate students to authentic research experiences both in teaching and research labs engages a diverse cross-section of students, including women and underrepresented minorities.

Educational exercises utilizing research-derived data is developed to improve quantitative skills of first-generation college (FGC) students in general chemistry.  Undergraduate research students are selected from the FGC student cohort in Professor Stokes' general chemistry course to work in her research lab. Through the research and educational activities, FGC students gain experience using modern laser spectroscopy methods and computational tools, which better prepares them for graduate school and future careers.

The various ""instruments"" communicate with one another through numerous signals, molecules that convey information about the state of the cell.  For the proper function of cells, the timing of signaling is everything.  In order to understand what is going on inside live cells, researchers routinely apply the signaling molecules to cells and observe what happens.  There are serious limitations to this approach because the entire cell is exposed to the signal and timing is largely lost as the compounds find their way inside.  These effects can lead to unintended consequences that can be impossible to sort out.  The proposal aims to overcome these limitations, and to gain control over the exact location and timing of release of specific signaling molecules.  The investigator addresses this pressing need by developing a set of new chemical tools with which reactive signals can be selectively delivered to specific proteins in cells at a precise time. Such a research breakthrough will provide time-resolved information on the chemically directed signal-processing mechanisms of fundamental importance in biology.

Avoiding the conventional whole-cell treatment approaches, this proposal introduces a new chemistry-driven approach to interrogate these interactions by selective chemical perturbation of one target with one inducer at a precise time in an otherwise native/healthy cell. The most recent data from the PI's lab suggest that her new directed modification strategy enables quantitative assessment of target- and electrophile-specific temporal dynamics of individual non-enzyme-assisted protein modification events in living cells. The knowledge of physiologically relevant reactivity and specificity will enable the prediction of how a given reactive small-molecule signal may function within microenvironments of a target in cellular decision-making."

Quantum chemical predictions of chiroptical spectroscopic properties and comparison to corresponding experimental observations are used to further unravel the relation between chiral aggregates and their spectroscopic properties. These studies are expected to help establish the relationship between the structures of chiral aggregates and their chiroptical properties. This work is is also expected to better define the analytical capabilities of chiroptical spectroscopic methods for characterizing chiral aggregates."

With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Teri Odom of Northwestern University is developing a series analytical tools to achieve higher structural and chemical information of single nanoparticles in their native growth environments. Using this toolkit, Professor Odom and her students are identifying key intermediates in nanoparticle formation that could advance our understanding of how complex nanostructures grow. The project could pave the way to create particles with specified shapes that would have broad implications for a range of technologies, including personalized medicine and single-molecule contaminant detection. The project trains future scientists, with outreach efforts focusing on developing a new general chemistry sequence and developing graduate and junior faculty training initiatives. The project also provides training opportunities for future scientists through programs such as 'Nano Scout Day' at the Alder Planetarium.  Professor Odom also actively outreaches to local middle school students targeting underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop correlative tools to study metal nanoparticles and their immediate surrounding environment at the near-in situ, single-particle level. The work combines multiple tools in an integrated strategy to access real-time, statistical, and multi-functional information from individual nanoparticles.

One consequence of this heat flow is that it is difficult to create objects with localized ""hot spots,"" even when heat is applied to a single spot.  When touching a hot pan on the stove, the temperature of the lid on top of the pan is not much different than the bottom where the heat is applied.  Depositing and maintaining thermal energy in a small region of space becomes even more challenging as the object's size approaches the tens to hundreds of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair.  Yet, the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and the local control of chemical reactions to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.

Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.<br/> <br/>Together, the researchers and their students are designing plasmonic nanostructures that exploit Fano interferences to focus and convert optical radiation into precise nanoscopic temperature profiles that are actively tunable from the far-field.  They are developing computer simulations to solve the coupled Maxwell-heat diffusion equations and using them to design novel plasmonic nanostructures with Fano interferences that are capable of localizing spatial temperature profiles at dimensions below the diffraction limit. The best candidates are then created in the laboratory and characterized using optical microscopies. Diffraction-limited, single-nanoparticle photothermal absorption spectroscopy techniques measure the heat power absorbed as well as the associated temperature change induced in the target material.

Kwaku Dayie of the University of Maryland at College Park to examine the structural and dynamic basis of RNA regulation. RNAs are involved in many critical processes in the cell that range from sensing chemicals, speeding up chemical reactions, to controlling virus infections. Yet even though in humans  more than 98% of the DNA is used up for making RNA and less than 2% for making proteins, more than 95% of the structures contained in the Protein Data Bank, a repository of 3D structures of biological molecules, belong to proteins and less than 2% of the structures belong to RNAs. This huge disparity stems from the properties of RNAs that make it harder to determine the structures of the RNAs. Professor Dayie develops new methods for the determination of the RNA structure and fill in this critical knowledge gap. These new strategies make RNA more amenable for structural and dynamic studies and facilitate biotechnology applications. The new reagents generated by the research are made available to the community of scientists who study the structure of RNA, including those from industry and from outside USA. Professor Dayie contributes to an outreach program that introduces high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to methods for the study of the structure of RNA and helps them understand how RNA controls signaling in cells. <br/><br/>The proposed studies provide critical and new solid phase labeling technologies that can enable the filling of a major gap in RNA structural biology, namely the paucity of RNA structures in PDB.  These structures can be used to decipher the molecular basis for the dynamic regulation of gene expression by RNA, which is still poorly understood. Dr. Dayie combines high resolution NMR spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) with chemical labeling technologies to study the dynamic basis of RNA signaling.

While the majority of world-wide glass production focuses on windows and containers, there is growing demand for improved specialty glasses which have become vital to a large range of technological applications, such as handheld electronic devices, displays, optical fibers, glass substrates for lighting, bio-glass implants, and nuclear waste storage.  A major challenge in tailoring the properties of new glass compositions is the inadequacy of available quantitative details about the structure of glasses, which determines their macroscopic (bulk) properties.  NMR is uniquely suited for characterization of this structure.  Professor Grandinetti is developing both sophisticated ""higher-dimensional"" NMR methods, and new approaches to statistical analysis of NMR data to characterize alkali and alkaline-earth silicate and aluminosilicate glasses.  The work will enable better understanding of features contributing to phenomena such as phase separation and properties such as the strength of glasses.  These new insights will help glass scientists and engineers working on the next generation of specialty glasses.

This project explores how to design deep eutectic solvents that improve the efficiency of emitted circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized light emitting materials, such as circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes, have potential application in quantum computing, for generating holographic images, and as security labels. This project engages undergraduate students in research at the interface of physical, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and involves collaboration between undergraduate research students and students enrolled in a physical chemistry laboratory course. <br/><br/>More technically, the goal of this project is to develop circularly polarized light emitting materials based on luminescent lanthanide complexes dissolved in deep eutectic solvents. Deep eutectic solvents are formed from combinations of hydrogen bond acceptor and donors, whose properties can be controlled through choice of components. Therefore, the selection of hydrogen bond acceptor with chiral hydrogen bond donor can generate a deep eutectic solvent that provides both chiral selection and charge carrier properties to enhance electroluminescence of the dissolved lanthanide complexes. This project involves 1) screening chiral hydrogen bond donors for low melting point deep eutectic solvent formation; 2) characterizing the physical properties of the deep eutectic solvents; 3) characterizing the chiroptical properties of lanthanide complexes in the successful deep eutectic solvents; and 4) developing circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes out of the successful deep eutectic solvent/lanthanide systems.

Proteins, the intricate molecular machines that perform the majority of functions necessary to sustain life, are made up of combinations of molecular building blocks known as amino acids, arrayed in long chains. Nature provides twenty different amino acid molecules, and variations in the sequence in which they are chained together leads proteins to adopt diverse three-dimensional folded shapes. These folded shapes, in turn, dictate protein function. In recent years, researchers have shown that a variety of artificial protein backbones, where some of the natural amino acids are replaced by different molecules of approximately the same size, can fold to adopt complex protein-like shapes. Artificial backbones have fundamental value in helping understand how proteins work and also offer practical benefits over their natural counterparts. Small proteins currently find widespread use as agents for the diagnosis and treatment of disease; however, an important limitation to such application is rapid degradation by enzymes that are abundant in the bloodstream. Changing the backbone while keeping side chains intact can create a molecule that mimics the folded shape and biological function of a prototype natural protein but is less prone to degradation in the body. A crucial component in the design of artificial backbones with predictable shapes is understanding how they fold. This project seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which artificial backbones fold through closely-coupled experiments and computational modeling.  This work includes the development of a new force field---the mathematical model describing interactions among the natural and artificial amino acids---for the modeling component of the research.  The force field will be disseminated as open source through the widely-used AMBER molecular dynamics simulation package.  This interdisciplinary, collaborative project is providing a valuable training ground for graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and is supporting diverse educational and outreach activities, including a summer undergraduate creative science writing workshop, guest lectures on issues related to scientific research and science communication, and a three-week workshop on Python coding at a local high school. The creative science writing workshop is being designed and offered by the Chemistry, English, and the History and Philosophy of Science Departments at the University of Pittsburgh, and provides students with joint science and writing mentorship, culminating in submission of one or more capstone pieces for publication in news outlets with broad readership.<br/><br/>A key recent advance that pushed the frontier of structural complexity possible in protein mimetics is the finding that backbone connectivity can be substantially altered without compromising the fold specified by a natural side-chain sequence. Compared to the growing body of structural information on such ""heterogeneous-backbone"" protein mimics, virtually nothing is known about how backbone alteration impacts dynamics or folding pathways. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential to reveal new insights into the folding behavior in artificial backbones, aid in the design of more effective protein mimics, and provide insights into fundamental issues related to natural protein folding. This project is determining how protein backbone connectivity influences chain dynamics and folding mechanisms. The research is guided by the central hypothesis that a combination of experimental biophysical analysis and atomistic computer simulations can reveal the complex interplay among backbone composition, folded structure, chain dynamics, solvation, and folding pathways.  The project includes the design and parameterization of a modified AMBER force field for simulating folding and molecular recognition events involving artificial protein-like backbones, and the development of novel protocols for simulating protein folding processes using the weighted ensemble enhanced sampling strategy. The force field is being disseminated as part of the AMBER molecular dynamics package. The new simulation strategies are being used to model the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetics experiments performed on corresponding protein mimetics synthesized in the PI's lab. This unique combination of experimental and computational research is providing insights into the molecular origins of stability differences between natural proteins and artificial counterparts, folding behavior in artificial-backbone protein mimetics, and the fundamental role of backbone preorganization in protein folding.  The project is providing research training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in state-of-the-art protein design and modeling.  An undergraduate Creative Science Summer Program at the University of Pittsburgh is being expanded, enabling students to develop valuable writing skills in the sciences, to communicate the critical roles that science plays in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project investigates shapes (conformations) and shape changes of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The importance of conformational changes in the function of complex enzymes like NOS has become increasingly recognized. NOS activity requires a sequence of electron transfers between different domains of the enzyme. The hypothesis is that these events are controlled by conformational dynamics. In this project, the conformations and conformational changes of NOS are tracked by time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence techniques. Mass spectrometry shows how domain interactions are regulated by binding to NOS of a calcium signaling protein, calmodulin. The results may show how multi-domain enzymes function through conformational changes. The project provides training in advanced fluorescence and mass spectrometric techniques for graduate students at Kansas University and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Undergraduate students from all participating institutions are trained in interdisciplinary science research.

NOS is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes formation of nitric oxide by shuttling electrons from modules in one monomer to the heme in the oxygenase domain of the other. Electron transfer in both domains depends on calmodulin binding. Because electron transfer only occurs when the electron donor and electron acceptor are in close proximity, conformational changes must occur to bring different donor and acceptor couples together sequentially. The time scales of interchange among conformational states are not known, nor is it clear how the observed conformational changes correlate with the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. The methods of the project correlate conformations and dynamics detected by fluorescence with knowledge of inter-domain interactions at the peptide level. These inter-domain interactions are observed from hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry. To identify and assign conformational states observed, selected site-directed mutants that disrupt specific subdomain interactions are probed by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry. The project may lead to a detailed model of NOS function that describes the conformational sequences and rates of conformational changes. The project may also demonstrate how the conformational sequences are related to enzyme regulation.  The project provides training in advanced fluorescence and mass spectrometric techniques for graduate students at Kansas University and the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Bimetallic nanocrystals, made of two different metal species, have properties that are often superior to their single-metal counterparts. The arrangement of the two different metals relative to each other in the nanocrystal is very important in determining the nanocrystal properties, and considerable effort has been made to deposit one metal atop the nanocrystal surface of another metal with precision in location.  It remains a grand challenge to detect and quantify the metal being deposited, particularly when the nanocrystals are still suspended in the reaction medium undergoing growth. Dr. Dong Qin addresses this challenge by developing a class of molecules, the isocyanides (molecules containing the -NC chemical group), as probes for in situ characterization with detection of the isocyanides by a spectroscopic technique, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The ultimate goal is to establish a scientific basis for enabling the rational synthesis of bimetallic nanocrystals with well-controlled compositions and shapes, which have broader societal impact through their need in a variety of applications. This research project encompasses multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, colloidal science, solid-state physics, photonics, and surface science, with a focus on the following components for student development: i)  active learning in interdisciplinary areas involved in understanding the structure and property relationships of nanomaterials; ii) training that provides hands-on experience in the synthesis of nanomaterials in the Qin laboratory, and on the characterization of nanomaterials in the state-of-the-art facilities at Georgia Tech and national laboratories; and iii) exposing the community and society, including high school students and teachers, to nanoscale science and technology concepts.<br/><br/>In this research, Dr. Dong Qin from the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to study the fundamentals involved in the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of bimetallic nanocrystals. Specifically, a novel class of isocyanide-based molecular probes (R-NC) are developed for in situ detection and analysis of the overgrowth of a second noble metal (M: Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh, or Ru) on Ag nanocrystals suspended in the original growth solution by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Because the binding of the isocyanide group to a metal surface is similar to that of carbon monoxide, it is anticipated that the stretching frequency of the NC bond differs when the isocyanide group binds to the Ag and M atoms, respectively. Therefore, it is feasible to monitor the M atoms being deposited onto Ag nanocrystals by following the stretching frequencies and intensities of NC vibration in real time. On the other hand, the SERS hot spots on the Ag nanocrystals can be designed to coincide with the sites favored by M atoms for heterogeneous nucleation, allowing for unprecedented sensitivity with a detection limit below one monolayer. By leveraging their consummate sensitivity toward metal atoms, the novel SERS probes open up new opportunities to elucidate the mechanistic details involved in the seeded overgrowth of a second noble metal on the surface of Ag nanocrystals. The mechanistic insights support the rational design and knowledge-based synthesis of bi- and multi-metallic nanocrystals for a variety of applications.

The team integrates the skills of a surface physical chemistry group with an organometallic chemistry group to develop an understanding of on-surface redox chemistry to produce well-defined surface reaction sites.  These sites are designed to be uniform due to stoichiometric control and to create a repetitive nanoscale structure of the same reactive site in an arrayed metal-organic surface structure. Applying these strategies of ligand design and metal-complex formation to surface functionalization offers potentially transformative impacts in the fields of catalysis, sensing, and carbon recycling technologies.

For example, fuel cells based on artificial photosynthesis are limited by their slow rates of H2O oxidation. This provides a compelling motivation to understand how Nature's catalyst works.

Professor Kovacs is a member of a mentoring group for female faculty organized by the University of Washington NSF-funded ADVANCE program, and serves as a mentor to female faculty, post docs, and graduate students at Washington and other academic institutions.

These activities are engaging children (ages 3-12) in science-related activities.  <br/><br/><br/>Fundamental scientific research is needed in order to develop methods for efficiently capturing sunlight, and converting its energy into storable fuels.  Nature accomplishes this via photosynthetic H2O oxidation, which converts solar energy into chemical bond energy in the form of electrons and protons, and simultaneously produces the O2 necessary to sustain life on our planet.  Sluggish H2O oxidation catalysts limit the performance of existing fuel cells.  Nature had billions of years to optimize its catalyst, which incorporates both Mn and Ca, and this provides compelling motivation to understand how Nature's catalyst works.  The mechanism of the key O-O bond-forming step to form a peroxo intermediate is not well-understood.  Professor Kovacs' research group is synthesizing site-differentiated heterobimetallic MnCa complexes designed to promote O-O bond formation.  These complexes incorporate a Ca-OH moiety in close proximity to Mn, in order to rapidly trap MnV oxo intermediates, generated via sequential oxidative charging.  Calculations show that the Ca-Mn separations in the synthetic targets require minimal rearrangement for O-O bond formation to occur.  In order to verify that the designed molecules are capable of supporting the peroxo intermediate expected to form following O-O bond formation, independent routes to peroxos are being explored, using a reagent (H2O2) containing an intact, preformed, O-O bond.  Reactions are being monitored in situ at low T, using electronic absorption spectroscopy and EPR, and oxidants are added in a step-wise fashion, thereby providing more control over the O-O bond-forming step.  Professor Kovacs is a member of a Mentoring group for female faculty organized by the UW NSF-funded ADVANCE program, and serves as a mentor to female faculty, post docs, and graduate students at the UW, and at other academic institutions.

At the University of Maryland, Professor Lyle Isaacs' research group studies next generation molecular containers known as cucurbiturils.  By creating a series of new cucurbituril-type containers, studying their basic container properties, and showing how they may be integrated into complex systems, the Isaacs' group enables other academic and industrial labs to adapt cucurbituril molecular containers to applications such as drug delivery and sensing of addictive over-the-counter drugs.

It also has a very high energy density, almost three times higher than gasoline.  The main challenges to using hydrogen as a fuel, however, are its clean production and storage.  Storing hydrogen as a gas requires large cylinders, and storing it as a liquid requires high pressures and very low temperatures. Both methods also present safety challenges.  Dr. Prieto is exploring the use of solid compounds as storage materials for hydrogen.  This approach offers small storage volumes at reasonable pressures.  Light metal hydrides, such as magnesium metal, can store a lot of hydrogen per unit mass, but the drawbacks are that putting the hydrogen into magnesium requires high temperatures and pressures, and removing the hydrogen requires high temperatures and low pressures.  Both processes are very slow.  Dr. Prieto and her students have designed a method of making very small particles of magnesium that display much faster rates for storing hydrogen.  The goal of her work is to determine whether the addition of small amounts of other metals to the surface of the magnesium can further increase the rates of adding or removing the hydrogen from the metal particles.  She uses techniques such as X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption experiments to help model the rates of the hydrogenation reactions and to provide data that aid in developing kinetic models to describe these reactions.  Dr. Prieto involves students ranging from high school to graduate levels in her research, and the practical applications of this work serve as a useful recruiting tool to attract talented students and train them in research aimed at improving energy sustainability.  Prof. Prieto communicates her knowledge of hydrogen storage and energy sustainability to the general public through her role as a board member of the Colorado Clean Energy Cluster, which is directly impacting policy in Colorado for economic development and projects related to clean energy production, storage, and transportation.  This project is used as an example of basic research that can be easily linked to an application interesting to a wide audience, that of clean energy production and storage. <br/><br/>Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for portable applications because it burns cleanly in air to produce water, and it has a very high energy density.  Magnesium (Mg), doped Mg, and Mg alloys are promising materials for hydrogen storage due to their high theoretical hydrogen storage capacities (e.g. 7.6 weight% for MgH2). However, bulk Mg is less than ideal as a hydrogen storage material due to the slow kinetics and high temperatures required for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Dr. Prieto is synthesizing nanoparticles of hydrogen storage materials in which the reduced size results in significantly enhanced kinetics for hydrogen storage.  She is determining the relative roles of kinetics and thermodynamics on the hydrogen sorption and desorption of these particles, particularly upon addition of small amounts of transition metals to the surface. Although faster hydrogenation rates have been observed for nanoscale metal hydrides, very little is known about the roles of increased surface area versus impurities and defects. The targets Dr. Prieto is studying are earth abundant elements that are light and store large amounts of hydrogen, albeit sluggishly in the bulk. With control over the particle size and additive type and position, she can dramatically increase the slow hydrogenation rates observed in the bulk and, ultimately, be able to lower the temperature required for hydrogenation of these materials.   This research results in recruiting and retaining a talented, diverse group of students."

Specifically in this project, Professor Chen works closely with his students to 1) further develop theory and software for spectral interpretation; 2) demonstrate the study of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as the sample molecule using this technique; 3) combine the new spectroscopic technique with a high resolution, coherent, two dimensional spectroscopic method to improve the speed of data collection and information extraction; and 4) identify other interesting molecules that could benefit from the enhanced capability of this technique.

With this project, he provides them with a stimulating undergraduate research experience that encourages and better prepares them to pursue graduate school.  <br/><br/>High resolution molecular spectroscopy is a mature technique with a long record of providing detailed information about molecular structure and behavior.  However, many molecules have stubbornly resisted analysis because the spectra they produce are too heavily congested, perturbed, complex, and patternless.  Furthermore, analytical applications of high resolution molecular spectroscopy are limited by difficulty in interpreting spectra when the sample is a mixture.  The purpose of the project is to develop and explore the capabilities of High Resolution Coherent Three Dimensional (HRC3D) spectroscopy as a method for overcoming these limitations.  In conjunction with a recently developed High Resolution Coherent Two Dimensional (HRC2D) technique, which has complimentary capabilities, these two tools provide an alternative method for studying polyatomic molecules (such as NO2) in systems that cannot be studied using existing methods."

Chemical solutions are ubiquitous in natural and man-made systems, and their behavior is critical to many applications in technology, including healthcare, energy storage, environmental preservation, and food and consumer products. One approach to the description of chemical solutions is via a hierarchy of solute interactions, considering first the solute molecules individually, then taken in pairs, then groups of three, four, and so on. Each level in this hierarchy introduces new information about the mixture, such that one can infer the full behavior by proper analysis of these interactions.

However, the means to perform these calculations for practical purposes have not been developed, so the full potential of the overall approach is relatively untested.

Surfactin is known to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activity, but surfactin has also been implicated in cell-signaling activities during biofilm formation.  This project will identify the differences in the mode of action by surfactin during these different activities.  The structural sensitivity offered by 2D IR spectroscopy will be utilized to quantify the molecular details of the surfactin-lipid interaction during the surfactin insertion and lipid membrane disruption processes.<br/><br/>Pore-forming toxins are proteins that are synthesized by many organisms, including the human immune system.  These proteins insert into cell membranes in order to allow small molecules to move into cells, cause cell leakage, or to disrupt the integrity of cells such that cell death occurs.  In this work, advanced optical spectroscopy techniques will be used to monitor the protein-lipid interaction with structural sensitivity.  The results from these investigations will lead to a new understanding of how a small pore-forming toxin, surfactin, self-assembles and interacts with lipids in order to drive cell signaling processes and the disruption of lipid membranes.

They are responsible for a variety of vital cellular functions, such as: transport, signaling, adhesion, development, and many regulatory processes. This research project examines the factors that lead to transmembrane stability and the function of specific membrane proteins.  Professors Senes and Hoskins design courses that offer an introduction to bioinformatics, including a variety of topics in biochemistry (genomics, proteomics, systems biology, structure/prediction) and computational methods (and hand-on experience).

The name GASright originates from the right-handed crossing angle between the helices (near -40), and from the characteristic small amino acids (Gly, Ala, Ser: GAS) at its interface, which are arranged to form GxxxG and GxxxG-like patterns (GxxxA, AxxxG, etc.).  The computational method is used to identify GASright candidates among thousands of protein sequences of transmembrane helices for high-throughput experimental analysis. The resulting data produces a quantitative model of GASright association energetics, which is then tested in vitro on a small set of selected proteins.

Wicht at Suffolk University and Dr. Daniel P. Dowling at UMass-Boston to research proteins involved in extracting sulfur from naturally occurring organic molecules. The cycling of sulfur-containing substances is important to understanding how living organisms (including humans) play a role in moving this specific element between earth's water, atmosphere, and land components. The interconversions of compounds containing carbon-sulfur bonds and sulfur-oxygen bonds are observed across a range of microorganisms, but the order in which the chemistry proceeds only recently was discovered. Therefore, these chemical transformations remain largely unexplored. This research entails a collaborative effort by Dr. Wicht and Dr. Dowling to perform fundamental biochemical analyses and obtain structural information for how these events take place. Research assistants at the undergraduate and graduate level gain experience with enzymology, biochemistry, and protein crystallography. Additionally, participants engage in outreach activities with middle school students and receive specific feedback on lifelong learning skills important to the production of a modern STEM workforce. Strong scientific mentorship provided by PI Wicht and co-PI Dowling contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. <br/> <br/>The recently reported bacterial sulfur assimilation pathway from naturally occurring dimethylsulfone to inorganic sulfite is the central focus of the work. There are three monooxygenases involved in the biochemical reactions: SfnG (for sulfone utilization), MsuC (for methanesulfinate utilization), and MsuD (for methanesulfonate ultilization). All three enzymes are reduced flavin dependent monooxygenases that require three substrates: an organosulfur molecule, O2, and FMNH2. The kinetic landscape of the novel biochemical pathway from dimethylsulfone to sulfite is unknown, therefore the immediate goal of the proposed research activities is the determination of the apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for each protein in the pathway using visible spectroscopy. The kinetic analyses of purified recombinant enzymes are coupled with substrate specificity data determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. For each monooxygenase, a maximum rate of enzyme turnover and the specificity constant for the preferred organosulfur substrate is defined. High-resolution X-ray crystallography is used to determine the molecular details of enzyme active site(s) and reaction chemistry. Together, the experimental results are used to formulate a proposed overall enzyme mechanism consistent with the cleavage of two C-S bonds and the formation of one S-O bond. Mapping the active site environment of these enzymes guides future mechanistic studies by identifying important amino acid residues involved in bond-making and bond-breaking to sulfur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cell cycle is critical to the replication and division of a cell. It governs cellular proliferation and development---the basis of life. This project is utilizing a unique combination of approaches to understand the origin and driving forces of the cell cycle. Key genes and regulators of the cell cycle process, critical to guaranteeing normal cellular function, are  identified through computational analysis, for comparison with experimental data. Professor Wang's work may lead to a new understanding of the biological functions of the cell, with implications for the maintenance of normal cell function, critical to human health and prevention of disease. A new teaching module, based on research from the project, is integrated into the departmental systems biology course.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research is providing opportunities for training students from different backgrounds in a mutual learning, collaborative environment, preparing them to tackle problems at the nexus of these fields.<br/><br/>The study of the cell cycle is essential to understanding the life of a single cell, the basic unit of living systems. The global dynamical theory that Professor Wang and his group are developing models the underlying gene regulatory network of the cell as a chemical reaction network, with gene expression levels playing the role of chemical state concentrations. The driving forces for transitions between gene expression states originate in a combination of a nonequilibrium effective potential determined by the steady state probability and the rotational steady state flux between states of the system. The steady state probability flux quantifies the extent of nonequilibriumness and irreversible behavior, and provides the bridge for describing the thermodynamics of the system in terms of its dynamics. The project is investigating the development of a dynamical systems model of the cell cycle in terms of the gene regulatory network.  Researchers are also developing a nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory of the cell cycle in terms of energy input, energy cost, and entropy production.  The team also couples the dynamical systems and nonequilibrium dynamics models to enable predictions of biological observables such as cell cycle speed, coherence, with utilization of sensitivity analysis to identify key genes and regulators. Model predictions are being compared against time-dependent in vivo fluorescence measurements of gene expression dynamics and correlations from experimental collaborator Jie Xiao. The nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamic theory is general and can be applied to cell cycle processes in different organisms and associated underlying regulatory networks. This project is enabling a deeper, quantitative understanding of the cell cycle, with applications to normal function maintenance and disease prevention.

This joint experiment/computation project expands the scope of inelastic and reactive collisions of atoms and molecules on IL surfaces, with aims to (1) extend the use of reactive atoms as analytical probes of liquid surface structure, (2) quantify the factors that influence the connection between reagent gases and supported IL-phase (SILP) catalysts, and (3) uncover the mechanisms by which an ionic liquid surface may control the reaction of two reagent molecules. Outreach is actively promoted through the creation of a new Interactive Scattering Dynamics (ISD) web app, which is employing a graphical user interface to visualize atom-surface scattering processes through preloaded lessons and through user directed experimentation.

This is why low cost and efficient solar water splitting is one of the grand scientific challenges. One way to split water with sunlight is with a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), but these devices are not yet efficient enough for practical use. This project examines methods of optimizing parts of the PEC: the catalyst and protection layers that are key components for efficient and sustainable solar water splitting. It also examines the semiconductor electrodes that harvest solar energy, then generate and transport the electrical charge used for hydrogen generation. The overall performance of a PEC is affected not only by the bulk properties of these individual parts, but also by the interfaces formed between them. However, the difficulty of studying the interfaces relevant to water splitting have stood in the way of their study. In this project, Dr. Kyoung-Shin Choi of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and Dr. Giulia Galli of the University of Chicago combine experimental and computational studies to understand and control interfacial properties of a representative PEC system - bismuth vanadate-based photoanodes and their interfaces with other metal oxides. This project makes it possible to devise general strategies to construct optimal interfaces between the different parts of a PEC to enhance solar water splitting. Dr. Choi and Dr. Galli are also setting up combined experimental-computational tutorials to teach researchers in the field how to best compare computational and experimental results. Finally, they are creating and maintaining a website that contains useful data on PECs that can be accessed and used by researchers worldwide.<br/><br/>In a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), in addition to semiconductor electrodes that harvest solar energy and generate/transport charge carriers, catalyst and protection layers are key components for efficient and sustainable solar water splitting.  The overall performance of multicomponent photoelectrodes is affected not only by the bulk properties of the individual constituents but also by the interfaces formed between them. The characteristics of these interfaces can considerably affect the charge transport properties and recombination loss, thus determining the number of charge carriers reaching the electrode surface to participate in water splitting reactions. To date, systematic studies of the atomic and electronic structures of interfaces relevant to water splitting have been extremely rare, due to numerous experimental and computational challenges. In this project, Dr. Choi and Dr. Galli are establishing a general and fundamental understanding of the effect of interfacial atomic and electronic structures on photoelectrochemical properties by combining experimental and computational studies. In order to elucidate interface-photoelectrochemical property relationships, BiVO4-based photoanodes are used as a representative multicomponent photoelectrode system, and a series of semiconductor/oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), semiconductor/protection layer, and protection layer/OEC interfaces are constructed and examined by using single crystal and polycrystal BiVO4 electrodes with systematically varied surface terminations.  An atomic level understanding of interface-photoelectrochemical property relationships makes it possible to devise general strategies to construct optimal interfaces among photon absorbers, protective materials, and catalysts to enhance solar water splitting.

But biomolecules are relatively fragile which limits their utility, and there is a need for synthetic mimics that can capture specific targets, such as colored dyes, with high affinity and selectivity.  The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and NanochemistryProgram supports Professor Bradley Smith of the University of Notre Dame to synthesize and study cylinder-shaped molecules that capture dyes on the surface of small beads. The dye coated beads can be easily detected using a cheap camera or even the naked eye.  They are potentially useful in environmental and biomedical applications.  The research activities provide rigorous student training in chemical synthesis and data analysis, as well as extensive experience in oral and written presentations. As part of a pedagogical project, Professor Smith and his students are upgrading the free internet workbook Organic Structure Elucidation by including a series of video answers to the problems. Free and unrestricted access to the video answers helps students who lack access to advanced educational resources or experienced instructors.<br/><br/>The project builds on a recent discovery that water soluble squaraine dyes with appended polyethylene glycol chains can be threaded with extremely high affinity by a water soluble tetralactam macrocycle containing anthracene side-walls. The term Synthavidin (synthetic avidin) is the generic name for this host/guest association system. The research develops the underlying synthetic and supramolecular chemistry to produce strong and rapid capture of highly fluorescent squaraine dyes in water, and complexation-induced changes in absorption and fluorescence properties. The work produces molecular design concepts that guide supramolecular researchers towards high affinity receptors for operation in water. The bead capture assay is endowed with two powerful attributes, namely, the capability to remove enzyme cleaved fluorescent dye from turbid media and the creation of amplified signal due to self-assembly of a hyperbranched fluorescent shell around the bead. The assay design is generalizable and can be expanded to include many types of cleavage enzymes."

The practical development of these devices faces significant challenges in design, arising from incomplete knowledge of the complicated systems involved. Professor Sension will use ultrafast spectroscopy to study the fundamental chemistry and physics of molecular processes relevant to molecular switches based on photochemical ring-opening reactions, molecular motors, based on isomerization around a central bond, and vitamin B12 analogues capable of photoactivated drug delivery. Methods will also be developed to use the wavelength, energy, phase, beam profile, polarization, and temporal structure of laser pulses intelligently to manipulate molecular constituents of potential devices.  Students engaged in this research will receive training in modern experimental physical chemistry techniques, working on research problems relevant to biological processes, as well as nanotechnology and engineering.<br/> <br/>One of the most important reactions is the electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of substituted cyclohexadiene active in many molecular switches.

Although natural gas is widely used for heating and to generate electricity, it is not typically employed as a transportation fuel. This is because methane (the major component of natural gas) is a gas that cannot be turned into a liquid at room temperature using pressure. Converting methane into a compound that is liquid at room temperature, such as a larger hydrocarbon (e.g., octanes) or methanol, will make it much more useful as a transportation fuel.  Professor Metz is also helping to introduce eighth-grade girls to research in STEM fields through the Eureka! program.

Interaction of the methane or ammonia ligand with the metal weakens the carbon (C)-hydrogen (H) or nitrogen (N)-H bonds in the ligand, and this weakening is key to the subsequent catalytic activation of these bonds. The experiments measure bond weakening and polarization by the metal, as they lead to red shifts in vibrational frequencies and enhanced IR absorption. Vibrational spectroscopy also reveals the identity of reaction intermediates and products in cases where multiple isomers could be involved, as in sequential methane activation. By studying different metals and clusters with differing numbers of metal atoms, these studies elucidate the structural and electronic factors that lead to size-dependent reactivity. Complementary velocity map imaging studies study ion dissociation dynamics following electronic excitation, measuring accurate bond strengths and probing the couplings between excited electronic states.

However, a number of chemical reactions are required to transform these waste materials into something useful.  Among the most challenging chemical changes needed are reactions that remove excess oxygen atoms from the waste material.  Our team designs catalysts, materials that aid in a reaction by improving speed, selectivity and/or energy requirements, but do not themselves become consumed in the reaction.  We are actively developing, characterizing and testing catalysts that use hydrogen gas to remove excess oxygen from oils made from these waste streams.  Our team combines expertise in making catalysts and controlling their structure at the molecular level, identifying the type of reaction products that result, optimizing the reactor process for greater efficiency, and theoretical modeling to understanding the behavior of solid catalysts and the reactions they control. Together, we are able to design and study a wide range of catalysts selected to test specific ideas about how optimal catalysts for this reaction work and also to lead us towards the design of better and more environmentally friendly catalysts that use earth-abundant metals. Broader impacts of the research include environmental benefits of eliminating waste and economic benefits of producing a chemical fuel and feedstock source from waste products. All members of our team are committed to diversifying the scientific workforce and are engaged in activities to recruit and retain in our laboratories members of groups historically underrepresented in scientific fields.  We engage in active curriculum reform, and cases drawn from current scientific efforts to improve the sustainability of energy production form the foundation of the newly redesigned General Chemistry course at Barnard College, an all-women's college in New York City.<br/><br/>In this research program, Drs. Austin, Frederick, Grabow, and Schwartz are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program at NSF to test the hypothesis that catalytic materials suitable for highly selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions that cleave C-O bonds require: (1) a metal that can adsorb and split H2; and (2) an amphoteric support that can serve as a proton shuttle from the metal to the substrate to weaken the C-O bond.  If confirmed, the results from this work could alter the current paradigm invoking support reducibility rather than its amphoteric character.  A series of supported metal catalysts is being synthesized and characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods.  These catalysts are used to catalyze HDO reactions of phenol-derived model compounds, including some isotopically-labeled substrates, with hydrogen gas.  The products of the HDO reactions are analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurments. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate reaction energy profiles, which are then compared to experimental data to propose detailed catalytic reaction mechanisms.  Broader impacts of the research include environmental benefits of eliminating waste and economic benefits of producing a chemical fuel and feedstock source from waste products. Student exchange between four very different labs: a computational lab at the University of Houston, a chemical engineering lab and a physical chemistry lab both at the University of Maine, and an inorganic catalysis lab at an all women's liberal arts college in New York City, will facilitate the broad development of students working on this project.  Significant curriculum development, using cases from this work and from other research on sustainable energy development, forms the basis of a problem-based general chemistry course that serves approximately 150 female Barnard College students each year."

While 3D printing at the macro- and micro-scale is relatively mature, achieving nanometer feature size and precision is still a challenge.  To address this, the project tackles two fundamental issues: (a) how to deliver ultra-small amounts of material; and (b) how to deliver the materials to the designed location with nanometer precision.  The project advances a new approach with novel chemistry concepts for the assembly of molecules into 3D nanostructures by design.  This approach may bring us closer to achieving controlled physical and chemical properties by controlling how the molecules are put together.  This project broadens the application of 3D printing in diverse fields, such as in nanotechnology, nanodevices and sensors, tissue engineering, and in biochemistry and biomedical research.  It also boosts the capability of additive manufacturing down to the nanometer scale and consequently enhances the competitive edge of the United States 3D printing industry.  Graduate students are trained in research methods at the forefront of nanotechnology and additive manufacturing.  Professor Liu continues her long-term collaborations with local community colleges and her international education and outreach activities.  The outreach activities include summer research opportunities and seminars to stimulate the interest of a diverse group of students in advanced chemistry education and to increase awareness of 3D printing and its societal benefits.<br/><br/>The project focuses on controlling the assembly of polymer molecules by direct writing of solutions containing designated components.  To achieve molecular level control, a state-of-the-art atomic force microscope is interfaced with a nanofluidic delivery system.  The former is an existing technology for high-resolution imaging with nanometer precision, and the latter can be considered as an ultra-small needle (opening as small as 30 nm).  The research team has recently improved the delivery of femtoliter droplets, and prior work and preliminary data have demonstrated the feasibility of assembly at the microscale level.  The project builds on this foundation.  The aim is to reduce the droplet size down to the sub-attoliter level.  Towards this end, contact time, pressure and the hydrophobicity of surfaces are modified to weaken inter-molecular and molecule-surface interactions and consequently enhance the kinetics of the assembly process.  Long-term collaborations with local community colleges continue with the designed research project, summer research program, seminar and educational activities.  These activities attract a more diverse population of students into advanced chemistry education. International research and education activities keep the team well informed and updated in the field of atomic force microscopy and<br/>3D printing research and development efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reduction in size of magnetic particles over the past several decades has led to significant increase in the storage capacity but the limit is being reached.  Professor Dunbar's group at Texas A&M University Main Campus explores new types of chemical structures that display magnetic behavior at the nanoscale level.  Through systematic investigation of the structure-property relationships of these magnetic compounds, the team aims to gain a better fundamental understanding of the factors that contribute to superior magnetic properties and provide insight to inform design of the next generation magnets for computing or electronic storage devices.  The versatility of skills required to work on this project is an excellent opportunity for students, including members of underrepresented groups, to learn chemical synthesis as well as numerous methods of characterization. <br/><br/>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports Prof. Dunbar's group to synthesize and study the properties of multinuclear transition and lanthanide metal supramolecular architectures with neutral and radical bridging ligands.  Whereas more commonly used closed-shell (diamagnetic) bridging ligands engage in superexchange (indirect) interactions between the metal spins, radical bridging ligands facilitate direct exchange interactions which results in much stronger magnetic coupling.  For transition metal complexes, this situation results in modest coupling and in lanthanide complexes these interactions are very weak. Magnetic coupling in both transition metal complexes and lanthanide rare earth complexes is greatly improved by using a radical bridging ligand that can engage in direct exchange with the metal ions.  In order to further improve upon these systems, the Dunbar group seeks to generate new classes of radical-bridged magnetic complexes using supramolecular strategies.  This project focuses on using N-heterocyclic neutral ligands that feature interactions between anions and electron deficient aromatic rings, namely the anion-pi interaction.  The neutral ligand can undergo a reversible one-electron reduction at accessible potentials to form a stable radical.   Computatonal studies are performed to identify the most synthetically feasible targets and guide the direction of research as it progresses.  Spontaneous self-assembly of paramagnetic metal ions with the ligands gives multinuclear supramolecular complexes in high yields due to anion and solvent templates.  A plethora of techniques (including single-crystal X-ray crystallography, SQUID magnetometry, electrochemistry, and electron paramagnetic resonance) is used to study the rich electronic, redox, and magnetic properties of these supramolecular architectures.  By comparing the properties of the complexes with a variety of ligands with different electron donating ability and coordinating geometry, this research aims to unveil the structural and electronic factors that contribute to superior magnetic coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of light energy to do chemistry in solar energy conversion, photosynthesis, vision and even the stability of human DNA against ultraviolet radiation all involve what scientists call electronically nonadiabatic processes, nonadiabaticity for short. Such processes involve the intersection of two different potential energy surfaces representing different electronic states.  They are essentially quantum mechanical.  While existing computational tools allow the description of nonadiabatic processes for smaller chemical systems, methods for treating larger, more complex systems with highly accurate theoretical approaches are still lacking.  Yarkony and his coworkers are implementing techniques designed to extend the range of accurate descriptions to larger, more complex systems.  These techniques and their products, are freely available to the scientific community.  Perhaps ultimately even more significant than these immediate benefits, the proposed work   has the potential to transform the way chemical physicists think about nonadiabaticity and compute its effects. Yarkony has introduced a reformulation of the mathematical description of nonadiabaticity by exploiting a seminal notion introduced almost 40 years ago, with the scientifically apt, but otherwise arcane appellation, the Molecular Aharonov Bohm effect.   These more precise studies of nonadiabatic dynamics leading to photo-stability impact the broader societal goal of understanding societally relevant processes, such as how DNA protects itself against radiation damage. <br/><br/><br/>The project has three goals: (a) to develop a generally applicable procedure to incorporate the geometric phase into the single state Hamiltonian governing adiabatic dynamics enabling determination of the prevalence and magnitude of the Molecular Aharonov Bohm effect, the effect of the geometric phase attributable to energetically inaccessible conical intersections on single state nuclear dynamics; (b) to construct from an existing algorithm and new tools, a general program for determining diabatic representations for multi-state systems which incorporates in a general manner properties based diabatizations within a framework which explicitly incorporates derivative couplings and tests for spurious (also termed diabolical)  singularities that can invalidate the property based diabatizations; and (c) to use existing code and the program developed in (b) to construct coupled diabatic state representations from accurate electronic structure data to describe dissociative photochemistry in bio-related systems, including initially aniline and imidazole. .

Several students will have an opportunity to intern at the manufacturer's facility and industry scientists will co-supervise students towards a building miniature, field-portable ion chromatographs of low footprint and low power. The broader impacts are addressed through the development of a field deployable instrument that will be used in many applications, and through undergraduate and graduate student education and training that includes unique and extensive industrial interactions. <br/><br/>This project has two separate broad goals: While most anion analyses today are carried out by ion chromatography, the equipment is still too heavy and consumes too much power to be easily deployed in the field. This project seeks to develop a small, portable, low power consumption ion chromatograph instrument for field deployment. Rather than packed columns, a suppressed open tubular (OT) IC is envisioned where the column will contain an integral suppressor and admittance detector for fully functional gradient-capable, suppressed IC. Further, a second admittance detector will be present. Before this detector, a base will permeate through the wall and mix with the first detector effluent; this principle is known to enable detection of very weak acid anions, not presently possible. The second goal is to explore scanning detection in liquid and ion chromatography, using a variety of detectors and separation modes. Glass, silica and polymer columns are transparent to several types of detectors. A scanning platform provides an inexpensive high-resolution means to look at separations occurring inside columns as they occur. The net result is that one can look at separations in real time and, in principle, provide automated feedback to eluent composition to improve separations. The wealth of data generated during multiple scans will enable accurate quantification actually before complete separation occurs. Scanning detection visualizes what did not elute and provides a diagnostic of column health. Finally, in gradient elution, the three dimensional map of time location and speed of an analyte is expected to provide an identification marker that is intrinsically chromatographic and not detector-dependent."

In some cases, the loss of electrons means that the repulsion between the positively charged nuclei increases, and the molecule flies apart.  This phenomenon is called a ""Coulomb Explosion,"" after the physical law that describes the forces of repulsion and attraction in charged particles.  Many previous studies of Coulomb Explosion processes have involved high intensity femtosecond pulse lasers (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of second. In laser systems, the shorter the pulse, the higher the light intensity that can be achieved).  In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Wei Kong and her research group at Oregon State University are investigating Coulomb explosions that are produced with surprisingly low intensities of laser light.  They are using advanced laser techniques to explore this new phenomenon in detail, by measuring the energy and directionality of the atomic fragments from molecules and atomic clusters formed under different conditions, including the size, the chemical composition, and the effective temperature of the cluster. The Kong group is also testing a new theoretical explanation for the occurrence of Coulomb explosions induced by low intensity light.  This results from this research project have the potential to change how we think about molecular structure and the interaction of molecules with light.  In the long term, it may be possible to induce some chemical reactions with lower energy inputs than currently assumed (thus, ""big bang"" results may be touched off by a ""whimper"" of input light).  A post-doctoral fellow engaged in this project is receiving training in advanced laser techniques and theoretical chemistry.<br/><br/>This project involves measurements of the spatial and energy distributions of atomic fragments from Coulomb explosions of clusters prepared under a variety of conditions. Based on the tentative model proposed by the Kong group, Rydberg manifolds of the clusters are necessary for the initiation and heating stages of Coulomb explosions, and the generation of multiply charged atomic ions is a result of a singly (or low) charged atomic ions boiling off a highly charged cluster ion. To test the first half of the hypothesis, the chemical composition of the cluster is changed from stable organic molecules to alkali metal atoms. This change in composition significantly shifts the energy levels and density of states of the cluster. To test the second half of the hypothesis, the kinetic energy and spatial distribution of the resulting atomic ions need to be measured. Energy conservation dictates the ultimate velocity gained by the atomic ions, and spatial orientation of the fragments signifies the timing of the production of the atomic ions. Velocity map imaging techniques are being used to obtain these data.  Coulomb explosion processes are currently exploited in chemical imaging and surface nanostructure applications.  This research may lead to advances in these fields, and potentially in the realm of photochemical reaction control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work is motivated by the potential for solar energy harvesting demonstrated by perovksites. The perovskite crystals targeted in this project have two-dimensional (2D) shapes where the faces of the crystals have millimeter-scale dimensions. Such 2D perovskites absorb light in the visible range and are relatively resistant to humidity, which is desirable for harnessing solar energy.

The quantum wells targeted have garnered attention for their stabilities under humid conditions and large exciton binding energies. In addition, the research team is investigating layered systems that consist of ""stacks"" of quantum wells in which the band gap decreases with respect to height in the film. Thus, electronic excitations are funneled from the bottom to the top of the film in these layered perovskites.  The diffractive optic-based microscope employed in this research acquires transient absorption data at 41 locations on the sample surface in a single experiment. Signals are simultaneously detected at two probe wavelengths using a pair of array detectors (e.g., wavelengths corresponding to energy donor and acceptor quantum wells). In studies of exfoliated crystals, diffusivities of excitons are being measured at a number of excitation wavelengths to establish a quantitative relationship between the carrier diffusivity and excitation energy. Statistical distributions of diffusion rates are generated by analyzing the dynamics at 41 different spots on the sample.

For example, hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen in blood, whereas cytochrome plays a central role in the electron transport chain in mitochondria. This project focuses on the femtosecond time scale in which elementary nuclear motions of these systems take place. Pulsed laser techniques are uniquely equipped to resolve such fast dynamics. In addition to advancing the understanding of these particular proteins, the experimental methods developed in this project can be adapted by other researchers for applications to a much wider range of systems and processes. The graduate and undergraduate students who conduct this research develop a wide range of technical skills (e.g., optics, instrument development, machining, computer programming).<br/><br/>This project involves the development of two-dimensional resonance Raman (2DRR) spectroscopies in which five noncollinear laser beams induce light emission from a chemical system.

The background-free nature of these techniques facilitates fast data acquisition rates and enhances sensitivity to weak signals. Two-dimensional Raman spectroscopies are challenged by undesired nonlinearities known as cascades in off-resonant systems (i.e., systems that do not absorb the incoming laser beams).

Such simulations have become a powerful tool in chemistry, often providing fundamental insights into complex phenomena which are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, achieving the necessary accuracy for realistic and predictive simulations remains challenging.  Paesani and his research group are meeting this challenge by combining a variety of approaches to generate very accurate models of many systems including ions in solution.  The new methodology enables computer simulations of aqueous systems with unprecedented accuracy, providing information on fundamental molecular processes from ion hydration in bulk and at interfaces to proton transfer and transport in solution. The new methodology will be available to the community through its implementation in the open and free OpenMM software toolkit for molecular simulations.  This ""reference implementation"" aims to provide the community with a completely open computational tool which may be used by other researchers interested in implementing it in their own simulation codes. In addition, this initial implementation is a starting point for future developments of unique software elements specifically designed for high-performance computing which will enable many-body simulations with unprecedented accuracy on both multicore CPU and GPU architectures.<br/><br/>In parallel with the proposed research activities,  Paesani has established an innovative education and outreach plan focusing on the development of an entry level course that introduces undergraduate students in their freshman and sophomore years to the use of computational methods in chemistry, as well as on mentoring activities specifically designed to promote study in the STEM disciplines among students from underprivileged and traditionally underrepresented groups through the development of a summer exchange program at UC-San Diego.<br/><br/>  <br/>Both the realism and the predicting power of a computer simulation strongly depend on the accuracy with which the molecular interactions and the overall system dynamics are described. Although ab initio methods can, in principle, enable the characterization of physicochemical processes without resorting to ad hoc simplifications, the associated computational cost effectively prevents the use of these methods to model realistic condensed-phase systems. Furthermore, a rigorous description of the actual molecular dynamics often requires a quantum-mechanical treatment of the nuclear motion, which further increases the computational cost associated with ab initio computer simulations.   The methods developed by Paesani and coworkers seeks to overcome these limitations by combining machine-learning many-body potential energy surfaces derived entirely from highly-correlated electronic structure data with novel quantum-dynamical approaches based on path-integral molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics. The efficient integration of these components pushes the boundaries of current molecular dynamics techniques and provides new opportunities for realistic simulations of condensed-phase systems in direct connection with corresponding spectroscopic measurements. Although much broader in scope,  the initial application of the methodology is to modeling physicochemical processes in solution, with a specific focus on ion hydration, linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy, and proton transfer/transport. The new methodology will be made available to the community through its implementation in the C++ ""reference platform"" of the open and free OpenMM software toolkit for molecular simulations. Specifically,  implementation will consist of an independent plug-in to provide the community with a completely open implementation of these many-body potentials. This plug-in will include a complete suite of unit tests that cover all energy and force components as well as the inner functions of our many-body potentials. A number of test cases will also be made available for comparing output energies and forces obtained with OpenMM with the reference values calculated with the PI's in house implementation. To facilitate the use of the new many-body potentials, the plug-in will also offer a Python wrapper that will simplify both setting up and running many-body molecular simulations to the point where all simulation parameters will be entirely defined in an XML file. This plug-in will thus provide other researchers with a comprehensive implementation of our many-body potentials for aqueous simulations, which can be used as a reference for the implementation in other software. In addition, this reference implementation will serve as a starting point for future developments of unique software elements for the OpenMM toolkit, specifically designed for high-performance computing on both multicore CPU and GPU architectures.  The development and application of the new simulation methodology will involve the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows, who will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and computational chemistry.

The goal of this project is to utilize computer modeling to obtain a deeper understanding of structure-property relationships in such complexes, so that new chromophores, photocatalysts or photomagnetic materials may be designed. The project lies at the interface of computational, inorganic, and physical chemistry, and is therefore well positioned to introduce computational chemistry as a valuable tool to a wide range of students at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Collection of dyes in the Max A. Weaver Dye Library at North Carolina State University is used to motivate the research and educational activities of high school and undergraduate students.  The students contribute developing a set of data for the library to benchmark computational methodologies for calculations of visible absorption spectra and to screen dyes for use as chromophores in dye-sensitized solar cells.<br/><br/>The rational design of chromophores and photocatalysts based on first row transition metal complexes relies on the fundamental knowledge of how these complexes absorb and dissipate light. In particular, understanding the mechanisms of nonradiative decay processes, such as internal conversion and intersystem crossing, is key to our ability to control excited state properties of these systems. The goal of this project is to obtain a better theoretical understanding of the mechanism of nonradiative decay in first row transition metal complexes, so that a more rational approach to the development of efficient chromophores, photocatalysts, and photomagnetic materials based on earth-abundant metals can be taken. Specifically, the project focuses on structural factors that facilitate the ultrafast intersystem crossing events in iron-based complexes. The project involves computational studies on a series of octahedral as well as low coordinate iron complexes utilizing density functional theory, time-dependent density functional theory, nonadiabatic transition state theory, and nonadiabatic surface hopping dynamics.

Modern chemical and materials research increasingly relies on electronic structure calculations, i.e., solving the equations of quantum mechanics for electrons to predict or understand physical and chemical properties.   Burke's method uses very fundamental properties of quantum mechanics to derive improved approximations in a highly systematic fashion.  The intellectual value is to understand the quantum nature of electrons more deeply than before, in a way that significantly reduces errors. The impact could be significant, as it could improve electronic structure calculations for thousands of scientific papers each year, including those related to drug discovery, and to the identification of new catalysts, and new phases of matter.  There is also a broad-based educational component, as graduate, undergraduate, and high school students are involved in the research.<br/><br/>Burke and his research group combine theoretical methods from three different disciplines. A systematic non-empirical approach to density functional approximation is used, via an asymptotic expansion in powers of Planck's constant, the fundamental quantity that determines the strength of quantum effects. For model systems, the approximations can be found explicitly, and yield far more accurate results than previous formulas. For realistic systems (molecules and materials), the general forms can be used to deduce asymptotically exact approximations that significantly improve on those in use today, and constrain more sophisticated approaches. The methods are also applied to the problem of orbital-free electronic structure calculations, which holds the promise of making much larger distance and time scales accessible to density functional theory  (DFT) calculations. The work includes an alternative strategy to the  DFT framework in use today, called potential functional theory. A natural connection with thermal DFT has the potential to lead to useful applications in the time-dependent density functional theory of molecules and of warm dense matter."

However, understanding and controlling these processes is challenging because energy is generally expended quickly but stored slowly. For example, filming a speeding bullet (energy flow) poses different challenges than filming a flower growing (energy storage). In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Cody W. Schlenker of the University of Washington (UW) is using advanced laser techniques to provide fundamental understanding of how light absorption drives chemical reactions, two processes with rates as different as the velocity of a speeding bullet and the growth of a flower. The scientific knowledge gleaned from this project has the potential to improve sunlight-to-fuel conversions, solar water decontamination, and possibly even new avenues for light-driven industrial chemical production. Professor Schlenker's Research-Integrated Science Education (RISE) Program focusses on helping to equip low-income and potential first-generation college students with the tools needed to apply to college, succeed in STEM majors, and enter the STEM workforce. The group integrates research and education to develop new peer-generated science tutorials presented by students from the most ethnically and culturally diverse public high-schools in Washington State (e.g. Chief Sealth High School in Southern West Seattle through a partnership with the UW's Math & Science Upward Bound program). One example product of the RISE Program: Step-by-step, peer-led-learning video science experiments are distributed freely on a RISE-dedicated YouTube channel. The research group also leverages existing UW resources, for example, through a partnership with the UW Clean Energy Institute. Organic photochemistry may lay the conceptual groundwork for new research in the field of solar water splitting. Cheap and scalable solar hydrogen could positively impact energy and food sustainability, since ammonia fertilizer production is resource intensive.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this project is to understand the role of inter-molecular excited states in the photochemistry of hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes. This research is focused particularly on understanding how nitrogen-containing molecules known as azaarenes photochemically react by removing hydrogen atoms from water and alcohols. To achieve this goal, the research team uses spectroscopic and electrochemical signals associated with transient, photogenerated, excited-states and free radicals. The population of these species are monitored as a function of the temporal delay between an initial ultrafast visible laser pulse (pump) and a subsequent infrared pulse (push) using transient absorption, photoluminescence, and electrical current detection. This approach is notable because it has the potential to extract ultrafast time information from the relative yields of much slower chemical reactions. Azaarenes play critical roles in photosynthetic assemblies, DNA photo-protection, photo-stabilization of industrial pigments, and they are common chromophores in renewable energy research focused on proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). In these capacities, azaarenes can hydrogen-bond with hydroxyl groups. These hydrogen bonding interactions often alter the chromophore's photophysics and photochemical reactivity in seemingly unintuitive ways. The critical mechanistic links between the branching ratio among ultrafast photophysical pathways and the much slower subsequent photochemical reactions of azaarene molecules may constitute a step forward. Broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits resulting from clarifying whether inter-molecular electronic excited-states that arise from hydrogen bonding interactions serve as a chemical gateway to photon-initiated reactions. Additionally, this project provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, integrating research concepts into public engagement activities for science outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Triazabutadienes are chemically attached to protein amino acids, followed by spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed chemical changes which produce a chemical probe.

Triazabutadienes release highly reactive but chemoselective aryl diazonium ions upon protonation within a physiologically relevant range of pH. First, the triazabutadienes are structurally modified such that they can be initially conjugated to proteins. After conjugation, pH-triggered protein-bound aryl diazonium ions then offer a new way to interrogate protein-protein interactions. Enhanced reactivity which has been observed upon photochemical isomerization of the triazabutadiene expands the utility of these protein-conjugates. Second, the chemistry of triazabutadienes are coupled to cellular chemistry other than acidification. Enzymatically triggered release of triazabutadienes enhances their selective biochemical deployment. Finally, a new class of fluorogenic probes are used to report on the ligation of aryl diazonium species with electron-rich amino acid side chains containing tyrosine and histidine. The chemoselectivity and fluorescence properties of these probes are studied to establish the scope of their utility.

Harvesting even a small fraction of the sunlight striking the United States would help our country become energy independent. There are several factors which limit full utilization of sunlight to meet our energy needs. For example, sunlight is intermittent while our energy demands are nearly constant.  Also, it is difficult to use solar energy directly to meet some of our needs, such as transportation fuels. These factors motivate efforts to convert solar energy into chemical fuels, often referred to as solar fuels. Water is one of the most abundant chemicals available on Earth, and a reaction known as oxidation enables the energy of the sun to convert water into useful forms of energy (electrons and protons). Scientists currently do not fully understand the processes which control solar-powered water oxidation. In this project, Dr. Hamann is investigating the fundamental steps of water oxidation on semiconductor surfaces that absorb sunlight. Catalysts deposited on those surfaces use the absorbed solar energy to oxidize water. Dr. Hamann is also engaged in several outreach activities that leverage his research activities.  These activities engage the public and students at all levels in the scientific challenges associated with solar energy capture and conversion to useful forms of energy (like solar fuels). These activities include participation in the Michigan State University Science Festival, a series of Science Caf's focused on sustainability, the Midwestern Symposium on Undergraduate Research, and the American Chemical Society (ACS) Project SEED for economically disadvantaged high school students.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Hamann of Michigan State University (MSU) is investigating photo-induced water oxidation with metal oxide semiconductors.

A suite of electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, spectroscopic and operando measurements are being carried out to elucidate the nature and behaviour of these surface states during solar water oxidation on ternary metal oxide electrodes, including copper tungstate, CuWO4. Integration of water oxidation catalysts on semiconductor surfaces is a promising method to improve the water oxidation efficiency, however the nature of the interface that develops between semiconductor and catalyst, and its effect on the electron-transfer reactions occurring at this interface, is not well understood.  Several semiconductor/catalyst combinations are also being investigated to develop a general and detailed understanding of the role of the interface in controlling the overall water oxidation reaction. The knowledge gained from this research allows the development of efficient conversion of solar energy to high energy density chemical fuels, which is a significant benefit to society. Additional broader impacts of this research derive from Dr. Hamann's outreach and educational activities at all levels.

This base-pairing also offers a rich design space for the new engineering disciplines of molecular programming and synthetic biology. These engineering efforts are greatly assisted by the use of computational algorithms to design and analyze the base-pairing (secondary structure) properties of DNA or RNA strands before beginning more costly and time-consuming laboratory studies. Historically, the secondary structure models underlying these calculations have been parameterized based on experiments performed piecemeal over a period of decades, making it difficult to improve the models (still incomplete after 45 years of effort) or to extend the models (to new materials and experimental conditions critical to modern applications). Departing dramatically from this experimental parameterization approach, the proposed work will establish a computational parameterization framework, in which state-of-the-art computational chemistry methods with be used - for the first time - to perform atomistic simulations on a carefully chosen suite of small model problems, enabling automated parameterization of new secondary structure models from scratch. This strategy requires a high level of inter-disciplinarity beyond the capabilities of any individual research group, demanding computational and algorithmic expertise to perform modeling at both the atomistic level and the secondary structure level, and experimental expertise to test key ensemble properties predicted from new parameter sets. This effort draws together three laboratories (Miller, Pierce, Winfree) spanning three Caltech Divisions (Biology & Biological Engineering, Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, and Engineering & Applied Science) to achieve major impact on the molecular programming, synthetic biology, and life sciences research communities by dramatically improving current secondary structure models and by creating a repeatable, improvable, extensible computational framework for generating new models long into the future. Over the coming decades, the fields empowered by these advances are poised to generate transformative molecular and cellular technologies addressing challenges to science and society ranging from neuroscience and development, to diagnosis and treatment, and from renewable energy to sustainable manufacturing. <br/><br/>The programmable chemistry of nucleic acid base pairing is central to the circuits that orchestrate life and to the emerging engineering disciplines of molecular programming and synthetic biology. Existing secondary structure models have great utility for analyzing and designing functional DNA and RNA systems, but current equilibrium parameter sets are incomplete, apply to a limited set of experimental conditions, and are difficult to extend or improve as they are based on empirical parameters measured over the course of 45 years. Furthermore, essentially no kinetic parameters have been measured to date. Departing from this piecemeal experimental approach, the proposed work will parameterize equilibrium and kinetic secondary structure models - for the first time - using atomistic molecular simulations. State-of-the-art computational chemistry methods will be used to set up a forward compatible framework for parameter generation that is automated and repeatable, enabling researchers to rerun the parameterization suite from scratch to generate an entire parameter set for a new set of experimental conditions (salt, temperature, denaturant), for new synthetic analogs (LNA, 2?OMe-RNA), or for mixed-material interactions (DNA/RNA, RNA/2'OMe-RNA, RNA/LNA) that are crucial for modern in situ and in vivo applications. The computational framework will initially be validated via comparison to the subset of DNA and RNA parameters that have been most carefully measured in existing empirical models, followed by validation with respect to key equilibrium and kinetic results extracted from the experimental literature, or measured in the laboratory."

Para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) and monomethyl phosphate (MP) are first used as model molecules to perform comprehensive studies of the reaction kinetics, and the studies are then generalized to various types of phosphate ester molecules, including aryl and alkyl phosphates, nucleotides and phospholipids. The research enables the efficient recovery of phosphorus from biomass for the renewable production of phosphorus.  This phosphorus can then be used in the production of fertilizers that are necessary for economical and productive agriculture. This work gains new, fundamental knowledge about the structure-property relationships of the ceria catalysts, particularly at the nanoscale and in aqueous solution environment.  The two investigators are actively engaged in outreach programs for promotion of education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.

He is developing methods to create chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls (molecules that nature used to harvest energy from light) in the laboratory from simple starting materials in a straightforward manner. The synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls has never been fully accomplished in this manner. The ability to build such molecules along with analogues will afford a much deeper understanding of energy flow in photosynthesis (an area that impacts biophysics, plant sciences, energy generation), the nature of metabolic breakdown products (an area that impacts ecology, global carbon balance), and the chemical properties of such compounds (an area that impacts nutrition, medicine).  The project mainly involves organic chemistry but will also impact diverse areas of science including understanding of photosynthesis. Thus, the project is well suited for the education and training of scientists in a collaborative environment.  Professor Lindsey's group is well-positioned to provide this experience for students underrepresented in science.  In addition, outreach activities involving North Carolina teachers will also be part of the funded project.  <br/><br/><br/>Chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are the chief pigments in photosynthetic organisms, including plants, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.

The Lindsey lab proposes to fill this chasm by developing robust methods for synthesis of such valuable macrocycles.  The particular challenges in synthesizing (bacterio)chlorophylls include (1) the stereochemistry of substituents in the pyrroline ring(s), (2) the fifth (isocyclic) ring, and (3) substituents arrayed about the perimeter of the macrocycle. The intellectual merit of the work concerns the development of routes for the synthesis of the key photosynthetic pigments and analogues; the latter have broad impact (beyond the scope of the present grant) encompassing studies of quantum coherence in photosynthesis and catabolism in ecology.  A key outcome is a methodology in heterocyclic chemistry for preparing pyrroles, pyrrolines, dipyrromethanes, hydrodipyrrins, and phyllobilins relevant to the (bacterio)chlorophylls of photosynthesis.  The broader impacts entail professional development of middle and high school science teachers to improve teaching of photosynthesis (via a chlorophyll-based experiment) in schools and to inspire middle and high school students to STEM, thereby broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond the appeal of symmetric forms, symmetry can also impart function. For example, orb spiders weave in a spiral pattern to maximize the strength of their webs and bees construct honeycombs with close packed hexagons to maximize honey storage. This correlation between structure and function is also captured in modern nanomaterial design, where changing the symmetry of a nanocrystal or the internal order of a superstructure built from nanocrystals can give novel function. However, the synthesis and assembly of nanomaterials have been limited to simple compositions and structures until recently. In this research, the principal investigator, Sara Skrabalak, is developing new synthetic methods to make metal nanostructures with multiple metals and defined shapes. These nanostructures are also being used as building blocks to form larger structures, where the symmetries of the building blocks direct the shapes of the larger superstructures. The principal investigator and her students also study how the compositions and structures impart functionality. In particular, studies into the new light-matter interactions that arise as a function of symmetry are underway in an effort to achieve multi-functional platforms for chemical sensing applications. Ultimately, this research has broader impacts in the field by forging links between multiple disciplines, including nano/inorganic/solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, surface science, and material science. This project also incorporates outreach and educational efforts that introduce nanoscale concepts to non-scientists.  The project also involves undergraduates in research activities in ways that emphasize their connection to the surrounding community.<br/><br/>The Skrabalak group at Indiana University is developing seed-mediated co-reduction as a new synthetic strategy to multimetallic nanostructures, where multiple metals are simultaneously deposited onto shape-controlled nanocrystals.  The symmetry of the nanocrystal seeds is transferred to the final nanostructures. This research includes studying how lattice mismatch and deposition kinetics contribute to bimetallic distribution. This work is coupled with a study of how symmetry can be reduced along specific crystallographic directions during seed-mediated co-reduction in order to achieve new stellated nanocrystal symmetries and in turn functional diversification. Finally, the Skrabalak group is using the stellated metal nanocrystals to assemble close-packed and low-density lattices to expand crystallization capabilities to new structural classes.  They also characterize the collective optical properties that emerge. These three aims are coupled with outreach and educational efforts in which undergraduate researchers are Science Ambassadors to their former high schools, introducing nanoscale concepts to students and serving as role models to those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Advancement in the research expands the classes of nanocrystals and superstructures possible and identifies the roles of seed and building block symmetry in the synthesis and assembly of metal nanocrystals for broader impact in the science."

The chemical insight gained from molecular and mechanistic studies of nano-bio interactions is used to intentionally design nanomaterials that provide the desired technical functions while also minimizing potentially adverse consequences with the environment. CSN research leads to introduction of a new generation of safer nanomaterials that may impact multiple sectors of the economy including energy, transportation, electronics, food, and agriculture. The CSN prepares a new generation of scientific innovators by providing education and professional development opportunities focused on innovation, communication, leadership, and interdisciplinary scientific skills. CSN researchers actively encourage diversity within chemistry through CSN-run workshops on overcoming implicit bias, recruitment of graduate students and postdocs, and Center-sponsored research experiences for students and faculty from underrepresented groups as well as veteran undergraduates. CSN researchers encourage diversity in public engagement, develops and practices informal communication skills, and expands the highly successful sustainable-nano.com blog to include Spanish language content, K-12 activity materials, podcasts, and videos.<br/><br/>CSN integrates experiments with computation in three integrated research focus areas (RFAs). RFA1 develops new materials with precisely controlled structure and properties, molecular-level characterization tools such as advanced non-linear optical methods and sub-diffraction imaging, and novel computational methods spanning length scales from nanometers to millimeters. RFA2 uses the RFA1 tool kit to understand, control, and predict how nanomaterials attach to, penetrate, and alter cell surfaces using lipid bilayers as model systems for cell membranes. RFA3 determines the molecular processes by which pristine and environmentally transformed nanomaterials interact with living systems with diverse cellular chemistries, ranging from single cell to multi-cellular organisms. The integration of these three RFAs enables the Center to establish how nanomaterial properties and behavior impact biological outcomes. This knowledge leads to reliable predictions of biological responses to existing and future nanomaterials and guides the design and synthesis of safe, sustainable nanomaterials.

In particular, CCE seeks to uncover how proto-biopolymers, i.e. the earliest polymers of life, could have spontaneously formed and initiated functional evolution. The work of the Center is divided into four research themes: 1) Proto-Nucleic Acids, 2) Proto-Polypeptides, 3) Proto-Polysaccharides, 4) Building Blocks and Alternative Environments. CCE aims to impact society by identifying the molecules and processes necessary for the formation of polymers with the ability to evolve function. Continued progress towards this goal will provide new methods for the design, development, and characterization of novel polymers, such as smart materials and therapeutic agents, which could result in economic impacts and improvement of the human condition. Enhancing the education and career development of students and young scientists involved with the Center and making positive impacts on the public's perception of chemistry are additional broad impacts to be realized through CCE educational efforts. In particular, CCE will develop a fully integrated research and educational program which includes a professional development seminar series, an annual symposium, and a highly interactive mentoring culture that fosters the development of students and postdocs into independent, interdisciplinary innovators and educators. CCE has also identified unique educational and public venues to work with children and young people to educate and excite them about chemistry. CCE will continue to work with artists to produce chemistry-relevant content for visual displays, short video animations, radio pieces to be aired on national public radio, and interactive performances to engage audiences of all ages and educational levels. CCE also plans to continue its recruiting efforts to underrepresented minority groups by collaborating with HBCUs, sponsoring research symposia at national diversity conferences, such as NOBCChE and SACNAS, and partnering with student organizations on full-day STEM events.<br/><br/>The unifying scientific objective of CCE is to demonstrate that small molecules, within a model prebiotic environment, can self-assemble into polymers resembling extant biopolymers and undergo functional evolution. The four research themes of the CCE are: 1) Proto-nucleic acids - studying proto-nucleic acids that are ""forward compatible"" where sequence information can be maintained and transferred through gradual evolution to contemporary RNA; 2) Proto-polypeptides - exploring polyesters as possible precursors of polypeptides during prebiotic peptide synthesis; 3) Proto-polysaccharides - studying polysaccharide synthesis under plausible prebiotic conditions; and 4) Building Blocks and Alternative Environments - identifying plausible prebiotic reactions, mineral sources, mineral catalysts, and alternative milieus for other proto-biopolymer synthesis.  Progress on these research themes is expected to lead to the discovery of molecules, reactions, and polymers with unique properties - properties that could find a variety of innovative applications in the areas of organic, polymer, supramolecular, and biomimetic chemistry. Defining the contents of a model prebiotic chemical inventory also leads to the development of new tools and approaches for dealing with complex chemical mixtures that are readily transferable to many other areas of pure and applied chemistry.  Ultimately understanding the origin of biopolymers could represent a fundamental advance in our understanding of the chemical origins of life."

Multiscale systems describe chemical and physical processes that occur on many different time and spatial scales, for example, both very fast and very slow motions may contribute to the overall process.  In both the computer processing of videos and the modeling of multiscale chemical systems, reducing complexity via removing extraneous details is essential. Without removing some model details, simulating multiscale processes like DNA transcription or the peptide aggregation which leads to plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease is impossible. Current approaches to reduce the number of atoms in a model rely on intuition and tradition due to the near infinite ways in which atoms can be removed or combined. White, Xu and their research groups are developing a novel approach built upon advances in video segmentation. Video segmentation is the process of identifying foreground, background, and objects in a video. Surprisingly, the same mathematical structure can be applied to chemical systems and that is the goal of this research. White, Xu and their collaborators will introduce the research to a broader audience via an augmented-reality laboratory for students. Students will be able to decide how to simplify molecular models and see the results by combining the visual experience of augmented-reality with the interactivity of molecular simulations. <br/><br/>Coarse-graining (CG) is the dimension reduction technique used to simulate multiscale systems more efficiently. There is not a rigorous theory for generating mappings from all-atom (fine-grain) system to the CG system. This missing component is essential because past CG work shows that many mappings lead to homogeneous, weakly interacting, gas-like CG models but the number of possible mappings is combinatorial with respect to the number of atoms. Andrew White and his collaborators are working to solve this mapping problem by (i) developing a theory to represent mapping algorithms based on video segmentation algorithms; (ii) creating a database of mappings and their performance on benchmark simulations to foster community involvement; (iii) studying and testing these methods on multi-protein surface interactions, where current mapping approaches struggle. Achieving success here, along with recent advances in calculating CG potentials, will better advance the community's ability to model complex multiscale phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Lalic is developing a new type of reactions for organic synthesis. The goal of this research is to provide a more efficient alternative to traditional methods for making molecules by the coupling of two or more molecular fragments (reactions referred to as cross-coupling reactions). Cross-coupling reactions improve the efficiency of synthetic efforts relative to building molecules one step at a time.  Cross-coupling reactions are commonly used in the preparation of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals and thus, are relevant to advanced manufacturing. The new type of cross-coupling reactions enables the use of readily available compounds as starting materials. The new reaction provides economic and environmental advantages over the existing state-of-the-art.  Dr. Lalic and his group have established an outreach program with elementary and high school schools that promote science and technology. A wide range of activities, including regular participation in science classes at local high schools, are designed to reach students underrepresented in science and promote careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines.<br/><br/>In this project, two types of reductive cross-coupling reactions of unsaturated compounds are being developed. Syn-selective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes are being used to enable the hydroarylation, hydroalkenylation, and hydroalkylation of alkynes. All three transformations involve hydrocupration of alkynes followed by palladium-catalyzed functionalization of the alkenyl copper intermediate. The key for the cooperative action of copper and palladium catalysts is a phase-separation of two incompatible components; one from a catalytic cycle of a copper catalyst and one from the catalytic cycle of a palladium catalyst. The phase separation prevents a series of side reactions that otherwise dominate the outcome of the reaction. This strategy is general and can be used to develop other processes that require cooperative catalysis of two incompatible catalytic cycles. The Lalic group is also developing methods for anti-selective hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes. These transformations are based on an initial cross coupling followed by the selective semireduction of the alkyne intermediate. Another important aspect of the work this project is the continued commitment of Professor Lalic and his group to promoting science in a broader community. A major focus of these efforts is a collaboration with local programs and institutions that specialize in supporting participation of underrepresented minority students and women in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To tackle this challenge, Dr. Chao Wang from Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Ye Xu from Louisiana State University are collaborating to explore catalytic dephosphorylation using ceria nanocrystals. By integration of advanced nanomaterial synthesis, X-ray and molecular spectroscopic characterization, catalytic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the project identifies the important ceria surface structures, such as crystal facets and defects (cerium cation (Ce3+) and oxygen vacancies), and systematically evaluates them to establish the structure-property relationships and identify the active sites. Para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) and monomethyl phosphate (MP) are first used as model molecules to perform comprehensive studies of the reaction kinetics, and the studies are then generalized to various types of phosphate ester molecules, including aryl and alkyl phosphates, nucleotides and phospholipids. The research enables the efficient recovery of phosphorus from biomass for the renewable production of phosphorus.  This phosphorus can then be used in the production of fertilizers that are necessary for economical and productive agriculture. This work gains new, fundamental knowledge about the structure-property relationships of the ceria catalysts, particularly at the nanoscale and in aqueous solution environment.  The two investigators are actively engaged in outreach programs for promotion of education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities include training graduate students with state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical skills and developing their independent research philosophy, providing undergraduate students with hands-on experiences at the cutting edge of science and engineering research, and engaging middle- and high-school students from diverse backgrounds to work in the investigators' laboratories as summer interns."

Chalifoux of the University of Nevada, Reno. Professor Chalifoux develops new chemical tools for the efficient synthesis of biologically active compounds. New methodology developed in this research focuses on the application of ynones for the efficient construction of complex cyclic compounds.  Ynones are substances in which a carbon-carbon triple bond (an alkyne) is connected to a carbon oxygen double bond (a carbonyl group).  This connection enhances chemical reactivity in bimolecular addition reactions. New strategies which are developed in this research have applications in the area of pharmaceutical synthesis and the field of medicine through the generation of biologically-relevant compound libraries. As the educational component of this project, Professor Chalifoux develops an outreach program that focuses on the mentoring of middle and high school students from low-income, first-generation college families as well as groups that are underrepresented in science. The project builds connections with middle and high schools located in the Reno, Nevada area.  Visiting high school students work closely with graduate and undergraduate chemistry students in science-related activities associated with research projects within the Chalifoux group. <br/><br/>In this project, cyclization and cycloaddition reactions of alkynes and alkynones are explored. This research develops an operationally simple synthetic methodology that converts readily available alkyne, diyne and diene starting materials into complex cyclic and polycyclic target molecules. Simple conjugated alkynes and more complex conjugated and cross-conjugated polyynes are explored as substrates for Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions. These are further elaborated in multicomponent/tandem cyclization reactions that are designed to generate multiple new carbon-carbon bonds and rings in a single reaction step, with regio- and stereochemical control. This research has broad applications in the area of pharmaceutical synthesis and the field of medicine through the rapid generation of biologically relevant compound libraries. In addition to activities at the middle and high schools, the CAREER Award supports summer research activities at the University of Nevada.

These biological nanostructures are comprised of multiple, discrete components that are assembled with nanoscale (one billionth of a meter scale) precision into a highly integrated functional system. Self-assembly offers a convenient, albeit often trial and error-based strategy, to make single-component, synthetic materials in the nanoscale regime.  However, these systems rarely exhibit the high level of performance seen in natural systems due to the difficulties in reliably designing self-assembling systems composed of multiple, precisely positioned components.  To address this challenge and progress toward higher levels of functional performance, Professors Parquette of The Ohio State University and Modarelli of The University of Akron, are developing strategies to self-assemble multiple, discrete building blocks into multicomponent architectures to serve as optoelectronic materials for solar energy conversion. Creating reliable strategies to create non-covalent architectures that rival the sophisticated systems in biology may enable new technologies capable of addressing societal problems in areas such as renewable energy, greenhouse gas conversion, and medicine. Additionally, this project is used as a platform to enhance public awareness of the potential role that science plays in addressing these issues.  The research team continues to present science exhibitions at the Columbus Center of Science and Industry (COSI) to allow younger students to experience the hands-on excitement of scientific discovery. Also, the investigators use Ohio State's REEL program to offer opportunities for large numbers of undergraduate students to perform nanotechnology research in a teaching laboratory environment in addition to providing opportunities for undergraduates in the research laboratory. Professors Parquette and Modarelli provide research experiences to minority students in the area of nanotechnology through the NSF HBCU-RISE program and through the SROP (Summer Research Opportunities Program) at OSU.<br/><br/>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professors Parquette and Modarelli, which aims to develop a versatile strategy to assemble multiple optoelectronic components into self-sorted domains that are integrated within a single nanostructure.

The morphology, dimensions, and positional arrangement of the components are correlated with the corresponding photophysical properties, measured using ultrafast spectroscopic techniques. The research activities include: (1) the co-assembly of nanotube-polymer composites displaying a coaxial, bicontinuous array of conjugated polymers that establish a redox cascade; (2) the co-assembly of discrete, monomeric building blocks into composite structures comprised of separate, self-assembled nanostructures; (3) measurement of the photophysical properties of the assemblies via ensemble and single-molecule femtosecond spectroscopy; and (4) to measure photo-electrochemical coupling of aligned nanotube co-assemblies via surface-tracked scanning electrochemical microscopy (ST-SECM).This project integrates fundamental research with outreach and communication efforts to engage a diverse group of students in interdisciplinary science, and the community at large, to show how nanotechnology impacts their lives."

The fast speeds of these reactions are measured in femtoseconds (1 femtosecond equals 0.000000000000001 second), and are studied by ultrafast laser spectroscopy.  Dr. Petek and his collaborator, Dr. Zhao, combine advanced ultrafast laser spectroscopy experiments with theoretical calculations to understand these photo-catalytic events.  In addition to the broader impacts of the research to contribute to the development of clean and efficient solar energy capture, there are substantial educational benefits for the students involved in the project. The collaborative arrangement that Dr. Petek has established with Dr. Zhao at the University of Science and Technology China and her co-worker Dr. Min Feng at Wuhan University provides excellent opportunities for students from the University of Pittsburgh to work in the Chinese laboratories, as well as for Chinese students to serve as summer interns in Dr.  Petek's laboratory.  To broaden student participation in research, Dr. Petek uses the Pittsburgh Quantum Initiative to recruit talented undergraduate students into research assistantships.  He is an ardent promotor of photocatalytic research, working to organize of international symposia on the topic as well as serving in the role of Editor-in-Chief of the journal Progress in Surface Science. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Petek and Dr. Zhao study the electron spectroscopy and dynamics related to photocatalytic processes by means of time-resolved two-photon photoemission (TR-2PP) experiments and advanced electronic structure theory.  The 2PP spectra and time resolved measurements reveal the polaronic character of electrons introduced into the conduction band of TiO2, the interaction of chemisorbed molecules with the polarons, and the unoccupied resonances of chemisorbed molecules such as CO2.  Dr. Petek conducts TR-2PP experiments on noble metal decorated TiO2 surfaces to reveal the mechanisms of plasmonically enhanced photocatalysis. In collaboration, Dr. Zhao performs electronic structure calculations to identify the electron and hole acceptor states, potentially involved in photocatalysis, for molecules adsorbed on TiO2 surface. In addition, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations are used to describe the interfacial charge transfer dynamics and carrier energy relaxation rates for chemisorbed molecular overlayers at finite temperatures. The research has broader impacts as it brings together experimentalists and theorists from the University of Pittsburgh and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) to work on the fundamental aspects of sustainable solar energy conversion via TiO2 photocatalysis. In addition to the broader impacts of the research, there are substantial educational benefits for students involved in the established collaborative project between the USTC and Wuhan University with the University of Pittsburgh, which provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student international exchange.

The complexes are studied for their ability to convert, catalytically and under mild conditions, alkanes into alkenes (i.e., compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds). Alkenes are building blocks in industry and are useful in the construction of polymers or other commodity chemicals indispensable to pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals. The research team is also investigating how to convert natural gas or volatile natural resources into liquid fuels since these are much easier to transport and store. The team is also investigating ways to convert nitrogen from our atmosphere into chemical fuels and important reagents such as ammonia or ammonium salts. This is done under mild conditions, also using well defined base metal catalysts. The catalysts that the team is synthesizing function under conditions that are milder (70-80 degree C) than cracking conditions used in the petrochemical industry (>800 degree C). Dr. Mindiola has been active with the ACS (American Chemical Society) serving as Chair of the ACS Scholars Program Subcommittee on Minority Affairs among many other activities to promote diversity in the physical sciences. He is actively involved in promoting science at the university level as well as in elementary and middle schools in the region by conducting demonstrations aimed at understanding natural resources such as nitrogen and natural gas.<br/><br/>Dr. Mindiola is investigating how base, early transition metals such as Ti, V, and Nb can promote the transfer dehydrogenation of volatile and linear hydrocarbons, selectively, into olefins and terminal olefins in the case of C4 and above. The research team is investigating mild conditions to perform such transformations by taking advantage of the reactive nature of metal-carbon multiple bonds. Through synthetic and mechanistic studies, the team is exploring optimization of conditions for higher catalytic turnover and selectivity. One particular reaction is the room temperature conversion of methane into an olefin using a well-defined Ti alkylidene or robust dinuclear systems. Dr. Mindiola is also exploring the catalytic room temperature conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia and ammonium salts using base metal niobium precursors that are simple to prepare and handle, and which have yielded intermediates that provide clues into how these systems bind, activate, and split the N-N triple bond. Dr. Mindiola is heavily involved with the American Chemical Society through committees and subcommittees aimed at promoting diversity in the physical sciences.

The new approach can evaluate the orientations and crystallinity of systems which cannot be studied with conventional tools, enabling deeper understanding of important processes in chemistry, food science, catalysis, environmental science, forensics, and biology.  The team is also generating educational materials to communicate the concepts and relevance of its research activities through a series of workshops offering hands-on and project-based activities.

This research is leading to a new class of fouling resistant surfaces that enable energy savings.  The ability to use anti-fouling membranes (i.e., filters that do not become clogged) to remove salt from sea water (desalinization) is also a potential benefit of this research.

The current research focuses on designing organic solar cell materials that absorb solar photons and efficiently generate free electrons. The long-term objectives of this research are to develop a complete toolbox of theoretical methods that can provide general, transferable design principles for materials relevant to renewable energy technology. <br/><br/>The use of mathematical tools to understand chemical reactions is central to the proposed work, and is reflected in the educational outreach component of this award. The early incorporation of mathematics significantly impacts aptitude for science in the later stages of education and is an important step towards encouraging participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers. This challenge is addressed by working with high-need school districts to develop lesson plans and demonstrations that encourage the gradual incorporation of mathematical tools in science classrooms. <br/><br/>The technical challenges addressed in this work include accurately modeling the electronic structure of large, many-atom systems and developing a computationally efficient method to incorporate quantum dynamic effects in condensed-phase charge and energy transfer processes. The electronic structure challenge is addressed with fragment-based methods where a large system calculation is divided into many accurate calculations on smaller subsystems using a high level of theory. The challenge of dynamics is to develop a method that can accurately capture quantum effects, but that is based on classical molecular dynamics where the computational effort scales well with system size. Here, this is achieved by mapping the quantum dynamics of a complex system to the classical dynamics of an isomorphic classical system derived using the path-integral representation of quantum mechanics. The methods developed here are general, and allow accurate studies of quantum behavior in complex systems with applications to many areas beyond condensed-phase photochemistry.

Fullerenes are molecules comprised of a specific number of carbon atoms (i.e., 60, 70, 84, etc.) that are widely studied for their potential technological applications, such as in electronics and solar energy conversion. The goal of this project is to develop a general method for creating specific patterns of fullerenes on flat surfaces, which will allow their technologically relevant properties to be controlled and provide a means to connect these nanometer-scale materials to conventional- scale electronics. The project provides interdisciplinary training for graduate students at the intersection of chemical synthesis, surface science, and materials science. Undergraduate students are also routinely involved in research projects in the PI's laboratory. Professor Hopkins is involved in organizing an outreach clearinghouse for doctoral students in the physical sciences at the university that will connect them with STEM-focused broader-impacts activities. <br/><br/>An impediment to the development of technological applications of fullerenes is the lack of general methods for spatially organizing them into arrays with controllable patterns and dimensions at an addressable interface. This project investigates whether 5-coordinate gallium-porphyrin monolayers on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite will template the self- assembly of fullerenes into organized arrays at the interface. Porphyrins containing axial ligands that coordinate fullerenes via noncovalent interactions (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) are synthesized, and their surface chemistry in the absence and presence of fullerenes (especially C60) are investigated via scanning-probe microscopy. These studies aim to elucidate the fundamental relationships between fullerene patterning and: 1) the electronic and structural characteristics of the axial ligands; 2) the lattice dimensions and steric properties of the underlying porphyrin monolayers; and 3) the presence of capping porphyrins that could encapsulate the particles. These relationships will allow elucidation of design principles for this class of materials. The PI also leads the continued development of an internal portal that has proven successful in connecting physical-sciences graduate students with K-12 educational outreach opportunities in surrounding neighborhoods."

This project contributes to the understanding of atoms, molecules, and molecular assemblies in the gas, liquid, and solid phases. These are the elementary components of the chemistry that underlies our understanding of materials from lasers to superconductors and on to biochemical systems. The most important equation in science, the Schrodinger Equation, is the key to new discoveries in science and engineering, areas dedicated to advances of importance to humankind. While one speaks of the Schrodinger Equation, in fact there is a different Schrodinger Equation for every different molecular system. These equations are extremely complicated for systems of broad, general interest. The practical solutions of the Schrodinger Equation require a profound mastery of both mathematics and physics to allow the derivation of important new methods. Dr. Schaefer and his research team excel in the development and application of mathematical physics, algorithm design, and computer science to achieve these goals. An important new method being developed is density cumulant functional theory. The research group also applies these new methods to the solution of important problems in the chemical sciences. Their research on manganese CO2 reduction, palladium catalysts, silicon chemistry, gallium nitride nanotubes, the CF3 substitutes SF5 and PF4, iodine clusters, and atmospheric chemistry, bears upon several areas of technological concern.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of new theoretical and computational methods for the understanding and prediction of chemical phenomena. More specifically, the Schaefer group uses electronic structure theory (quantum chemistry) to innovate, implement, and apply new methods for the description of electron correlation in molecules, one of the most challenging areas of chemical theory. A emphasis of this proposal is the development of multi-reference density cumulant theory (MRDCT). The establishment of MRDCT involves the outline of the new formalism, design of effective algorithms, careful coding of the method, and assessment through benchmarks. Applications of new and existing theoretical methods include molecular architectures; spectroscopy (microwave, infrared, electronic, Raman); potential energy surfaces; energetics; reactions via organometallic catalysts (often involving the earth abundant metal manganese); palladium catalysis for C-H bond activation and reductive elimination; examination of the biologically important class of reactions between persulfides (R1SSR2) and sulfides (R2SR4); and collaborations with experiment toward the synthesis of critically important new main group chemistry targets.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the research include the education of a significant number of gifted Ph.D. students (16 in the group currently). Professor Schaefer aggressively and successfully recruits women and underrepresented minorities for their Ph.D. studies. These doctoral students (110 graduated to date, including 23 women) almost uniformly go on to highly fruitful scientific careers in academia, government laboratories, and industry.   Schaefer's research group reaches out to local students in elementary, middle, and high schools.

To broaden chemistry education, Professor Tsarevsky is developing interdisciplinary science-humanities courses; e.g. ""Science on the Stage"" and ""Chemistry and Technology in Art: From Antiquity to the Industrial Revolution,"" exploring methods for general public science education, and developing a ""Chemistry Summer Camp"" at SMU.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Tsarevsky is studying how to use exchange reactions of ligands in hypervalent compounds of iodine, antimony, bismuth, selenium and tellurium [specifically- I(III), Sb(V), Bi(V), Se(IV), and Te(IV)] for the synthesis of dynamic covalent polymers, with controlled macromolecular architecture. The formation of these materials as well as their ability to exchange building blocks, to degrade and be re-assembled or self-repair, are being studied in detail. An important feature of the proposed dynamic polymers is that they have the potential to be converted to fixed structures with permanent links if and when needed. Professor Tsarevsky is also studying how these hypervalent compounds can be used to conver nucleophiles into radicals. The resulting functional radicals can react with a number of substrates, including polymers or plant oils and fatty acids with some unsaturation, and graphitic materials to yield various functional reactive materials and composites. To gain fundamental understanding of the factors that govern the kinetics and thermodynamics of the exchange reactions, as well as those of hypervalent bond homolysis, a number of model reactions are being conducted, in which structure and composition variables are being systematically varied."

Quantum dots are tiny semiconductors whose color depends on their size: larger particles appear redder than smaller ones. Metal nanoparticles can act as miniature antennas that channel light energy into or out of the quantum dots. This research program aims to unravel the complex interplay between nanoscale metals and semiconductors that could potentially enable technological advances such as thinner, more efficient solar cells and brighter LEDs.

Acting like local antennae, surface plasmon resonances can enable efficient coupling of electromagnetic energy into or out of a chromophore. This can manifest as increased photoluminescence intensity, which is ascribed to either increased photo-absorption, or radiative recombination. The ability of coupled surface plasmon modes to capture and concentrate electromagnetic energy presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance the role of quantum dots in light harvesting or LED applications by improving multi-exciton generation yields, increasing biexciton emission efficiencies and eliminating fluorescence blinking. Unlike previous studies, this work is primarily focused towards understanding the effects of plasmonic coupling on the photo-absorption and carrier recombination rates of multi-excited quantum dots. A combination of single particle and newly developed ensemble techniques is being used to distinguish multi-exciton fluorescence dynamics occurring in fabricated hybrid nanosystems that have been designed to enable good control over exciton-plasmon interactions. Successful completion of the proposed research tasks will (i) establish the dependence of photo-absorption and radiative recombination rates on the distance between semiconductor and metal nanoparticles; (ii) resolve effects due to changes in quantum dot size, shape and composition; and (iii) identify the differences between photo-absorption and emission enhancements induced in single exciton versus charged and multi-exciton states."

These biological nanostructures are comprised of multiple, discrete components that are assembled with nanoscale (one billionth of a meter scale) precision into a highly integrated functional system. Self-assembly offers a convenient, albeit often trial and error-based strategy, to make single-component, synthetic materials in the nanoscale regime.  However, these systems rarely exhibit the high level of performance seen in natural systems due to the difficulties in reliably designing self-assembling systems composed of multiple, precisely positioned components.  To address this challenge and progress toward higher levels of functional performance, Professors Parquette of The Ohio State University and Modarelli of The University of Akron, are developing strategies to self-assemble multiple, discrete building blocks into multicomponent architectures to serve as optoelectronic materials for solar energy conversion. Creating reliable strategies to create non-covalent architectures that rival the sophisticated systems in biology may enable new technologies capable of addressing societal problems in areas such as renewable energy, greenhouse gas conversion, and medicine. Additionally, this project is used as a platform to enhance public awareness of the potential role that science plays in addressing these issues.  The research team continues to present science exhibitions at the Columbus Center of Science and Industry (COSI) to allow younger students to experience the hands-on excitement of scientific discovery.

Direct links between this research and an on-going program at Barnard College to recruit and retain talented science students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences contribute to a college-wide effort to diversify the scientific workforce.  <br/><br/>The research in this project tests the hypothesis that metallothionein-3 (MT3), a brain specific isoform of metallothionein, tightly binds copper and that specific metallated forms of MT3 bind to actin, affecting actin polymerization. In contrast, the researchers hypothesize that when MT3 is bound to non-native metal ions like lead, it has a different structure and consequently does not facilitate the polymerization of actin.  The work also probes, using neuronal cell cultures, conditions under which MT3 expression is altered. Information from this study provides new insight into MT3 function and specifically the role that metal ions play in mediating MT3's function.

Energy (thermodynamic) costs of computational systems play a role in everything from human-engineered computers (which release heat energy equal to about 5% of the annual energy expenditure in the US) to biological systems (which must harvest enough energy from their environment to fulfill their needs to think and move). To investigate these energy costs, this project pursues three, synergistic research thrusts.  The research analyzes the fundamental energy tradeoffs faced by intracellular biochemical networks.  The project analyzes the energy tradeoffs that engineers face when designing new computer technologies.  Finally, the research integrate the energy tradeoffs of computational processes into the theory of computation. This project allows graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire the skills needed for expanding what is known about the energy requirements of computation. In addition, the workshops held under the auspices of this project are building intellectual bridges connecting the multiple scientific disciplines that involve computational systems.  Such brides are crucial to the development of a broadly applicable theory of thermodynamics of computation.<br/> <br/>This research project is undertaken to quantitatively analyze the tradeoffs relating the minimal free energy requirements and dissipation of a computer on the one hand, to several high-level properties of that computer on the other.  This analysis considers the speed of the computer; the number of hidden internal states the computer can use as buffers; the variability of the inputs to the computer and the degree and type of noise in the computer. In addition to theoretical aspects of these issues and their consequences for computation theory, this research into the thermodynamics of computation is conducted in several domains that include: chromatin computers, the computation performed during RNA folding, the computation performed by biochemical networks and post-Moore computers that exploit ""hybrid computation"" involving both quantum and classical components. It is expected that, in addition to providing major insight into the role of the thermodynamics of computation in all those domains, this project may lay the foundation for an overarching theory of thermodynamics of computation in general."

This catalytic process, referred to as water electrolysis or water-splitting, is used to produce hydrogen in an environmentally-friendly manner. Hydrogen is employed in many industries (e.g., petroleum processing) and could also be used as a fuel for transportation as well as other purposes.  Currently metal-chalcogenide (e.g., nickel and sulfur) and metal-pnictide (e.g., cobalt and phosphorous) materials show great promise as earth-abundant compounds with good catalytic properties for the water oxidation reaction (which is one of the two reactions involved in water splitting) but their true chemical compositions and structures are not well-understood.  In this project, Dr. Buddie Mullins is conducting experiments on metal-chalcogenide and metal-pnictide materials and studying their chemical and structural transformations during the water oxidation reaction.  Dr. Mullins is actively involved in scientific public awareness and promotion activities through his research that encourage the participation and intellectual development of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  These activities include laboratory internships for high school students and college undergraduates with the aim of encouraging these students (especially women and those historically underrepresented in STEM) to pursue careers in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Buddie Mullins is working to verify or disprove the hypothesis that (i) metal-chalcogenide (MC) and metal-pnictide (MP) electrocatalysts are simply precursors to highly active metal-oxide (MO) electrocatalysts and (ii) that the underlying layers of MC or MP don't influence the catalytic performance.  It is clear that the outer layers of MCs and MPs transform into MOs under water oxidation conditions.  During this transformation an amorphous high surface area film is created that is more catalytically active than its' crystalline oxide analog.  Professor Mullins is studying the mechanism by which the amorphous film is created as well as its enhanced activity.  He is also synthesizing both nanocolumnar and dense films of MCs and MPs for use as model electrocatalysts by glancing angle physical vapor deposition, which can reproducibly create electrocatalyst films. Mullins is probing the films with many different ex situ characterization techniques, including molecular beams and thermal desorption mass spectrometry for characterization and measurement of the surface area.  Dr. Mullins is actively involved in promoting science and science education to students of all ages and especially those historically underrepresented in the sciences.

He is developing new classes of reactions that that are facilitated by reversing the normal polarity and hence reactivity of molecules. Reversing the polarity means that molecules that normally behave as if they are negatively charged behave as if they are positively charged. The change facilitates the formation of a wide array of new carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-sulfur bonds that lie at the heart of chemical structures that serve many purposes in industrial, chemical, and medical applications.

These internships encourage student interest in university studies and careers in the sciences.  <br/><br/>An array of aromatic substitution reactions have been described since the seminal work of Charles Friedel and James Crafts in the mid to late 1800's.  Despite this body of work, there are still limitations in electron-rich settings; functionalization of electron-rich aromatic systems can be controlled by virtue of a temporary inversion of reactivity.  Generating and engaging highly reactive intermediates in a controlled and predictable manner by an umpolung strategy is a critical tool set in organic synthesis.  Synthetic  strategies in this regard are the manipulation of latent aromatic compounds and/or the temporary engagement of heteroatom-bound electron pairs and harnessing these energetic structures to form congested carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This award explores two reactivity manifolds available to phenols and anilines.  In the first reactivity manifold, silyl-protected phenols and anilines are converted to ortho-quinone methides (QOMs) and aza-ortho-xylylenes (AOXs).  These protected species are mixed with silyl enol ethers or silyl ketene acetals to release both the electrophilic and nucleophilic participants in conjugate addition reactions by treatment with easily dispensed and handled fluoride sources.  In the second reactivity manifold, anilines are oxidized to the corresponding N-oxides, which facilitates an array of bond formations that take advantage of the excision of the weak N-O bond.  By virtue of these mild reaction conditions, the scope and capability of umpolung reactions with electron rich aromatic rings is expanded.

Organic molecular crystals play an important role in a range of fields including chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, pharmacology, and engineering. One everyday example of organic molecular crystals are pharmaceutical tablets, which are typically formulated to optimize properties such as shelf-life (i.e. thermal stability) and solubility (i.e. dissolution upon ingestion). A perhaps less appreciated role of organic crystals has been their pivotal impact in understanding the structure and function of biomolecules (i.e. proteins) via X-ray crystallography experiments. Whereas drug molecules typically consist of only a few dozen atoms, proteins generally consist of thousands of atoms whose packing (i.e. 3-dimensional arrangement) is described by a process called ""protein folding"". A driving force behind the folding of proteins is the hydrophobic effect, which is also responsible for the commonly observed tendency of oil and water to separate. The work in Dr. Schnieder's group focuses on the rigorous incorporation of all forces that contribute to protein folding into efficient algorithms for the computational prediction of peptide and protein crystal structures (polymorphs). The approach combines advanced models of molecular interactions commonly used to predict small molecule crystal polymorphs with sophisticated molecular dynamics sampling algorithms needed to describe protein folding. The impact of this project is to expand the boundaries of the crystal structure prediction (CSP) field beyond small organic molecules (i.e. dozens of atoms) to include peptides and proteins (i.e. hundreds or thousands of atoms). Dr. Schnieder's research is fully integrated with a three-pronged strategy for educational outreach that strengthens and further diversifies training in Simulation Based Engineering & Science (SBE&S). The project's educational plan includes: outreach to underrepresented high school students to help make computational science fair projects and creation of a modern Computational Biochemistry course to train (under)graduates in applying SBE&S methods to fundamental problems in computational (bio)chemistry.  The third aim is the continued dissemination of open source Force Field X software (http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu). Leadership in SBE&S and high-performance computing (HPC) is of critical importance to the global competitiveness of the United States. <br/><br/>Physics-based protein folding via molecular dynamics (MD) inherently accounts for temperature, pressure, solvent environment and entropic contributions such as the hydrophobic effect. On the other hand, nearly all current crystal structure predication (CSP) approaches perform either a systematic or stochastic search of a potential energy surface, rather than a free energy surface, followed in limited cases by approximate inclusion of entropic considerations. The premise of this project is that a generally applicable solution to the ""protein crystal folding problem"" requires efficient inclusion of temperature, pressure and solvent environment (hydrophobic effect, pH, etc.) during polymorph discovery simulations. Due to the slow nucleation kinetics of crystallization, ordinary unbiased MD is not efficient for CSP. To overcome this, a novel family of algorithms are being developed to help open the door to polymer crystal property prediction. The first objective focuses on two novel alchemical thermodynamic paths, which do not require a priori knowledge of the crystalline state and that dramatically accelerate phase transitions 1) between vacuum and crystalline states (i.e. sublimation/deposition) and 2) between solvated and crystalline states (i.e. solubility). Both paths efficiently include the influence of temperature and pressure, while the latter path additionally includes the influence of the solvent environment. The second objective focuses on the first constant pH MD (CpHMD) algorithms for a polarizable force field (e.g. AMOEBA) to account for protonation changes as a polymer (e.g. a protein or nucleic acid) with numerous titratable residues folds and/or undergoes a crystalline phase transition. Beyond the focus of this project on protein crystals, the sampling algorithms and CpHMD theories are broadly applicable to a range of simulation applications, including protein-ligand binding, molecular design and refinement of structural models against experiment (i.e. X-ray and neutron crystallography, CryoEM, NMR, etc). The project's educational plan includes: 1) outreach to underrepresented high school students to facilitate computational science fair projects, 2) creation of a modern Computational Biochemistry course to train (under)graduates in applying SBE&S methods to fundamental problems in computational (bio)chemistry, and 3) continued dissemination of the open source Force Field X software (http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Johnson at Yale University.  Johnson is developing a new type of scientific instrument that yields precise structural information on complex molecular architectures extracted from solution.  Under this grant, he will expand the scope of the method to enable the capture and structural characterization of key reaction intermediates that underlie the mechanisms of small molecule (e.g., alkenes, H2O, H2) activation by contemporary homogeneous organometallic catalysts.  The motivation to identify these transient species is that, at present, much of the effort in catalyst design involves extensive trial and error based on overall yield, while little is often known about exactly what aspects of the chemical transformation are being affected by the various modifications.  Students and visiting faculty involved in this endeavor integrate elements of bioanalytical chemistry with atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics to create a new platform for chemical analysis. As such, this program directly interfaces physical chemistry students with immediate challenges addressed by synthetic colleagues, and consequently prepares a new generation of scientists with a versatile skill set, well centered in the chemical sciences.  An ongoing and extensive collaboration with theoretical colleague Prof. Anne McCoy at Ohio State further broadens the impact of the work by creating an interactive venue for young theorists to sharpen their skills on emergent scientific themes. Graduate students and postdocs directly involved in the project also work in close collaborations with laboratories in Germany.  This also contributes to their preparedness to perform at an increasingly competitive international level in the elite arena of basic science. Closer to home, this program integrates faculty from undergraduate institutions through summer research opportunities, and students from nearby universities without graduate programs are incorporated into ongoing work by carrying out senior research projects at Yale. Finally, this program has a longstanding tradition of opening its doors to students in the New Haven schools to illustrate how the basic science principles they are learning are in play at the foundation of the new methods under development. <br/> <br/>Cryogenic Ion Vibrational Predissociation Spectroscopy (CVIP) is a new instrumental technique which integrates mass spectrometry with high resolution infrared spectroscopy. One key feature of the approach is the implementation of cryogenic processing of the gas phase ions to effectively quench the reactive species into well-defined structures that yield sufficiently sharp features in their vibrational spectra to allow structure determination. This is carried out using vibrational predissociation spectroscopy of very weakly bound adducts attached to target ions in a custom built, radio frequency ion trap held at 5K.  In addition to its application to catalysis, the proposed work also addresses key unanswered questions regarding the critical local interactions that underlie bulk behavior of pure water as well as the layer of water molecules in direct contact with charged solutes. Because the microscopic behavior of water is central to so many fields of science, this aspect of the work is ongoing, and has impacted efforts ranging from the mechanism of vision to the remediation of heavy metals in contaminated environments."

Photochemistry may be considered one of the most powerful complexity-generating reaction classes available to chemists.  When utilizing a flow chemistry platform, it may be possible to overcome issues inherent to batch photochemical reactions, such as long reaction times, poor reproducibility, and difficult scalability. This aspect of the project explores a number of powerful photochemical reactions such as [2+2]-photocycloaddition, reactions of photoinduced phenyl cations, and photoinduced electron transfer reactions.  Electrochemical reactions are often underutilized and can be difficult to optimize and scale.  This project develops a practical and scalable electrochemical flow platform that is utilized in the development of oxidative coupling of phenols.  Many examples of flow chemistry utilize highly toxic and/or reactive species or reactions under extreme conditions.   This project focuses on generating and utilizing highly reactive diazoalkanes in complexity-generating reactions.  In addition to this research, the educational outreach focuses on developing a science summer camp at the high school level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  New laboratory experiments are being developed to introduce flow chemistry into the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory curriculum at Boston University."

The goal is to explore the fundamental bonding properties of uranium within the fullerene cage with other atoms such as carbon, sulfur, and oxygen.  Fullerenes are chemical compounds composed exclusively of many carbon atoms that are bonded together to form spherical or pseudo-spherical closed structures, that in some cases resemble nano-sized soccer balls.  Fullerenes are essential components in materials applications such as in solar cells and photovoltaics.  The hollow cavities inside these fullerenes offer a unique environment to study isolated chemical systems with unusual structures and bonding motifs as well as interesting electronic properties. The entrapment of metals or metal clusters inside these endohedral fullerenes provides a stable nanocontainer environment.  This enables the study of unique and unusual uranium clusters that will allow for a better fundamental and practical understanding of uranium electronic properties in particular and the actinide series of elements in general.  The project provides an entryway into an essentially new branch of fullerene and actinide science.  A group of students from the University of Texas at El Paso, which is a minority serving institution, are involved in the project.  Given the collaborative nature of the project, they are also exposed to an international research experience.  In addition, several learning modules, targeting middle school, mainly Hispanic science students, are developed.  This new, one month, 20-25 student community outreach program is intended to stimulate their interest in science while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. <br/><br/>In this project, a new series of uranium containing endohedral fullerenes is synthesized, purified and isolated.  It is expected that these carbon caged nanocontainers will allow access to unusual uranium clusters and provide a better fundamental understanding of actinide bonding and chemistry.  Initial results on the isolation and structural characterization of a non-IPR (Isolated Pentagon Rule) uranium endohedral, U@C80, provide incontrovertible support for the uniqueness of these molecules and the feasibility of the approach.  The synthetic methodology is being optimized using different reactor gases, while soot extraction conditions are being tested to maximize the yield. The isolated compounds are being studied through a full battery of techniques that includes X-ray crystallographic analysis, cyclic voltammetry, electronic and vibrational spectroscopy, SQUID magnetic analysis, and theoretical modeling to fully elucidate their structures and properties.

Professor Theopold is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Delaware.  He is extending the organometallic chemistry of chromium in previously unexplored directions.  One part of this project aims to explore the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of simple hydrocarbons.  The activation and functionalization of carbon (C)-hydrogen (H) bonds is a significant challenge and offers opportunities for the synthesis of useful organic molecules.  The other part of this project explores the reactivity of chromium alkylidenes in the highest possible oxidation state (VI) of that metal.  Such molecules are rare and their potential for catalytic transformation were unknown prior to this work. Accordingly, the research project is uncovering new catalytic reaction pathways that aid modern synthetic organic chemistry.  The work lies at the interface of inorganic and organic chemistry. Its broad reach is designed to train synthetic chemists at all levels.  Professor Theopold's outreach activities include service as judge for a high school science fair, volunteer work for the Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia, PA, and the publication of a textbook for General Chemistry courses for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics majors. <br/> <br/>Previous work in the Theopold laboratory has led to the discovery of several unusually stable dinuclear chromium alkyl hydrides of the type LCr(mu-R)(mu-H)CrL, which may be seen as products of the C-H activation of hydrocarbons, and which in turn engage in C-H activation reactions of simple hydrocarbons. One part of the project is to identify synthetic routes for the preparation and structural characterization of a wider range of such compounds.  This study facilitates an examination of their relative stability and reactivity.  The program also includes investigations of the mechanism of their reaction with hydrocarbons, leading to alkyl group exchange. In another extension of chromium chemistry, a rare chromium alkylidene has been prepared and its structure determined.  This project involves the synthesis of alkylidenes of the type (ArN)2Cr(VI)=CHR.  The reactivity of these unusually high-valent compounds has not previously been explored in any detail.  Potential catalytic applications involve olefin metathesis and polymerization.  The synthetic work is augmented by relevant DFT calculations.

Students will conduct individual research projects with a general focus on catalytic chemistry and in areas spanning from biological catalysis to organometallic chemistry to sustainable energy. This interconnected program is designed not only to teach the students about catalytic chemistry, but also to provide them with a foundation of the fundamentals of chemistry and chemical research.<br/><br/>The REU program will also include joint and parallel activities with other STEM REU programs in the College of Science, which includes programs in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the Materials Research Science & Engineering Center (MRSEC), the Bioscience Summer Undergraduate Research Program, the Native American Summer Research Internship (NARI), and the Center for Science and Math Education (CSME). Synergistic activities will include career development events, tours of scientific facilities, optional training sessions on various modern instrumentation, as well as extracurricular outings. Students will give presentations throughout the program and culminating with a presentation at a final, celebratory Symposium and Poster Session. Overall, the REU program aims to foster a sense of confidence in discussing and practicing chemistry by: (1) providing undergraduates with transformative research experiences in innovative chemistry projects under the guidance of faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, (2) educating students about their career options and providing them with a positive image of a career in chemistry, (3) exposing students to the greater scientific community by having our REU researchers interact with other researchers in the College of Science, many of whom will be outside of their immediate field of study."

Bacteria and fungi utilize complex metalloenzymes to generate N2O from the natural starting material nitric oxide (NO), but the fundamental chemical mechanisms for this process are not understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need to probe and understand this component of the global N-cycle, in particular, the role that metals play in mediating the production and consumption of such NOx gases of environmental and agricultural importance. Collaborators Dr. George Richter-Addo and Dr. Michael Shaw study non-protein chemical analogues of complex bacterial and fungal metalloenzymes to probe N2O formation and NOx utilization by these organisms. In particular, the team is preparing, isolating, and characterizing unstable intermediates along observed reaction pathways. These studies allow for a better understanding of how these gases are produced and controlled, and how nitrogen, an essential element in fertilizer required for crop growth, can be improved. The collaborative team combines a Ph.D. environment (at the University of Oklahoma) and a primarily undergraduate environment (at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville) to provide high-level training to a diverse group of students. The team is also active in introducing at-risk high school students and the general public to modern science. Dr. George Richter-Addo participates in a summer program designed for inner city high school kids at high risk for failure in academic programs.  Dr. Michael Shaw produces on-line lecture videos suitable for individuals with disabilities, thus representing an avenue of science outreach to a traditionally hard-to-reach underrepresented group.<br/><br/>Heme proteins are involved in the nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O) conversion of relevance to global warming, and in the inorganic-NOx to organo-NOx conversions of relevance to agricultural N-assimilation and nitrosative stress. Both processes are important, but their fundamental chemical pathways are not well understood, thus preventing further development of the chemistry of these components of the global N-cycle. With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, the collaborative research team of Dr. George Richter-Addo (University of Oklahoma) and Dr. Michael Shaw (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville) is determining the factors that lead to chemical reactivity of the bound NO ligand in synthetic porphyrin systems that model heme-containing enzymes in bacteria and fungi involved in N2O and/or organo-NOx generation. The collaborative team is determining the experimental conditions that favor nucleophilic attack of the bound NO ligand in ferric-NO porphyrins and promote N2O formation (via H-N bond formation; fungal N2O pathway) and organo-NOx generation (via C-N/N-N/S-N bond formation).  They are also determining the requirements for activating the bound NO ligand in ferrous-NO porphyrins towards N-N bond formation and N2O production (bacterial N2O pathway). The team utilizes a combination of chemical synthesis, spectroscopy, and advanced spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by density functional theory calculations for this research. The collaborative team is active in introducing at-risk high school students and the general public to modern science. In addition to developing new educational materials at the freshman (introductory chemistry) and graduate (electrochemistry) levels, the team actively participates in a summer program designed for ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged inner-city high school children. The team also produces on-line lecture videos in a rich multilayer flexible online environment suitable for individuals with disabilities, thus representing an avenue of science outreach to a traditionally hard-to-reach underrepresented group.  The investigators also produce and curate several freely available electrochemistry Labview software programs for general worldwide use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collagen has a huge array of functions from toughening our bones and giving strength to our skin to playing a key role in immunity.  Collagen is constructed by a multistep sequence of self-assembly of the molecular components. Despite collagen's ubiquity and importance, the underlying structure, stability and mechanism of assembly are poorly understood.  Prof. Hartgerink of Rice University conducts research to determine the rules of collagen stability and probe the assembly mechanisms.  This fundamental knowledge could lead to a better understanding of diseases associated with collagen malfunction and also help with the design of next-generation biomaterials which mimic collagen.  This research project provides the basis for interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education programs which combine chemical design with biology and medicine.  High school science teachers are recruited to work with the Hartgerink group in the summer to develop exciting curriculum based on cutting edge research that can be directly translated to their high school chemistry and biology courses.  These teachers later return with their entire science class for demonstrations and laboratory tours.  Integration of this interdisciplinary research with secondary education science goals helps to inspire both the students as well as their teachers toward STEM related fields.<br/><br/>There are two main goals in this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the National Science Foundation. The first goal is to expand our knowledge of pairwise amino acid interactions in the triple helix, the fundamental unit of collagen self-assembly.  These pairwise interactions modulate the stability of triple helices as well as their self-assembly.  Expanding this knowledge base is helping us to understand this important and extremely abundant protein family. In addition, it is providing new tools for chemists to design collagen based materials which are important for a wide variety of biomedical applications.  The second goal is to describe a rational system for the specific molecular recognition of any member of the collagen family. These collagen targeting peptides (CTPs) use the pairwise interactions discovered above for sequence specific molecular recognition of a given collagen triple helix. CTPs work in highly complicated chemical environments such as a slice of tissue where hundreds of other competing molecules co-exist. The design of these CTPs should allow them to specifically target any natural extracellular matrix collagens, collagens found in the innate immune system or those found in bacteria and viruses."

The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Undergraduates and graduate students in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will have opportunities to collaborate with experts from chemistry, engineering, and physics. Professor Todd Hudnall is also well poised to increase the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as Texas State University is one of the largest Hispanic Serving Institutes in Texas.  Professor Hudnall works with members of local high schools and children's museums to design science curricula dedicated to providing problem-based learning experiences through hands-on experimentation in the chemical and physical sciences. Members of Professor Todd Hudnall's research team and local high school students design and implement experiments that mimic the experiences of collegiate level researchers in order to encourage the high school students to pursue science degrees in college.  <br/><br/>The unique electronic configuration of stable organic radicals circumvents classical quantum mechanical limitations such as the Pauli Exclusion Principle, making these molecules good candidates for next generation energy/memory storage and organic light-emitting diode materials. The radical motifs are derived from singlet carbenes or carbene-inspired moieties that enables the rapid tailoring of the electrochemical and/or photophysical properties of the resultant organic radicals.  This strategy allows the synthesis of novel organic radical architectures to develop a dynamic structure-property correlation. These studies answer the following questions: 1) How do the electronic properties of the carbene influence the electrochemical and/or photophysical properties of the radical? 2) To what extent can the electrochemical window be expanded for these systems? 3) Will neutral radicals obtained by reduction of emissive cations likewise be emissive?

Complex mixtures are a major target of research in industrial and biochemical applications as well as from the perspective of fundamental science. These mixtures can have properties that depend strongly on the relative amounts of their different constituents as well as how they are assembled. From synthetic chemicals to models of biological membranes, such systems can be extremely challenging to characterize using mass spectrometry or any other technique. Dr. Prell and his group are developing new approaches for these characterization challenges, ultimately seeking to facilitate precise control of physical and chemical properties. The project combines state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with advanced mathematical and signal processing tools. Publicly available, open-source software created as part of this project will be made available for researchers around the world to use in analyzing these types of samples.

Membrane proteins are gates on these highly impermeable barriers, allowing selective exchange of substances and signals across the membrane. Understanding of the molecular recognition process leading to membrane protein structures is essential for improved understanding of protein evolution, function, and regulation. The aim this research is to establish a clear picture of the complexation of one model system, a multidrug efflux transporter, AcrB, in living cells and determine its stability in the cell membrane.

The Hope Hill Youth Service does not have STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education and so their students fall behind in math and science; the girls struggle to understand the opportunities that education can afford them, lacking dreams and motivation. The goals of these interactions are to broaden the knowledge of career opportunities for the girls.<br/> <br/>In this study, AcrB is used as a model system and its oligomerization in both detergent micelles and lipid bilayers is quantitatively characterized. The kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the trimer assembly process are monitored in cells and in reconstituted lipid bilayers using an array of assays and methods developed in preliminary studies. These include: a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method that is compatible with the characterization of AcrB subunit interaction in a lipid bilayer environment, a fluorescence-based method to monitor protein unfolding, and a disulfide-trapping based method to characterize the structure of AcrB in the cell membrane in its native state. These assays are suitable for monitoring and characterizing AcrB oligomerization in both detergent micelles and lipid bilayers. Furthermore, a collection of AcrB mutants with decreased trimer affinities have been created. The following research objectives are pursued: 1) investigation of the process of AcrB trimer assembly in cells; 2) determination of AcrB trimer stability in the cell membrane; and 3) characterization of AcrB trimer dissociation in lipid bilayers. Outcomes from this project bring new insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of assembly of a multi-span and multi-domain membrane protein trimer.

The rapidly increasing power of computers is making it ever more feasible to predict chemical reactivity through simulations.  Simulations, in concert with experiment, can accelerate scientific discovery, but this is only possible if the underlying theoretical model is sufficiently accurate.  Current prevailing models for electronic interactions are accurate for many, but not all, areas of chemistry.  The physical effects they fail to predict accurately are important for accurate descriptions of catalysis, optical materials, and semiconducting and superconducting systems.  The goal of this project is to build more accurate theoretical models at the fundamental level. The successful completion of this project expands the scope of quantum-mechanical based simulations and improves the quality and productivity of research in chemical and other physical sciences. The work is being done in the context of a new Computational Science program at MTSU, which is an interdisciplinary program that provides a unique opportunity to recruit students from non-chemistry backgrounds to pursue research in computational chemistry. MTSU has a student body with high percentages of undergraduate, minority and first-generation college students. Undergraduate students participate in computations that benchmark the activity of molecules or by coding  parts of the methods. A new molecular modeling course for upper-level undergraduates is being developed and the results of this project can be used for the new course and other undergraduate course work.<br/><br/>The strong correlation problem is the last frontier of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT).  It accounts for most of the failures of DFT for molecular and material systems. In this work, an accurate treatment of nondynamic/strong correlation is being developed based on single-determinant KS-DFT. The general-purpose functional treats strong correlation to the same degree of accuracy as current mainstream functionals treat weakly correlated molecular and extended systems. It is designed so that it can be implemented with sufficient efficiency for routine chemical applications with accurate treatment of both dynamic and nondynamic correlations. To achieve this goal, a general framework for nondynamic correlation is being developed based on the single-determinant KS scheme, subject to exact conditions. These conditions are specific for nondynamic correlation with degeneracy included and serve as guidelines for the development of a new model functional. Together with the development of an extensive benchmark database for nondynamic and strong correlation, and a new algorithm for efficient implementation, this functional significantly broadens the application of DFT to chemical and materials science problems involving electron correlation of all strengths.  The software and the corresponding features produced in this project are made available through open source programs and open source distribution sites such that it can be used with other programs. The availability of the source code also facilitates others to develop new DFT methods. This research is expected to have a major impact on the nascent Computational Science PhD Program at MTSU, one of a handful in the country."

Additional activities include providing graduate students (including those from groups that are underrepresented in the science) with opportunities to perform cutting-edge and pertinent research in the environmental chemical sciences.  Dr. Raff is developing an outreach program that provides local middle and high school students and their teachers with access to portable pollutant monitors for field trips and in-class experiments.<br/><br/>The goal of the research is to study how fast NOy adsorbs onto soil and the chemical processes that ""recycle"" nitrogen species back into the atmosphere. The multiphase chemistry of several NOy species on a variety of soil-related substrates are studied under environmentally relevant conditions using soil chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry techniques. Results from the activities ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the fate of reactive nitrogen in soil and the protection of human health against poor air quality.  As air quality standards for ground-level ozone become more strict, background levels of NOy that are influenced by soil emissions and multiphase chemistry of NOy on ground surfaces become more important. The kinetics studies allow modelers to more accurately parameterize soil NOy emissions in the chemical transport models.  Such simulations are used to predict the formation and movement of pollutants and inform pollution control policy."

Grassian of the University of California San Diego is investigating how metal-based nanomaterials change and transform in the environment. The proposed activities focus on molecular-based studies to better understand chemical changes in metal, metal oxide and metal sulfide nanoparticles in the environment. Although in the past decade, a number of studies have focused on environmental studies of nanoparticles in their native states, while only a few studies have focused on the molecular details of how nanoparticles can change due to chemical processing in the environment. Nanoparticles can age and undergo transformations under ambient conditions of temperature, relative humidity and in the presence of solar radiation. As these materials age and transform, their properties are altered making it difficult to identify structure?property?function and structure?property?hazard relationships. This research studies the impact of nanoparticle in the environment as well their interactions with biomolecules and biological systems.  The broader impact of these studies advance the goals of sustainable nanotechnology and provide a foundation for broadening participation and training and engaging students at all levels through research, teaching and outreach activities. These studies provide students with an opportunity to engage in a highly interdisciplinary research area that involves environmental science, nanoscience, engineering, colloid science, materials and surface chemistry.<br/><br/>This research program studies the cxidation of metal and metal sulfide nanoparticles in humid and aqueous environments, carbonate formation of metal oxide nanoparticles in humid environments, and surface ligand reactions (adsorption and displacement) on nanoparticles in aqueous environments.  These studies are used to better understand the potential environmental and health implications of nanoscience and nanotechnology and contribute to answering questions concerning the transformation and fate of manufactured nanomaterials.  As nanomaterials age and transform, their properties are altered making it difficult to identify structure-property-function and structure-property-hazard relationships. Therefore aging impacts their behavior in the environment as well their interactions with biomolecules and biological systems. In particular, the proposed activities focus on better understanding transformations of metal, metal oxide and metal sulfide nanoparticles (including Cu, CuO, CuS, Ag2S, ZnO ZnS and TiO2) on a molecular level and how these processes impact nanoparticle physicochemical properties important in the environmental, health, and safety (EHS) considerations of these materials."

At the center of most renewable energy schemes is the utilization of hydrogen fuel. The simplest environmentally benign approach to the production of hydrogen fuel involves the catalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen-forming portion of this process has been considered the most challenging transformation to promote. While it is known that two oxygen atoms must combine and bond together during catalysis to form oxygen, the precise mechanism through which this bond formation occurs is currently unknown, limiting the development of more efficient catalysts.  Professor Anderson is synthesizing and studying the catalytic activities of compounds that contain transition metal atoms in order to provide a new design principle for oxygen evolution catalysis.  Outside of the laboratory, Professor Anderson is engaging in collaborations with schools in Chicago's south side neighborhoods. He is helping students to prepare for science fairs and city-wide science competitions, and has created a summer internship for local high-school students to provide them with a ""hands-on"" science laboratory experience.  The aim of these efforts is to enhance the science education of a typically underserved group of students and to encourage their interest in careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Anderson is investigating the details and scope of a radical coupling mechanism for oxygen-oxygen bond formation in oxygen evolution catalysis by transition metal systems. This mechanistic hypothesis has recently gained increased favor, but there has been little investigation into either the degree of radical character on oxo ligands or the agency of radical character in oxygen-oxygen bond formation.  A low-coordinate pseudo-tetrahedral complex geometry will allow for the synthesis of metal-oxo compounds that are partially stabilized by metal-oxygen multiple bond character. These species are proposed intermediates in catalytic oxygen evolution, and this geometry is expected to engender unusual spin states and electronic structures that may be relevant for catalysis. Following their synthesis, these complexes are being characterized to determine the degree of spin delocalization onto the oxo ligand via a variety of techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, ENDOR spectroscopy, and various X-ray experiments and spectroscopies. Thorough characterization is enabling detailed structure-function studies. The relative viability of these complexes to engage in oxygen-oxygen bond forming catalysis, particularly with regards to their oxygen-centered spin density, will both inform current mechanistic hypotheses and provide a new design principle for oxygen evolution catalysis."

This chemical process produces manganese oxides that are widespread, highly reactive, efficient catalysts that play important roles in elemental biogeochemical cycles. Although these oxides are primarily made by microbial processes, the biological means for their formation are poorly understood. This project reveals the pathway of bacterial manganese oxide production, using the first purified active manganese-oxidizing enzyme complex. The project may uncover the biochemistry of how two processes-manganese oxidation and mineral formation-are achieved, laying the foundation for future application of biologically-derived manganese oxides in clean water technologies and energy storage and production. This project enhances the training of the next generation of scientists in interdisciplinary methods, and serves as a vehicle in outreach programs to engage undergraduate, middle, and high school students in studies of microbiology and biochemistry, as related to environmental science.  In addition, postdoctoral fellows develop a Saturday Academy course targeting either 6-8 or 9-12 grade students and focusing on the importance of microbiology and biochemistry as related to environmental science. The Saturday Academy provides professional development for the postdoctoral fellow as the instructor.<br/><br/>The project represents an investigation of how a purified protein can accomplish the difficult two-electron oxidation of Mn(II), forming a nanoparticulate MnO2 mineral product. Results to date indicate that the active protein belongs to the well-known multicopper oxidase family of enzymes, but with a unique ability to adapt the polynuclear chemistry of manganese to perform the catalysis. The research efforts are focused on establishing a molecular-level detailed mechanism of the catalysis, by resolving manganese oxidation intermediates and studying the effects of key mutations with an array of spectroscopic techniques. The spectroscopic studies are complemented by modeling, crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy work to derive the 3D atomic structure of the enzyme. In the context of broader environmental applicability, the research explores the effect of other metals occurring in the environment on the enzymatic catalysis of manganese oxidation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is hypothesized that controlled sulfidation of iron metal (Fe(0)) through chemical or biological means creates surfaces that have significantly enhanced reactivity towards chlorinated ethenes.  This study explores the use of environmentally-compatible reactive surfaces for in situ abatement of persistent groundwater contaminants. This research provides a training ground for undergraduate and graduate researchers to engage in multidisciplinary investigations in environmental biogeochemistry and remediation. The findings are incorporated into a new course on Environmental Interfacial Chemistry. In addition, the investigators develop experiment kits and introduce the subject of groundwater contamination to K-12 students through science enrichment programs at TTU.<br/>  <br/>The investigators take an integrated experimental approach to probe the relationship between the chemistry of the sulfided materials prepared under different conditions and the reactions of perchloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) on these reactive surfaces. Key factors controlling the rates and pathways of PCE and TCE degradation on these surfaces are elucidated through kinetic and isotopic investigations. The interface between a sulfided overlayer and an Fe(0) phase provides a sustained driving force against oxidative passivation in the environmental media.  The transformation of surface sulfided iron and natural iron sulfides in groundwater environment, particularly under the influence of pertinent biogeochemical processes, are studied.  This study advances the fundamental understanding of interactions between chlorinated ethenes and reactive surfaces that are either introduced by engineering intervention or naturally present in the subsurface environment.

Catalysts are critical to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries where they are used to reduce energy requirements of chemical processes and to orient precise chemical transformations. Many of the most active catalysts are based on rare metals that are quite costly and difficult to find and isolate. An important area of current research seeks to find cheap, abundant replacements for these expensive catalysts. Phosphorus (P) is an abundant, inexpensive element. However, there has been little effort made to devise catalysts based on it. Dr. Matthew Cain, Department of Chemistry, University of Hawaii at Manoa, is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, to prepare unusual compounds where phosphorus atoms are in unusual oxidation states and may behave like metals under certain circumstances. Thus, phosphorus may represent an alternative to the rare, expensive metal catalysts currently being used.  This research may lead to highly unusual catalysts which could have transformative impact - replacing expensive and toxic platinum group metals in major industrial and pharmaceutical reactions.  In addition, this project includes an educational component that is designed to attract Native Hawaiian students into science. Native Hawaiians, although they constitute a sizable fraction of the population in the State of Hawaii, are very underrepresented in science and technology. Thus, this aspect of the projects provides an important, new opportunity to the Native Hawaiian population. <br/><br/><br/>Using monoanionic pincers featuring an equatorial carbon-aryl donor and electron-withdrawing axial donors, hypervalent 10-P-3 species with the correct frontier orbital environment to promote oxidative addition are prepared.

Ultimately, 1,2-difunctionalization, particularly, hydrogenation, hydrosilation, and diboration of simple organic substrates is tested with 10-P-3 catalysts. In addition, the project is developing a three-tiered approach of exposing, attracting, and inspiring the Native Hawaiian and Asian-American/Hawaiian-born population to become involved in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to design and optimize novel catalysts to yield specific enantiomers.  It is often important to select one specific enantiomer because the other is ineffective or harmful. New synthetic methods developed in this research may have applications in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials chemistry. An integral part of this program is to recruit and prepare a diverse STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce to advance the frontiers of science.

As a consequence, catalytic reactions that can readily increase the structural complexity of molecules while maintaining control of the stereochemistry of the newly formed stereocenters are of importance in drug discovery and development. Visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potentially powerful tool in organic synthesis.  This catalysis has changed the way in which chemists approach some difficult synthetic problems. Precise stereocontrol of photocatalytic reactions remains a significant challenge. This research focuses on the design and development of chiral Lewis acid catalysts which enable stereoselective, visible-light mediated photoredox catalysis. These new catalysts are applied to enantioselective cross-coupling reactions of carbonyl and iminyl derivatives with alkenes. This project generates a library of novel tridentate chiral ligands and chiral catalysts that guide the development of asymmetric chemical transformations. The hands-on organic synthesis activities developed by Professor Ngai enrich the educational experience of high school students and encourage them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education.

This in turns allows for the study of how those variation alter the molecules properties. The molecules targeted for synthesis have a wide variety of potential applications ranging from their use as semiconductors with charge/energy transport properties for use in organic electronic devices and as liquid crystal materials to pharmaceutical applications in connection with the opium alkaloids. Much of the project lies at the interface of organic, computational, and materials chemistry.

Such routes introduce functionality at non-functionalized centers, thereby eliminating the need for complex pre-functionalized starting materials.  The chemistry studied is contributing to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis by 1) engineering reactions at non-functionalized centers, thereby eliminating the need for complex pre-functionalized starting materials, 2) using oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent, and 3) using less toxic and less expensive base metals. Transformations that are being pursued include oxidative phenol coupling to bring together three or more aromatic subunits, which are then oxidized further to provide polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with selective peripheral functionalization.  Kinetic resolution is being explored with oxidative phenol coupling to create complex enantioenriched architectures, such as precursors to the opium alkaloids.  Finally, oxidative coupling of the sp3 centers of alkyl arenes with a range of tertiary nucleophiles are being explored. Successful development of the methods is having a broad impact on a number of areas as there is a need to access such structures in the pharmaceutical, chemical, materials science, and agricultural industries as well as in basic biological and chemical research endeavors.

Professor Shelli Frey from Gettysburg College and colleagues Kurt Andresen, Katherine Buettner and Lucas Thompson have acquired a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer. Many chemical and biological molecules are chiral (having structures that are not superimposable - like our hands). Chiral molecules that are prevalent in living organisms can exist in two forms. These forms can be described as having left-handed or right-handed conformations. A CD spectrometer can determine which form or whether a mixture of both forms is present. The spectrometer can follow changes as the chiral molecule binds to another molecule (ligand), rearranges its structure, or reacts (perhaps with a drug or an antibody). Therefore, CD spectroscopy is suitable for probing protein (or other macromolecular) structures or changes to structures due to environmental conditions. CD spectroscopy has been widely used for three types of measurements: identifying the structure of proteins, studying the geometry changes during folding and unfolding of proteins, and determining the energies involved in binding interactions and protein unfolding. This spectrometer is used by undergraduates. While being trained to use this important tool, the research experience prepares the students for future careers and advanced degrees in medical and scientific fields.

Biomass is a ""carbon neutral"" feedstock because it grows by incorporating CO2 from the atmosphere while only consuming solar energy. This project is finding new and efficient outlets to generate useful chemicals from components of biomass that are currently difficult to process.  While most biomass conversions are presently performed using catalysts and energy supplied by heat, this work is exploiting unique aspects of electricity-driven catalytic reactions in order to achieve synthesis of useful chemicals at low temperatures and pressures. The electricity required for these processes may, in turn, be derived from renewable sources such as wind and solar. A fundamental approach is being taken in which experimental techniques that probe the nature of the catalytic reactions are combined with computer simulations to build a comprehensive picture of the factors that govern reaction selectivity and to design more efficient processes. Insights from this work have broader application in extending the scope of green chemistry. This research is also being used to promote science education by involving undergraduate student researchers for summer internships, and the PI's are additionally developing a series of interactive educational modules related to understanding the physical processes governing electro-catalytic reactions. <br/><br/>     This project is investigating electrochemical control over selectivity in the conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks to desired chemical targets. Electrochemical conversions offer advantages in sustainable processing since they generally operate at low temperatures and utilize aqueous feedstocks directly.  Using selective oxidation of furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural over Pt electrodes as probe systems, this work focuses on determining the different mechanisms by which selectivity can be manipulated through control over electrode potential and composition. Mechanisms being explored include differentiation of charge-transfer reactions relative to neutral atom transfer reactions, variation in surface coverage of oxygen and organic species, and the role of promoters with specific reactivity or geometry. Three complementary research approaches are being integrated to characterize these effects. Measurement of electrochemical kinetics on metal catalysts is combined with in-situ spectroscopy to identify reaction pathways; surface science experiments are used on a model Pt(111) surface to study oxidation elementary steps in detail; and finally, density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the same surface chemistry, including simulation of electric potential effects and the water-metal interface. The three research thrusts provide complementary information and enrich the depth of understanding of the electrochemical environment.

This chemistry can be carried out in an electrochemical cell, but there are also recent advances showing that it is possible to do CO2 conversion with light. Thus, one goal is to react CO2 and water with sunlight to generate chemicals that are important both as fuels and as raw materials. Whether this chemistry is carried out electrochemically or photochemically, the reactions require energy. Practical CO2 conversion processes require that the energy input be as small as possible. To that end, catalysts are needed that minimize this energy input while also providing desirable reaction products. Presently, there is only limited understanding of the chemistry needed to build both electrocatalysts and photocatalysts that achieve such efficiency. The Bocarsly research group is advancing the understanding of the fundamental underlying chemistry necessary to develop practical CO2 catalysts. They are using this knowledge to construct new catalysts with improved chemical activity, product selectivity, and energy consumption. This knowledge-based advancement in catalyst design is critical to produce new routes to CO2 utilization that are environmentally responsible and socially beneficial. Dr. Bocarsly is actively engaging in outreach activities related to his research efforts including the education of next generation chemical researchers and K-12 outreach activities carried out under Princeton's Summer Laboratory Learning Program. His activities include a special program to encourage undergraduates in underrepresented groups to consider graduate education in the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>Funding from the National Science Foundation makes possible Dr. Bocarsly's studies at Princeton University on catalysts for electrochemical and photochemical CO2 utilization. Electrocatalytic studies focus on the use of metal alloy systems to address both materials science (i.e. electrode composition) and mechanistic question necessary to understand the reduction of aqueous CO2 to organic oxygenates. Presently, an understanding of the detailed mechanisms that allow the coupling of electron and proton transfer in the reduction of CO2 is being sought. Of particular interest is the reduction of CO2 to form carbon-carbon bonds. Three types of studies are underway: 1) The role of meta-stable surface oxides in the reduction of CO2; 2) The photochemical and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO using manganese carbonyl complexes as homogeneous catalysts; 3) Mixed metal electrodes as PCET catalysts for the formation of multiple carbon products. Understanding unifying chemical themes that underlie all these systems is transformative in terms of fundamental chemistry and the capability it brings in the areas of new fuel resources and environmental protection. Dr. Bocarsly is heavily involved in the education of next generation electrochemical researchers, who are key to an environmentally sensitive alternate energy future. In addition, Dr. Bocarsly carries out activities in the areas of community outreach and K-12 education through Princeton's Materials Program and Princeton's Summer Laboratory Learning Program.

Fluorine is an essential constituent of myriad drugs, agrochemicals and materials that are crucial to public healthcare and industry. However, the tools to selectively install fluorine into organic molecules are either limited or in some cases nonexistent. Specifically, current methods for nucleophilic fluorination often rely on harsh conditions with traditional reagents resulting in low reactivity, selectivity and/or tolerance to other functional groups. This research leads to the invention of new latent HF sources for catalysis, the design of general strategies that enable mild and selective C-F bond formation, and the preparation of valuable fluorine-containing synthons for chemical synthesis. These strategies are also adapted for the synthesis of radiolabeled small molecules for use in positron emission tomography (PET), an important diagnostic tool for imaging the brain. The students supported under this program receive training in research, writing, communication skills, and mentoring. Through various programs, Professor Doyle recruits and mentors students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Professor Doyle organizes the Princeton University Student Invited Lecture Series;  she and her students participate in outreach activities to encourage early engagement in the sciences.<br/><br/>The key focus of this research is the development of new methods for nucleophilic C-F bond formation enabled by novel strategies for in situ generation of HF from abundant, stable fluoride reagents.

Many research groups are investigating ways to convert carbon dioxide into other useful molecules.   Clearly, better understating of how such conversions are done may lead to more effective ways of achieving such conversions.

The project lies at the interface of inorganic, physical and materials chemistry, and is well suited to the education of scientists at different levels, from high school students to Ph.D. graduates.  The program offers a multidisciplinary training ground for undergraduate and graduate<br/>students. The proposal includes year-round undergraduate research projects and is part of the departmental REU program.

The project combines the use of synthesis, kinetics, and heavy atom (13C and 18O) isotope effects with density functional theory calculations to address bond formation, bond cleavage, and electron transfer mechanisms during carbon dioxide activation.  The project seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What values of 13C and 18O kinetic isotope effects characterize transition metal-catalyzed carbon dioxide reduction reactions? (2) Can the driving force and nucleophilicity of a catalyst influence the heavy atom isotope effects measured in carbon dioxide reduction reactions? (3) What 13C and 18O equilibrium isotope effects characterize the various transition metal- carbon dioxide binding modes?

Asa-Awuku of the University of Maryland College Park are supported to develop a molecular level understanding of how the chemical composition of the surface of soot (black carbon, BC) influences its ability to act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and form rain droplets.  Black carbon particles are released into the Earth's atmosphere from forest fires, biomass burning, and coal and diesel engines.  Experimental evidence provides strong support for the idea that the ability of black carbon particles to uptake water depends on the presence of water-attracting functional groups on the black carbon particle surface.  However, atmospheric black carbon is considered water-repellant in scientific models and thus not aptly addressed in aerosol-cloud climate interactions, contributing to the largest source of uncertainty in climate predictions.  The surface chemistry of black carbon particles is complex and varies considerably due to differences in the carbon source, combustion conditions and subsequent oxidation (aging) in air.  This project seeks a better understanding of how surface reactivity influences black carbon's ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei.  Establishing relationships between the surface chemistry and CCN properties of BC particles in the atmosphere improves the predictive capabilities of global climate models and enhances our scientific understanding of air quality and climate, two important societal concerns.

The specific tasks are to develop experimental methods to modify and characterize the chemistry and surface properties of atmospherically-relevant aerosol, and to address unknown contributions of BC to atmospheric CCN and the subsequent aerosol-indirect effect.  Detailed information on the surface composition and distribution of surface oxides is obtained with various analytical techniques, including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, augmented by chemical derivatization and infrared spectroscopies. The effect of other heteroatoms on CCN properties is also explored as well as the relationship between CCN activation and more fundamental BC surface properties, such as water adsorption energies."

Nanoparticles of inorganic mineral phases are widespread in water-based environmental systems. Natural and synthetic nanoparticles are highly effective in remediation strategies for contaminated waters, such as those that result from metal ore mining activities. This research develops models to predict metal fate and transport in natural waterways.  These studies maximize metal retention and reduce metal mobility in contaminated systems. Broader impacts of this work include the creation of independent research opportunities for undergraduate, community college, and high school students (targeting females, under-represented minorities, and low-income populations), providing students with experiences using national synchrotron user facilities, and incorporating new findings in nanoparticle research to the undergraduate curricula in environmental and inorganic chemistry. High school chemistry and environmental science teachers are engaged in the research methods and outcomes through on-campus visits and lesson development.<br/><br/>The fate and speciation of metal ion species sorbed to aggregated nanoparticles are largely unknown.  Metal sorption to nanoaggregates serves as an important means of natural attenuation and provides considerable potential for the effective remediation of metal-contaminated surface aqueous systems. Specifically, with increasing aggregation state, salinity, and time, metal uptake declines due to loss of reactive surface area but metal retention may increase due to trapping of sorbed ions onto/into the more complex confined aggregate structures. This project advances our understanding of the fundamental processes that control the retention and sequestration of metal ions onto nanoscale iron oxyhydroxide particles and their aggregates. The research impacts the emerging field of environmental nanoscience, particularly the role that nanoscale particles play in the remediation of metal-contaminated sites."

In this project, Dr. Nie of the University of Maryland College Park develops new strategies to control the directional bonding of nanoparticles to form structures that resemble the geometry of small molecules. One goal of creating such molecule-like architectures from nanoparticles is to enable new technologies for applications in medicine, optoelectronics, energy production, and/or energy storage.

Valentine of Temple University is supported to explore the interaction of titanium oxide surfaces with metal-scavenging biomolecules and/or microorganisms. Titanium is very abundant both in the environment and in organisms, and increasingly used in consumer products and industrial applications.  Titanium is not widely appreciated as a bioactive element as it has a reputation for extreme inertness and insolubility in water. This research examines the ability of titanium dioxide to stick to (adhere) and release from well-characterized biomolecules and from a bacterium. Iron-scavenging biomolecules bind titanium especially tightly and keep it soluble and stable. They can also cause the release of large quantities of titanium ions into solution. This research sheds light on the impact of microorganisms on the environmental chemistry of titanium and reveals the biological role of titanium. The research is integrated with a new outreach program for rising high school juniors called Philadelphia Environmental Chemistry Explorations (PECE). Environmental bioinorganic chemistry is used as a platform to broaden participation in science.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on the interactions of iron-scavenging siderophores and bacteria with titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces. This inquiry sits at the intersection of inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, biogeochemistry, and materials and environmental chemistry. Siderophores bind strongly to TiO2, and some siderophores dissolve titanium ions from the metal oxide surface, significantly remodeling the mineral in the process. Electronic spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry reveal metal ion concentrations and speciation in solution. The oxide surface and properties before, during, and after dissolution are being probed using Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transfer Infrared (ATR-FTIR) as well as microscopy and related techniques. The mutual interference of titanium and iron is a special focus. Microbe/oxide and biomolecule/oxide interactions are being studied using the bacterium Rhodococcus ruber GIN-1, which adheres to titanium dioxide and incorporates significant quantities of titanium into its biomass. Titanium dioxide surface binding proteins are being identified and characterized.  Their abundance and properties are correlate to whole-organism phenomena. Titanium uptake is being quantified and intracellular titanium-binding molecules isolated. A research program is maintained that educates and trains undergraduates and graduate students at the interface of inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.

It is a collaboration between Professors Jinyong Liu and David Volz at the University of California, Riverside, and Prof. Yujie Men at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Together with their graduate students they study perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). PFCs are a family of chemicals that have the same carbon backbone as hydrocarbons but all atoms attached to the carbon backbone are fluorine instead of hydrogen. Carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds are highly stable. Surfaces modified with PFCs are resistant to both water and oil. Thus, PFCs are widely used in fire-fighting foams, electronics, lubricants, outdoor apparel and equipment, and on-sticking cooking ware. The stability of C-F bonds makes PFCs also very difficult to degrade in the natural environment. Synthetic PFCs have been globally detected in the environment and living organisms. Bioaccumulation of PFCs has been connected to a variety of human health problems. However, current technologies are not effective in PFC degradation via breaking the C-F bonds (i.e., defluorination). Therefore, it is desired to develop both new PFCs that can be degraded more easily and new strategies for removing these compounds from the environment.   This research investigates the structure-activity relationships, reaction mechanisms, and products of cobalt-catalyzed removal of fluorine from of PFCs in abiotic and microbial environments. Outcomes may contribute to solving PFC pollution challenges by providing fundamental guidelines to the design of novel degradable PFCs and microbial remediation in natural environments.<br/><br/>This research employs a multi-faceted approach combining chemical and biological tools to investigate cobalt (Co)-catalyzed defluorination of PFCs. The team investigates the product of PFC defluorination after Co-catalyzed reactions. The structure-activity relationship between the Co coordination sphere in chemically and biologically synthesized complexes and the defluorination activity is investigated.  The redox environment enabling abiotic and microbial defluorination reactions is determined. Three PhD students receive interdisciplinary training. Undergraduate and high school researchers from a diverse student population are exposed to interdisciplinary training, specifically topics related of sustainability. The broad community is reached via a public-oriented science conference and other events.  Results may be applied to biomimetic catalyst system design, synthesis of novel fluoro-pharmaceuticals, and toxicology evaluation of novel fluorochemicals.

Simplifying access to functionalized nitrogen (N)-heterocycles is useful for the advancement of biological and medicinal studies.  The experiments being conducted use the novel reactivity of electrophilic metal N-aryl catalytic intermediates in the development of new carbon-nitrogen bond-forming reactions of aryl azides and nitroarenes.  The projects address gaps in state-of-the-art methods to access complex, functionalized N-heterocyclic compounds through construction of carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon bonds by developing synthetic methods that are mechanistically distinct from existing protocols. Towards that end, the principle investigator's goals are to: (1) develop new metal-catalyzed domino carbon-hydrogen amination reactions to efficiently access N-heterocycles from aryl azides; (2) synthesize N-heterocycles from nitroarenes through a metal-catalyzed cyclization-migration sequence or carbon-hydrogen amination; (3) achieve intermolecular sp2 and sp3 carbon-hydrogen amination reactions using nitroarenes; (4) determine if the reactivity patterns observed for electrophilic metal N-aryl nitrenes are a general phenomenon of divalent catalytic intermediates by studying metal-carbenes formed from N-tosylhydrazones.  The compounds resulting from these studies are added to the University of Illinois at Chicago Center (UICentre) for Drug Discovery's novel small molecule library and submitted to Professor Driver's High-Throughput Screening (HTS) facility in order to initiate new collaborations.  This project serves as means for the training of students to advance in their scientific careers.  By emphasizing the participation of female and underrepresented minority students, this program helps meet the goals outlined by PCAST (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology) to transform and improve the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) student pipeline."

Professor Scheidt is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University. He is developing new classes of chemical catalysts. Chemical catalysts enable the efficient and sustainable synthesis of new small molecules and materials that are important for pharmaceutical, material science, and biomedical research communities. Because of their utility in these areas, catalysts derived from Lewis bases (molecules capable of donating an electron pair), and in particular N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), have been of particular interest, and work with these systems has exploded during the last decade. In this effort, NHCs have frequently been employed as ligands to generate chiral metal complexes as well as catalysts in their own right in the absence of a transition metal (metal free or organocatalysis). Yet in spite of this effort, little is known about how NHC-based catalysts can be tuned in order to optimize their performance in new classes of reactions. For this reason, the Scheidt group is exploring a novel family of NHC-transition metal complexes as catalysts. These new systems can be used to systematically study how changes in structure alter the properties and catalytic behavior of the NHC. The work has broad implications for how new catalysts in the NHC-family will be designed in the future. The project lies at the intersection of organic, asymmetric synthesis, and catalysis and thus is excellent for training and education in interdisciplinary science. In terms of broader impacts of the project, Dr. Scheidt is actively engaged in outreach activities focused on underrepresented group recruitment into the STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>The sustainability and advancement of society relies on new discoveries based on molecular science.

The specific synthetic targets selected for the effort are alpha-boryl amines. Since there are major limitations to the currently available methods for alpha-borylation reactions that have hampered the use of the chosen targets as synthetic building blocks, the choice of the alpha boryl amines as targets nicely highlights the broad synthetic implications of the catalysts being developed. The mechanistic insights being gained center on advancing our knowledge of Lewis base and transition metal catalysis and determining the structure-reactivity relationships that govern catalyst behavior.

In modern science and technology, materials chemistry plays an big role in the production of advanced optoelectronic materials, semiconductors and superconductors, solar cell and battery materials. To enable the discovery of new materials and to answer experimental questions, theory has to predict experimentally relevant, measurable quantities. In the last fifty years, the majority of quantum chemistry research was focused on the development of methodological advances for molecular systems.  Currently molecular problems can be described very accurately. However, for large strongly correlated molecules and solids, quantum chemistry still lacks computational tools that describe electronic correlation accurately in a systematically improvable manner and deliver experimentally useful predictions. The development of novel ab-initio theoretical methods that are at the interface of quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics and are capable of delivering useful experimental predictions for solids is the major aim of this research. This interdisciplinary project involves training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs by allowing them to understand their research in the broadest possible sense.  The research prepares them for a wide range of careers. Dr. Zgid is also actively engaged in public outreach for minorities in Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) by organizing workshops for middle school girls.          <br/>The Green's function language provides a natural link to experiment, since spectra can be readily calculated without the cumbersome excited state formalism present in wave function or density theories. Green's function methods are controlled, reliable, and systematically improvable and may easily be generalized by employing embedding methods to work for solids or large molecules. In order to calculate excitation spectra, this project implements the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a second order Green's function method and self-energy embedding approaches. The formalism is calibrated on small molecules and subsequently extended to solids by using embedding methods.  Since the realism and predictive power of quantum mechanical simulations depend on the accuracy of modelling all electrons, significant attention is given to the investigation of effective Hamiltonian approaches that aim to make Green's function embedding methods quantitative for realistic molecular and crystalline systems. Finally, since the Green's function is a large object that can be calculated in parallel, the investigation focuses on efficient ways of expressing Green's functions in computer implementations.  A major outcome of the project is software containing efficient, reliable and systematically improvable Green's function embedding methods for solids that is released to the public. Additionally, Dr. Zgid's research group is preparing a series of lecture notes for graduate students explaining Green's functions in order to reduce the language barrier frequently experienced by quantum chemists when working with the Green's function formalism. The proposed interdisciplinary research involves training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs allowing them to understand their research in the broadest possible sense and prepares them for wide range of careers.

The use of optical microscopy has greatly progressed over the last decade. Many optical microscopic methods have been used in materials and biological imaging as well as chemical sensing. While these techniques hold great promise in sensitivity, some do require high and potentially damaging light intensities in illumination. What is now needed, is a chemical imaging technique which takes advantage of the highly focused behavior of the two photon process, but at the same time it keeps the peak intensity at low levels. The imaging technique under development by Professor Goodson uses a beam of light where the quantum states of photon pairs are linked, i.e. entangled photons. Utilizing the property of quantum entanglement, Professor Goodson and his group probe and image molecules with extremely high resolution and with a very small number of photons.  The developed technique subsequently enables them to study interesting biological systems such as tissue imaging and the formation of amyloids with Alzheimer's patients.  This support from the National Science Foundation also helps to train and mentor a diverse group of scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral students) in areas such as chemistry, physics and materials science.<br/><br/>With this grant, Professor Goodson at the University of Michigan and his research group are investigating a new approach to chemical sensitivity through entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) microscopy. The entangled two-photon microscopy concept provides a breakthrough over the classical TPA microscopy allowing 10 orders of magnitude lower excitation intensity which is of immense importance for biological and materials applications. The objectives of the project are to a) demonstrate the limits of sensitivity of the ETPA microscopy at very low input flux, b) test the ETPA microscope's ability to probe important chemical processes at very low input flux and with enhanced spatial resolution, and c) apply the methodology to an important chemical system illustrating the impact of the ETPA microscopy method. The broader impact of the work: a) provides summer educational experience in optics through the WISE program for middle school students, b) provides a broader experience for high school students in chemistry and physics with an emphasis on optics, and c) develops and expands a workshop for the next generation professors who might have a strong interest in the physical sciences including optics.  The impact of this investigation also includes providing the chemical and imaging community a new approach with important details regarding the specifics of the methodology, materials, and theory."

Even upon degradation, the byproducts of plastics are sometimes toxic and serve no useful or active purpose in the environment.  The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of NSF Chemistry Division supports the efforts of Professors Patton and Mavrodi at the University of Southern Mississippi to advance the design of degradable polymers.  Essential oil derivatives are used as primary building blocks of the polymers.  The materials are designed to undergo complete degradation under mild conditions resulting in regeneration of essential oils. Stemming from the broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal activity observed for many essential oil constituents, these degradable materials are potentially useful for a range of pharmaceutical, biomedical, and agricultural applications. The researchers have established active outreach programs to local K-12 schools including the ?What is a Polymer? program (impacting > 500 students annually) and the ?Discover Nature? summer science camp. A new outreach initiative and collaboration with the local 3D (Dynamic Dyslexia Design) School is initiated.  ?Science Nights @ 3D? engage dyslexic students (and their families) with hands-on activities that require visual, kinesthetic, and auditory processing while introducing fundamental, grade appropriate science and math concepts.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is the design, synthesis, and characterization of degradable polymer thermosets called ""pro-active networks from degradable acetals (PANDAs)"" via thiol-ene photopolymerization.  The approach is rooted in the design of multifunctional acyclic and cyclic acetal monomers derived from essential oil precursors that enable control over network chemistry and network structure for tunable degradation profiles.  PANDAs covalently incorporate aldehydes (e.g., vanillin, anisaldehyde, citronellal) and phenolic compounds (carvacrol, thymol) derived from essential oils directly into the polymer network via an acetal linkage - either as pendant groups (cyclic acetal) or as an integral part of the polymer backbone (acyclic acetal).  Exposure to conditions conducive to acetal degradation (e.g., change in humidity/pH) regenerates the essential oil building blocks.  Degradation profiles are determined to ascertain the erosion mechanism (surface vs. bulk) and aldehyde/phenol release kinetics, and to correlate degradation/release profiles with chemical and physical properties of the polymer network (e.g., hydrophobicity and crosslink density).  The project actively trains a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research environment and engages local K-12 schools, in outreach.  This includes a collaboration with the local Dynamic Dyslexia Design (3D) School."

Professors Howard Fairbrother of Johns Hopkins University and Akua A. Asa-Awuku of the University of Maryland College Park are supported to develop a molecular level understanding of how the chemical composition of the surface of soot (black carbon, BC) influences its ability to act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and form rain droplets.  Black carbon particles are released into the Earth's atmosphere from forest fires, biomass burning, and coal and diesel engines.  Experimental evidence provides strong support for the idea that the ability of black carbon particles to uptake water depends on the presence of water-attracting functional groups on the black carbon particle surface.  However, atmospheric black carbon is considered water-repellant in scientific models and thus not aptly addressed in aerosol-cloud climate interactions, contributing to the largest source of uncertainty in climate predictions.  The surface chemistry of black carbon particles is complex and varies considerably due to differences in the carbon source, combustion conditions and subsequent oxidation (aging) in air.  This project seeks a better understanding of how surface reactivity influences black carbon's ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei.  Establishing relationships between the surface chemistry and CCN properties of BC particles in the atmosphere improves the predictive capabilities of global climate models and enhances our scientific understanding of air quality and climate, two important societal concerns.  While conducting the project, the students benefit from acquiring skills in surface chemistry and atmospheric science.  A plan that targets the participation of female undergraduate students in science majors at the Notre Dame University of Maryland, a local, primarily teaching, institution is initiated.  <br/><br/>The project aims to develop a molecular level understanding of how the chemical composition of the surface of black carbon influences its ability to act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN).  The goal is accomplished by measuring and analyzing the CCN properties of a suite of black carbon particles whose surface chemistry has been systematically varied via exposure to different oxidizing conditions.  The specific tasks are to develop experimental methods to modify and characterize the chemistry and surface properties of atmospherically-relevant aerosol, and to address unknown contributions of BC to atmospheric CCN and the subsequent aerosol-indirect effect.  Detailed information on the surface composition and distribution of surface oxides is obtained with various analytical techniques, including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, augmented by chemical derivatization and infrared spectroscopies. The effect of other heteroatoms on CCN properties is also explored as well as the relationship between CCN activation and more fundamental BC surface properties, such as water adsorption energies."

Many of these molecules are chiral, which means that they exist as non-superimposable mirror images.  These mirror image structures often behave differently in biological systems. For example, chiral pharmaceuticals typically show different efficacy depending on which mirror-image structure is administered.  Given their importance in biological and biomedical applications, it is therefore crucial to prepare these molecules as a single chiral structure, also known as an enantiomer. However, methods to prepare the desired enantiomer of many molecules are limited, and this curbs the discovery of potential medicines and biological probes. In this project, Dr. Mary Watson is developing a strategy using catalysts for the synthesis of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds that will allow the efficient synthesis of molecules that are currently difficult to prepare as single enantiomers. The catalysts are themselves single enantiomers, and she is also studying the fundamental interactions between the catalyst and the organic substrates to enable broad understanding of the mechanism of these reactions, and especially how the chirality of the catalyst is ultimately conveyed to that of the chiral product. Dr. Watson is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon her research to provide opportunities for students of all levels to engage in science.

Professor Giuseppe Petrucci of the University of Vermont investigates the role of water (humidity) in the formation and ageing of organic particles in the atmosphere. Leafy trees and plants release volatile organic compounds during photosynthesis and respiration. These compounds react with pollutants like ozone to produce the majority of organic particles in the atmosphere.  Professor Petrucci and his group explore how humidity influences the chemical composition of particles, the phase (liquid or solid) of the particle, and their ability to scatter and/or absorb light. Understanding the chemical changes that these particles undergo once they are formed is crucial for understanding their impact on the atmosphere. This research is leading to a better understanding of the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, in terms of effects on human health, visibility, and climate. Training is provided to graduate and undergraduate students.  The research team also carries out outreach to K-12 students at various levels through the University of Vermont Chemistry Camp. <br/> <br/>Determining the composition of organic particles in the atmosphere is challenging because each particle may contain hundreds of different molecules. In addition, the types of molecules may change during the particle's time in the atmosphere, which is typically five to seven days. Professor Petrucci and his group develop a novel environmental chamber setup for the study of chemical processes during particle formation. This chamber allows the use of mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques to study the particle's composition.  These techniques also provide information on changes in particle composition due to changes in reaction conditions, like humidity. Further, using a separate approach, the researchers impinge particles at a hard surface and count how many bounce off compared to how many stick. Solid particles bounce, while liquid particles stick. The phase of the particles is compared with particle composition. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to predict the physical and optical properties of organic particles based on their chemical composition. This information is used to develop models that describe the effect of aerosols on the Earth's radiation balance and the formation and properties of clouds.

Such control is needed to develop the capability of systematically screening the chemical space in search of novel polyheterocyclic molecular architectures with the requisite scaffold diversity. To further grow scaffold complexity and diversity and to decorate the core scaffolds with additional functional groups and heterocyclic pendants, experimentally simple postphotochemical steps are deployed after the light-induced transformation. This experimental work is accompanied by the development of computational methods for fast and accurate predictions of NMR spectra, which is critical for success of this project, but also has broader implications for structure elucidation of complex synthetic and natural organic molecules.

The energy of the ejected electrons reveals information about how strongly the electrons were bound to a molecule as well as the type and strength of chemical bonds within the molecule.  Clusters are aggregates of atoms or molecules held together by the same cohesive forces responsible for the existence of solids and liquids. Anions of molecules and clusters are negatively-charged ions of these entities (i.e., they have more than the needed number of electrons).

Biomass is a ""carbon neutral"" feedstock because it grows by incorporating CO2 from the atmosphere while only consuming solar energy. This project is finding new and efficient outlets to generate useful chemicals from components of biomass that are currently difficult to process.  While most biomass conversions are presently performed using catalysts and energy supplied by heat, this work is exploiting unique aspects of electricity-driven catalytic reactions in order to achieve synthesis of useful chemicals at low temperatures and pressures. The electricity required for these processes may, in turn, be derived from renewable sources such as wind and solar. A fundamental approach is being taken in which experimental techniques that probe the nature of the catalytic reactions are combined with computer simulations to build a comprehensive picture of the factors that govern reaction selectivity and to design more efficient processes. Insights from this work have broader application in extending the scope of green chemistry. This research is also being used to promote science education by involving undergraduate student researchers for summer internships, and the PI's are additionally developing a series of interactive educational modules related to understanding the physical processes governing electro-catalytic reactions. <br/><br/>     This project is investigating electrochemical control over selectivity in the conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks to desired chemical targets. Electrochemical conversions offer advantages in sustainable processing since they generally operate at low temperatures and utilize aqueous feedstocks directly.  Using selective oxidation of furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural over Pt electrodes as probe systems, this work focuses on determining the different mechanisms by which selectivity can be manipulated through control over electrode potential and composition. Mechanisms being explored include differentiation of charge-transfer reactions relative to neutral atom transfer reactions, variation in surface coverage of oxygen and organic species, and the role of promoters with specific reactivity or geometry. Three complementary research approaches are being integrated to characterize these effects. Measurement of electrochemical kinetics on metal catalysts is combined with in-situ spectroscopy to identify reaction pathways; surface science experiments are used on a model Pt(111) surface to study oxidation elementary steps in detail; and finally, density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the same surface chemistry, including simulation of electric potential effects and the water-metal interface. The three research thrusts provide complementary information and enrich the depth of understanding of the electrochemical environment.

One goal of this research is to elucidate feasible mechanistic pathways that explain experimental results. The high temperature reactions are relevant to the synthesis of materials such as carbon nanotubes; the lower temperature reactions are relevant to understanding the quantum chemical concept of heavy-atom tunneling, a fundamental aspect of chemical reactions.

At temperatures of 800-1200 C, reaction types of interest include hydrogen transfers, Stone-Wales rearrangements, and vinylidene insertions. The computational study attempts to place the various reactions on a common theoretical footing to compare relative rates and generate a unified picture of reactivity for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The work also aims to clarify structure-reactivity relationships, for example, by evaluating how the degree of curvature influences the different mechanisms for Stone-Wales rearrangement. At lower temperatures, pi-bond shifting in annulenes is known to be facile, and the research explores the contribution of quantum mechanical tunneling. The possibility that large numbers of carbon atoms are tunneling simultaneously are explored by comparing classical and quantum tunneling rates. The work addresses the scope of tunneling in organic reactions.

Both laser pump-probe methods and steady-state irradiation methods will be used to measure the cage effects in these systems.  Experiments are proposed to answer the following fundamental, as yet unanswered, questions.  1. Are cage effects more properly analyzed using solvent microviscosity rather than bulk viscosity?  2. What are the effects of radical mass, size, and shape on the cage effect in systems in which the two radicals in the solvent cage are not identical?  The answer to this question, when combined with the information learned during the investigation of question 1, will provide a quantitative predictive capability that can be applied to a wide variety of different radicals and solvents.  3. Does the cage effect depend on the excitation wavelength used to generate the radicals?  4.  Is the cage effect affected by tensile or shear stress on a molecule?"

In fact, ""fluorination screens"" have become commonplace in pharmaceutical chemistry. In this method, molecules are fluorinated methodically at each and every accessible site to render new candidates for evaluation. Thus, one very important goal is to place fluorine atoms in very precise positions within complex molecules - in short, achieving ""site selectivity.""  In this project, the P.I., Prof. Thomas Lectka of Johns Hopkins University, is developing methods to install fluorine in a site selective manner that would allow new and desirable passageways to large fluorinated bioactive molecules.  Simple reaction conditions, safety, and ease of use are important goals as well.  The fluorination of especially complex molecules, including natural products and peptides, is highlighted. These types of molecules are becoming of ever more interest to chemists.  In terms of broader impacts, Prf. Lectka has fostered a research group that contains predominately undergraduates.

Application 2 involves carboxylic acid derivatives (amides, lactams, and lactones) as directing groups for fluorination.  Once again, predictable site-selectivity is the paramount goal.  Application 3 is addressing strategies to render the site-selective reactions highly diastereoselective through the use of phase transfer catalysis, Lewis acids, chiral fluorinating agents, and a combination of the aforementioned strategies. The use of visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs), cheap photosensitizers and fluorinating agents is featured, and operational simplicity, mutual compatibility, mild conditions, and broad scope are fundamental goals as well.

The most basic electron and proton transfer reactions relevant to energy storage in chemical bonds are those involved in the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen. Man-made catalysts are not very efficient at accelerating this process, despite its relative simplicity. In contrast, living systems have evolved a class of enzymes called the hydrogenases that catalyze the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen at extraordinary rates and with little energy loss. The hydrogenases serve as ideal models for understanding the basic principles of efficient catalysis of multi-electron, multi-proton chemistry, which is important for a wide range of applications including generation of solar fuels. While the structures of hydrogenases are well established, their mechanisms remain poorly understood; indeed, although the chemical structures of the active site of the enzymes have been exactly reproduced in synthetic mimics, these mimics fail as catalysts, highlighting the importance of the protein architecture that surrounds the active site. The Dyer group uses unique laser-based methods to elucidate the dynamics and mechanisms of the electron and proton transfer processes and the role of the protein in controlling them.  This research helps students at all levels develop highly interdisciplinary skills and a knowledge base focused on renewable energy science. Training students in renewable energy science is accomplished through the Emory Chemistry Intern Program (high school students) and the Emory SURE and SIRE programs (undergraduates) with an emphasis on underrepresented minority students recruited from the Historically Black Atlanta University Center.  Professor Dyer's laboratory has a strong record of dissemination of cutting edge chemical techniques such as the laser induced T-jump methods now widely used in protein folding.<br/><br/>Hydrogenases exemplify the challenges inherent to mechanistic studies of the highly efficient oxidoreductases. These challenges are both practical, due to the difficulty of resolving the molecular processes for enzymes with kcat > 1,000 s-1, and conceptual, due to the complexity of the structures and dynamics that orchestrate the electron and proton transfer reactions. Because of the extraordinarily fast catalytic rates of these enzymes, their mechanisms have been difficult to study directly. The Dyer lab recently developed an approach that enables the study of the elementary electron and proton transfer steps during fast enzyme turnover.  The approach combines a laser-induced redox potential jump with time-resolved infrared spectroscopy studies of the enzyme active site. Using this unique approach, they investigate critical mechanistic questions for the hydrogenases, including how these enzymes move electrons and protons together to avoid high barrier traps (testing the principle of electroneutrality), what are the proton pathways and how are proton transfer and electron transfer gated, and what are the mechanisms of the reaction of molecular oxygen with the active site, enzyme inactivation, and reductive reactivation.

Appreciable advances have been made in recent years in the design of new molecular switches, integrating them into bulk materials, and applying them in new functions. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before such systems can find their way into real-life applications. This research addresses one of these issues, which is the lack of a basic understanding of how to make molecular switches and machines work together towards a useful goal - a solved problem in natural biological systems. To mimic Nature, the Aprahamian research group at Dartmouth College studies the interactions of molecular switches with their environment. This knowledge may lead to the engineering of dynamic, adaptive and self-regulating molecular assemblies that can be used in drug delivery and energy-related applications. The broader impacts of this research include participation in the American Chemical Society's SEED Program and other endeavors to help retain students at different levels of education (high school, undergraduate, and graduate students) in the sciences.  Professor Aprahamian also uses interactive demonstrations to educate the public about important concepts related to supramolecular chemistry. These activities are expected to strengthen and extend the group's informal and formal science education partnerships and networks with local schools and science museums.<br/><br/>With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, this research examines the coupling of zinc(II)-initiated, coordination-coupled, deprotonation (CCD) of hydrazone switches with other metals, particularly palladium(II).  These reactions extend the capabilities of currently known switching cascades and open the way for compartmentalization driven catalysis using self-assembled cages.  The Aprahamian group gains a deeper understanding of the factors that control CCD-enabled negative feedback loops and uncovers the underlying rules that lead to analyte regulation. Finally, the group develops new zinc(II) photocages/switches that can couple with CCD and feedback loops to enable the future design of oscillating systems, molecular clocks, and self-regulating assemblies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While for many applications, such a mixture does not impact the physical properties of the polymer, some applications require polymers to have strings of the same length to attain specifically-desired polymer properties. The research group of Professor Wei You at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill has discovered a new polymerization methodology for preparing polymers that have a narrow distribution of lengths. To further develop the methodology, this research seeks a better understanding of the polymerization process in order to achieve greater control of the lengths of such molecular strings.  The research also seeks to broaden the applicability of the synthesis methods to a wide range of different polymers. Education, collaboration, and outreach are integral aspects of this project. Professor You actively recruits students of underrepresented groups into his research group.  Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students receive training in cutting-edge small molecule and polymer synthetic methods, along with complex analytical techniques through engaging in this interdisciplinary research project. Professor You is actively involved in a number of outreach activities, including the UNC Science Expo (part of the North Carolina Science Festival).  This event is UNC?s single largest science outreach event, attracting approximately 10,000 participants annually. In addition, Professor You has also designed short lectures on polymer solar cells for high school students and teachers brought as part of the Climate LEAP program.<br/><br/>The classical living cationic polymerization achieves ""living"" characteristics via the equilibrium between the ionic (i.e., propagating chain end) and the covalent (i.e., resting chain end) species.  In contrast, the controlled cationic polymerization recently discovered in Professor You's laboratory proceeds through an entirely new mechanism - a cationic chain transfer mechanism, analogous to that of the conventional Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization. This research explores and elucidates the mechanism of this new cationic polymerization process.  The project investigates the mechanistic details of a new metal-free, protonic acid initiated and alcohol-mediated controlled cationic polymerization.  The researchers expand this unique living cationic polymerization into polymerizing various electron-rich monomers, and unveiling the roles of the applied photocatalysts in the controlled cationic RAFT polymerization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical catalysts increase the speed of chemical reactions.  Catalysts are commonly used for preparing important materials such as plastics and medicines. It is desirable to make catalysts with long lives to avoid the high costs and environmental problems associated with the metallic elements that are often used. In this research,  polymers supports (""plastic backbones"") are used to recover a catalyst from a reaction so it can be re-used. Varied separation strategies are developed, depending on the polymer support. In much the same way that oil separates from water, the polymer-supported catalysts developed by Professor Hobbs and his students are ""phase-selective"" so they physically separate from the products after facilitating a chemical reaction. This green chemistry approach avoids wasteful and time-consuming purification steps. Educational aspects of this project are aimed at broadening the scope of polymer science education at SHSU through the development of new experiments for laboratory courses as well as hands-on participation in the research lab by undergraduates. Additional societal benefits include the recruitment and participation of under-represented students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) in research projects and volunteer work as math and science tutors in the Windham School District, the public-school system for those incarcerated in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDJC).<br/><br/>Professor Hobbs and his students develop new polymer-supported ligands and catalysts which are nonpolar and phase-selectively soluble. These polymer-supported catalysts are prepared using a combination of ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).  These are all techniques that offer high levels of control over polymer architecture.  Specific goals of the project target polymer-supported salen, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and N-heterocycle-based ligands and catalysts. Professor Hobbs is further preparing the first examples of phase-selective single chain nanoparticle (SCNP) and unimolecular ligand/initiator system (ULIS) supported catalysts. Because of their non-polar phase selectivity, these catalysts may be recovered and recycled under simple liquid/liquid separation conditions, thus avoiding chromatographic purifications.

However, the lack of atomic precision during fabrication of nanometer-sized crystals restricts the ability to harness all the power of this broad and diverse class of materials. For example, a collection of real nanoparticles is always non-uniform and comprises particles with some variation in size within the group. Dr. Talapin is investigating how to eliminate this size variation and enable atomic precision in synthesis of nanoscale materials. Many practical applications, from flat-panel televisions to photodetectors and solar cells, will benefit from highly uniform, nearly atomically precise nanomaterials. Dr. Talapin is developing a technique called colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) to control the solution-based synthesis of nanomaterials using a sequence of two complementary self-limiting surface reactions. This concept is inspired by the success of gas-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is widely used in microelectronics and other fields. Dr. Talapin's research has broader societal impact since it is directly relevant to the development of new technologically-relevant materials and has the potential to solve a fundamental problem that limits the pace of development for this broad class of materials. Dr. Talapin mentors undergraduate and high school students by helping them gain research experience. An important aspect of his outreach program focuses on education enrichment via science clubs and science nights for the local underrepresented African-American and Hispanic K-12 populations on Chicago's South Side. This project also supports the development and distribution of nanoscience educational resources accessible to the general public on the Talapin Lab website at the University of Chicago. <br/><br/>Dr. Talapin of the University of Chicago is supported by the Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to develop colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) of nanoscaled materials with precise size dispersion. The project aims to eliminate inhomogeneous ensemble broadening by growing functional nanomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion, starting from atomically defined clusters of different technologically important materials. The polydispersity of nanomaterials originates from a weak size dependence of the free energy related to the addition or removal of individual atoms to/from a nanoscale object. In this case, size distribution can only be controlled by kinetic factors. Both theoretical modeling and numerous experimental studies show that it would be difficult to improve homogeneity significantly by only kinetically controlling reaction products. Dr. Talapin is working on a paradigm-shifting approach for colloidal synthesis of nanomaterials with minimal, ideally no, size distribution. The goal is to establish means to thermodynamically control nanomaterials synthesis using a sequence of two complementary self-limiting surface reactions. This concept is inspired by the success of gas-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD) widely used in microelectronics and other fields. Preliminary studies show that the ALD concept can be implemented in solution and, when applied to colloidal nanomaterials, enables layer-by-layer growth of crystalline lattices with close to atomic precision. Eliminating polydispersity at the ensemble level is arguably one of the most important challenges in nanomaterial synthesis. One can draw an analogy between size distribution of nanomaterials and the polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers. The discovery of advanced living polymerization techniques, which nearly eliminate chain polydispersity, has been among the most important recent developments in macromolecular chemistry. Dr. Talapin incorporates activities with broader societal impact into his research program.  He actively trains undergraduate and high school students in his lab by giving them research experience opportunities. He also develops course modules and nanoscience educational resources applicable to K-12 students which are accessible to the general public on the Talapin Lab website at the University of Chicago. These hands-on labs and experiments are also used in outreach and education enrichment events for the local underrepresented African-American and Hispanic K-12 populations in on Chicago's South Side."

Reactions involving the participation of light-absorbing organic aerosol components as photo-activators have been suggested as pathways for the photochemical origin and processing of important gas-phase species such as NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and O3 (ozone). This project uses a combination of theory and experiment to investigate chemistry inside aerosols.

This hypothesis is being tested her by a  combination of experimental and modeling approaches designed to gain the necessary molecular-level insight into photoactivated aerosol chemistry. Advanced spectroscopic techniques, laser flash photolysis, and computational chemistry will be used to create new knowledge of the systems of interest at the molecular level. Aerosol flow reactor experiments are to be used to quantify the kinetics of these processes under aerosol conditions.

It is a collaboration between Professors Jinyong Liu and David Volz at the University of California, Riverside, and Prof. Yujie Men at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Together with their graduate students they study perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). PFCs are a family of chemicals that have the same carbon backbone as hydrocarbons but all atoms attached to the carbon backbone are fluorine instead of hydrogen. Carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds are highly stable. Surfaces modified with PFCs are resistant to both water and oil. Thus, PFCs are widely used in fire-fighting foams, electronics, lubricants, outdoor apparel and equipment, and on-sticking cooking ware. The stability of C-F bonds makes PFCs also very difficult to degrade in the natural environment. Synthetic PFCs have been globally detected in the environment and living organisms. Bioaccumulation of PFCs has been connected to a variety of human health problems. However, current technologies are not effective in PFC degradation via breaking the C-F bonds (i.e., defluorination). Therefore, it is desired to develop both new PFCs that can be degraded more easily and new strategies for removing these compounds from the environment.   This research investigates the structure-activity relationships, reaction mechanisms, and products of cobalt-catalyzed removal of fluorine from of PFCs in abiotic and microbial environments. Outcomes may contribute to solving PFC pollution challenges by providing fundamental guidelines to the design of novel degradable PFCs and microbial remediation in natural environments.<br/><br/>This research employs a multi-faceted approach combining chemical and biological tools to investigate cobalt (Co)-catalyzed defluorination of PFCs. The team investigates the product of PFC defluorination after Co-catalyzed reactions. The structure-activity relationship between the Co coordination sphere in chemically and biologically synthesized complexes and the defluorination activity is investigated.  The redox environment enabling abiotic and microbial defluorination reactions is determined. Three PhD students receive interdisciplinary training. Undergraduate and high school researchers from a diverse student population are exposed to interdisciplinary training, specifically topics related of sustainability. The broad community is reached via a public-oriented science conference and other events.  Results may be applied to biomimetic catalyst system design, synthesis of novel fluoro-pharmaceuticals, and toxicology evaluation of novel fluorochemicals.

Converting the carbon dioxide to fuels and chemical products reduces CO2 emissions and provides an alternative source of carbon for fuels and chemical feedstocks. One way this can be accomplished is using electricity and a ""helper"" molecule known as a catalyst to find an energy efficient reaction path in a chemical process called electrocatalysis.  Two major challenges associated with electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are that the reactions are slow and that it is difficult to control the distribution of reaction products. In this project, Dr. Hailiang Wang is developing a new category of highly efficient catalysts for fast and selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons. The catalytic sites of these materials are molecular in nature, so that synthetic chemistry can be utilized to accurately tailor the catalyst structures. The structures are further optimized at one the billionth of a meter level (the nanometer scale) to enhance their catalytic performance. The catalysts are insoluble in the electrolyte solution so that they can be easily separated.

Transition metal catalysts are particularly useful in the production of bulk chemicals and fuels, and for cleaner fuel combustion and  pollution cleanup. For these solid catalysts, metals at the catalyst surface bind the reacting chemicals with just the right strength (or ""bond energy"") to enable their chemical conversion to the desired products.  Too tightly bound, and the product will not desorb but will remain attached to the catalyst surface.  Too weakly bound and the reactant will not adsorb, and cannot react catalytically with it.  Improving the energetics of such catalysts is essential for producing and using chemicals and fuels with higher energy efficiency and less pollution, as needed for sustainable living into the future.  The key to improving the catalysts is to find materials whose surfaces bind the reacting chemicals with the optimum bond energies.  In principle, this can be achieved by solving the equations of quantum mechanics (a branch of physics) with computers.  Unfortunately, the math is very difficult, so mathematical approximations must be made for even the fastest computers to solve the equations in reasonable times.  Experimental measurements of some of the bond energies are needed to compare to the computer results, to assess whether these approximations lead to incorrect bond energies.  In this project, Dr. Charles T. Campbell is measuring bond energies for selected chemicals bound to transition metal surfaces, carefully chosen to enable development of new quantum mechanical methods for more accurately predicting such energies, and to improve the basic understanding of the catalyst's action. Improving the energy accuracy of such fast computations is transformative in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling greater reliability in computer-based predictions of better catalyst materials. This research also provides strong interdisciplinary, research-integrated education for numerous young students, scientists and engineers, who get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art measurement instrumentation and its design.

This, in turn, improves the basic understanding of catalytic mechanisms, and facilitates the design of better catalysts. Dr. Campbell's calorimetric measurements, which cannot be performed with the same precision elsewhere in the world, are broadening the database of reliable experimental energies of adsorbed catalytic intermediates that can be used by theoreticians as benchmarks to guide development of computational methods with improved accuracy for calculating the energetics of chemical reactions at late transition metal surfaces.  While density functional theory (DFT) has been extremely successful in catalysis research, prior results proved that the mean absolute errors in the energies of adsorbed intermediates from DFT exceeds 20 kJ/mol. The experimental database being developed here greatly facilitates ongoing efforts by the theoretical community to improve the energy accuracy of such fast computational methods, while also clarifying the energetic basis for structure-reactivity correlations in transition metal catalysis. These improvements are transformative for catalysis research, enabling greater reliability in computational prediction of reaction rates and mechanisms, and higher success rates in predicting better catalyst and electrocatalyst materials that are essential for sustainable living.

Fors of Cornell University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry to develop new synthetic methods for the preparation of polymers with control over chemical structures and properties.  This approach takes advantage of interesting characteristics of visible light to enable the synthesis of previously inaccessible polymer architectures. The properties of polymeric materials are directly controlled by chemical structure and the methods developed in this project enable the synthesis and utilization of improved polymeric materials for applications in adhesives, elastomers, and electronics. Educational activities are integrated into this project.  The focus of these activities is on the development of a polymer science summer camp that exposes Native American students to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and research at an early age. The objective is to stimulate the interest of Native American students in STEM related fields.<br/><br/>The project develops a cationic polymerization process for vinyl ethers that is regulated by visible light through the reversible oxidation of a polymer chain end with a photocatalyst.  Precise spatial and temporal control over polymer chain growth is achieved by the photoinitiated reversible formation of a propagating cation.  This cationic polymerization process is being used in combination with other photocontrolled radical polymerization processes to enable switching between different polymerization mechanisms. Monomer selectivity in situ is achieved by modulating the wavelength of irradiation. This protocol provides control over polymer sequence with an external stimulus and allows the synthesis of previously inaccessible polymer structures. Additionally, similar strategies are being developed for photocontrolled polymerization of epoxides, thus extending the scope and expanding the practicality of this approach. Synthetic polymers are of importance in all aspects of modern life and have facilitated major societal advances. Innovative synthetic methods are required to enable the synthesis of complex materials with unknown function. Photocontrolled cationic processes allow for the development of new polymeric structures with previously inaccessible architectures. Importantly, high levels of spatial and temporal control gained in photocontrolled polymerizations facilitate the application of these new methods in fields such as lithography, coatings, and biology. This award enables the establishment of a polymer science camp on the Flathead Indian Reservation in collaboration with the Salish and Kootenai College. This summer camp introduces Native American students to research activities at an early age in order to increase their interest and participation in STEM fields. Additionally, through workshops for teachers on the Flathead Indian Reservation the quality of STEM related education increases for elementary and middle school Native American students. These efforts contribute to creating a diverse STEM workforce in the United States."

While catalysts for the conversion of CO to fuels containing carbon-carbon bonds are known, their reactions are chemically challenging and poorly understood. Dr. Agapie's catalysts are capable of forming products containing the desirable carbon-carbon bonds using CO as a starting material. He is also using these compounds to systematically study the relationship between their structure and reactivity in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the principles controlling their behavior.

Their small size gives them unique optical properties. When irradiated, they emit intense visible light in a color that depends on their size, shape and composition, making it possible to generate a rainbow of visible emission colors from a single semiconductor material. Luminescent semiconductor nanoparticles have found use in recent years in biomedical imaging and sensing applications, in light emitting devices including cell phone screens and flat screen TVs, and in energy converting photovoltaic devices.  Their distribution across a wide range of economic sectors has raised serious health and environmental concerns since these nanomaterials often contain cadmium, a highly toxic substance. Zeev Rosenzweig, at UMBC is developing novel synthesis, and surface modification methods to prepare a new generation of cadmium-free, and therefore non-toxic luminescent semiconductor nanoparticles made of indium phosphide (InP). Rosenzweig and his students also demonstrate the utility of InP nanoparticles as cellular imaging agents to study how enzymes work in living cells.

InP quantum dots, while non-toxic, currently have inferior photophysical properties and low chemical stability compared to cadmium-containing quantum dots. The objectives of these studies are to control the reaction conditions for InP (core) and InP/ZnS (core-shell) quantum dots formation using fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy measurements, to modify the surface of InP/ZnS in order to increase their chemical stability in the complex biological solutions, and to utilize them for quantitative imaging and sensing studies of key metabolic enzymes, phosphatases and protein kinases in living cells.

These organisms discovered a way to make their own food using the virtually limitless supply of water and sunlight available near the surface of the oceans.  As far as science knows, organisms have found only one way to perform this water oxidation process, and it is possible that modern plants and photosynthetic organisms are still using that same evolutionary innovation from billions of years ago, although presumably significantly evolved. The enzyme that performs this reaction is called Photosystem II, and despite the central importance of this reaction to the fields of biology and energy, many questions remain about how this enzyme works. Professor Zdilla is working to build molecular models of the enzyme active site, which is a cube-shaped cluster of metal atoms containing manganese and calcium. The working models developed by Professor Zdilla may lead to insights on how photosynthetic organisms are able to perform this important reaction. Professor Zdilla continues his community engagement of youth and adult communities through talks during the Philadelphia Science Festival and at Philadelphia elementary schools. Professor Zdilla also develops the Database of Educational Crystallographic Online Resources (DECOR), a free, downloadable source of educational materials for the study of crystallography. <br/><br/>The primary source of cellular energy on earth is the sun, whose visible light energy is harvested by photosynthetic organisms to drive the oxidation of water to O2 and drive the concomitant reduction of carbon dioxide(CO2) to organic molecules, which are then used as fuel and as raw materials for the construction of living things. Photocatalytic water oxidation coupled to proton reduction is also an important goal for the generation of sustainable solar fuels. The enzyme responsible for the biological water oxidation reaction is photosystem II (PSII), a multi-subunit enzyme containing a tetramanganese-calcium-oxo cluster as the catalytic active site. Since enzymes are often a challenge to study directly due to their complexity, bioinorganic chemists frequently turn to biomimetic model complexes. Despite hundreds of examples of synthetic manganese oxo-cluster, very few show compelling reactivity that models PSII. Professor Zdilla and his group develop new approaches to designing biomimetic manganese clusters by prioritizing low-coordination number(to provide water binding sites) and cluster flexibility (to promote molecular rearrangement). These approaches have resulted in clusters that perform a diverse set of difficult reactions including N-N, C-H, C-N, and O=O bond making/breaking reactions, and catalytic water oxidation. This project seeks to further mechanistically investigate their molecular mechanisms, which may inform understanding of the function of the enzyme, and provide clues on how to design superior water oxidation catalysts for energy purposes.

Catalysts are vital in many industrial and laboratory chemical processes. Many catalysts involve a metal atom that contains a reactive center that can facilitate chemical reactions. However, this reactive center, itself, can be prone to reactions that can deactivate it. This project involves the development of ligands (groups that are attached to a metal) that contain one portion that is firmly bonded to the metal and another that can be relatively easily removed from the metal to open a reactive site. These ligands are called hemilabile ligands. The hemilabile ligands targeted contain a group that can bind to an external positive ion that remove that group from the metal. This permits a balance of activity and stability that advances catalysis relevant to the pharmaceutical and commodity chemical industries. The educational approach focuses on communication in chemistry. Graduate students are participating in a science communication initiative in collaboration with a local science center, the Morehead Planetarium, creating hands-on activities that illustrate the role of catalysis in everyday life. The Safety Net is also being established as an online network of safety resources to encourage communication between academic and industrial scientists.  <br/><br/>The research approach utilizes new ""pincer-crown ether"" ligands that contain a macrocylic cation receptor site to modulate reactivity.

Professor Waterman is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Vermont. The objective of this proposal is to discover and understand catalytic reactions that form phosphorus-carbon and silicon-carbon bonds. Central to meeting that objective is utilizing abundant metals as catalysts to afford divergent chemical reactivity of phosphorus-hydrogen and silicon-hydrogen bonds with a variety of reagents. Two specific reactions will be explored: alpha elimination and hydrophosphination. Alpha elimination is a rare and relatively new reaction with the potential to facilitate the synthesis of complex molecular structures. These structures have applications in materials science, catalysis, and biomedicine. Hydrophosphination is a well-established transformation, but questions and limitations remain. Overcoming these challenges makes this reaction available for broader use in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, for example. Improved understanding in both reactions would advance the multi-billion dollar field of catalysis. Professor Waterman has been able to successfully recruit students underrepresented in the sciences, provide research experiences for high school students, and engage in educational outreach with K-12 students, practices to be continued in this project.   <br/><br/>The proposal explores two unique kinds of catalysis to understand and improve the catalytic preparation of E- carbon (C) (E = phosphorus or silicon) bonds, recognizing that abundant and inexpensive metals can be enlisted to produce divergent reactivity upon E-hydrogen (H) bond activation in the presence of unsaturated substrates. Through a series of testable hypotheses, a validated set of design features for alpha elimination catalysis is sought. This reaction may result in the efficient synthesis of phosphorus- and silicon-containing molecules via catalytic E-C bond formation is a key driver. Prior discoveries in this group demonstrate that such new reactivity is possible, and efforts in this area seek to improve understanding of M-E bonding and reaction chemistry. Efforts to discover new and highly efficient syntheses of chiral-at-phosphorus ligands though hydrophosphination provide a platform to address those fundamental issues and broaden the understanding and utility of this key P-C bond forming reaction. Beyond the benefit of these reactions to fields such as materials science, energy, and biomedicine, the outreach program includes direct research experiences for high school students in support of project goals."

This network combines the scientific expertise of four chemists, an environmental microbiologist, and a toxicologist to systematically design, synthesize, and characterize a wide array of new glycolipid surfactants. The recent discovery of a versatile, green synthesis of glycolipids is being leveraged to explore the synthesis of target glycolipids identified by computational methods to possess excellent surfactant properties in solution and at surfaces. The synthetic strategy involves univariate green metrics as quantitative benchmarks for assessment of improvements, including the use of renewable reagents from natural resources. Solution aggregation behavior of surfactants is characterized with a comprehensive suite of techniques to determine critical micelle concentration and aggregate shape and size, in part in collaboration with the National Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). The biodegradability of surfactants is determined, and the toxicity screening of potential candidates is carried out by a variety of chemical and biological assays. Attractive targets are screened in an in vitro model of ocular irritation. This effort will provide new insight into surfactant structure-function relationships and drive advances in molecular design. <br/><br/>Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid, the interfacial tension between two liquids or the interfacial tensions between a liquid and a solid.  Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents and dispersants.  These critical, ubiquitous chemicals are present in many consumer products and industrial processes, with a multi-billion-dollar market.  The toxicity of many conventional synthetic surfactants as well as their persistence in the environment are driving regulatory and consumer pressure to develop greener and more sustainable alternatives..

Dr. Stephanie Brock is investigating how to convert plentiful solar energy into electricity or chemical fuels.  She is particularly interested in the challenging problem of how to harvest ""light"". Quantum dots are very small particles that have dimensions on the order of 1/1000th of a red blood cell and are great at absorbing solar radiation and producing charged particles.  Accordingly, Dr. Brock is developing techniques that enable these sub-microscopic quantum dot particles to be assembled into films and 3 dimensional porous structures with millimeter to centimeter dimensions.  Dr. Brock is developing methods that enable quantum dots with different chemical potentials to attach to each other, thereby creating a voltage difference that can move an electrical current within the structure. She is also working to understand how the chemical nature of the inter-particle bonding affects the ability to rapidly move the charges, and how these charges can sometimes get ""trapped"" and resist extraction. This fundamental knowledge helps in the design of efficient solar cells and photochemical water-splitting (hydrogen fuel generation) systems.

The kinetic parameters dictating oxidative assembly of nanoparticles (made of MQ where M = cadmium, lead, zinc; Q = sulfur, selenium, tellurium) are studied as a function of the redox properties of Q, the solubility of M, the crystal structure of MQ, the facet energetics and the surface ligand group.  In parallel, methods for replacement of oxidized interfaces with metal-ion crosslinks by post-gelation oxidative addition reactions or (pre-gelation) assembly of sulfide or halide-capped nanoparticles via metal cations, are evaluated. The ability to control the rate of solution-phase assembly of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles, thereby enabling programmable assembly of disparate nanoparticle components into 2- and 3-D ""wired"" architectures with specified degrees of heterogeneity, enable design of multicomponent assemblies for applications that benefit from rapid injection of charges over short distances (e.g., photocatalysts prepared from homogeneous assembly of photosensitizer + catalyst) or require extraction over large distances (e.g., bulk nanoheterojunction solar cells comprising p + n semiconductors). Chemical principles are also employed to tune the nature of the interparticle interfaces, thereby augmenting interparticle transport and the overall stability of the assembly.

This developmental work is aimed at the study of protein complexes. Proteins play a crucial role in life processes. When such molecules do not form the correct three dimensional shapes, disease often ensues and therefore it becomes important to be able to determine the structures of these biological molecules and how their components come to form critical shapes. However, because of their relatively large sizes and other factors, it is difficult to determine accurate structures for many molecules. The new instrumentation and techniques developed by Professor Valentine are important ways for determining the structures of such proteins. Professor Valentine is also engaged in educational outreach efforts to improve the training of Middle- and High-School teachers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields thereby benefitting many students. <br/><br/>The characterization of protein complex structures as well as the structures of coexisting protein species presents one challenge to modern analytical techniques. Professor Valentine is developing novel gas-phase separation instrumentation and techniques to study these problems. This work has three major tasks. First, a hybrid drift tube that combines traditional ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separations with overtone mobility spectrometry (OMS) analysis is constructed and coupled with an existing linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The approach may allow the probing of minor conformational changes (~4%) occurring on very short timescales (microsecond and lower), enhancing current methods for structural assessments. Second, the novel technique is used to characterize a protein system associated with Huntington's Disease. Multimeric peptide ions formed by portions of the huntingtin (Htt) protein are subjected to OMS-hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) analysis with tandem mass spectrometry (MS). The results are compared with those obtained from IMS-OMS-MS analysis to provide a means for testing the new instrumentation and techniques on a real-world sample as well as provide new information in the form of species that are undergoing structural transformations during the course of the measurement. The final task is characterizing these same protein systems using solution-phase HDX combined with OMS-MS/MS studies to unravel linking of solution- and gas-phase structures as well as to provide information regarding conformation establishment in the gas-phase.  This research may provide important clues about Huntington's Disease progression.  The educational component establishes strategies for improving the efficacy of middle- and high-school science instruction, develops undergraduate curricula, introduces undergraduate students to research, and provides unique research and instructional opportunities for graduate students."

The proposal is jointly funded by the NSF EPSCoR Office and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.  Chiral objects are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (e.g., left and right hands).   Chiral molecules are ubiquitous in nature and chirality has profound implications in chemistry and biology.    Chiral molecules have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light and are said to be ""optically active"". Despite two hundred years of research from the first discovery of optical activity, we are still not able to understand the correlation between the molecular structure of a chiral crystal and its response to light. Dr. Caricato's research provides such deeper understanding through theoretical simulations.  The theoretical methods are being implemented in computer codes that will be available to the community as an open source computational module.  The methods will also be integrated into Gaussian, a very widely-used and well-maintained quantum chemistry software package.  This research may also lead to technological breakthroughs in materials science, as chiral materials are becoming increasingly popular for applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and electronics.   Dr. Caricato's outreach program aims to bring computational chemistry into the high school classroom in Kansas.  Computer simulations have enormous educational potential in this technological age, and the modules created by Dr. Caricato in collaboration with local high school teachers provide students with an active learning experience aimed at stimulating their enthusiasm for science and their interest in pursuing further training in STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/> The main goals of Dr. Caricato's project are: 1) to develop truly first principles quantum mechanical methods for the calculation of optical rotation (OR) in extended systems; 2) to investigate structure-property relations in ordered optically active materials. Measurements of the optical rotation tensor in solids are missing a physical interpretation based on theoretical simulations. This is a significant drawback as these measurements can explicitly provide the entire optical rotation tensor, and thus lend themselves to a direct comparison with calculations. This project aims to extend the predictive power of OR calculations with density functional theory from the molecular to the supramolecular scale. New approaches for qualitative analysis are being developed that will help reveal the elusive structure-property relations in optically active materials, both in terms of intra- and inter-molecular interactions. Moreover, Dr. Caricato's methods allow interpreting and predicting ECD spectra, which are a primary tool for the characterization of chiral self-assembled materials. Therefore, this project has the potential to significantly impact the characterization and design of such materials. Dr. Caricato's efforts may open new avenues for technological advances due to the increasing importance of supramolecular self-assembled chiral materials in electronics, molecular recognition, sensing, and chi optical switching."

The new methods enable simulations of molecules and condensed matter systems that are very difficult to treat with conventional approaches, for example rare-earth compounds or transition metal compounds used in catalysis.  Such systems are critically importance for science and emerging technologies.  A fundamentally different approach to electronic structure theory based on quantum fluctuations, proposed by Furche promises to overcome many of these limitations. The methods developed in this project are made available to the public through the Turbomole quantum chemistry software. The project enhances undergraduate education and workforce readiness through a new concentration in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at UCI and a high school outreach program aimed at students from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>Furche and his group are developing new methodology to enable predictive simulations of molecules and condensed matter systems such as small-bandgap or correlated materials and clusters, noncovalently bound nanostructures, or optical properties of transition-metal and rare earth compounds. Despite their critical importance for science and emerging technologies, these systems remain nearly intractable with conventional electronic structure methods, due to insufficient accuracy, computational efficiency, or both. Random phase approximation (RPA) methods developed during previous funding periods are the prototype fluctuation-based electronic structure theory. Guided by the successes and failures of RPA, Furche and his group are laying the groundwork for a systematically improvable hierarchy of electronic structure methods based on fluctuations. As opposed to the conventional approach to electron correlation in chemistry, which is based on interacting electron pairs, triples, etc., the methods proposed here describe correlation in many-electron systems by vacuum fluctuations generated by virtual pairs of electrons and holes traveling forward and backward in time (and multiples thereof).  Furche and his group also explore a Brueckner functional framework as alternative to Kohn-Sham reference states, and aim to extend the scope of RPA methods to ionization, time-dependent properties, and excited states. Applications include low-valent rare-earth and actinide compounds, and halogen-pi interaction mediated drug design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These bacteria are part of the gut flora or microbiome, a collection of microorganisms that live in the gut and have an influence on human health. The gut microbiome helps us digest food and fight pathogens, for example.  It takes 1-2 years from birth for babies to develop an adult-like gut flora. The human breast milk delivers molecules that promote or suppress the growth of specific gut bacteria to infants. About two hundred of these molecules are oligosaccharides.  The research of Dr. Townsend focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism by which oligosaccharides found in human breast milk affect the growth and virulence of a bacterium from the gut that is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis.  Successful completion of this project may help us understand human-bacteria communication and provide new strategies to control specific aspects of this communication. The interdisciplinary aspects of this program allows graduate students and undergraduates to gain expertise in modern research techniques. The project also integrates an outreach program to teach carbohydrate science to children at the Martha O'Bryan Center, an anti-poverty, non-profit organization in Nashville, Tennessee.<br/><br/>Human milk contributes substantially to the establishment of the gut microbiome in breastfed infants by providing >400 bacterial species and supplying components that promote or suppress the growth of select bacteria. One of these components are human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs).  The central focus of Dr. Townsend's program is to define how HMOs maintain microbiome homeostasis. Bioassay-guided fractionation is used to identify potent antimicrobial HMOs in human milk. Then, they use chemical synthesis to prepare photoreactive HMO probes. These probes are used in affinity-based protein profiling to discover the specific biological targets of HMOs and gain key insight into the mechanism of action of HMOs. The identification of the mechanistic targets of HMOs may significantly impact basic science by annotating, at the molecular level, the biochemical processes of HMO-based chemical signaling between humans and microbes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It represents a collaboration between Dr. Joseph Pignatello at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Professor Klaus Schmidt-Rohr at Brandeis University, and Professor Jingdong Mao at Old Dominion University. Together with their postdocs and graduate students, they investigate properties and behavior of biomass chars in the environment. Biochar particles are partially burned plant matter with blackened surfaces.  Char results from natural and deliberately-set fires and are common components of soil and aquatic sediments. Activated carbon (a form of charcoal) and biochar can be beneficial soil additives for use in agricultural processes. Important attributes of chars include their ability to strongly bind pollutant and to change the identity of the pollutant molecules. Air may be present or absent during the charring process. It is usually present during the weathering of chars in the environment. The oxygen in air can have major effects on the physical and chemical properties of chars and can impact their functions as materials that absorb and change pollutants. This research examines the absorption and change in pollutants on biochar surfaces using carefully controlled experiments at both room temperatures and higher temperatures. This project provides benefits to society by studying how biomass chars affect the fate of pollutants in the environment. It also provides valuable information that may be useful in efforts to clean up contaminated sites, as well as in agricultural applications. In addition to fostering the training of students and postdoctoral fellows, this project incorporates a visiting scholars program for PhD students and professors, an internship program for undergraduate students, an Honors College program to foster involvement of undergraduate students in active research, and mentorship programs for high school students. The project has strong outreach and education components directed at engaging prospective scientists among historically disadvantaged groups, especially at Old Dominion University, which is an urban campus with a significant minority population.<br/><br/>Biomass chars are ubiquitous components of soil and sediment from fires and also have attracted interest as soil amendments in agriculture and environmental remediation. Important attributes of chars include their ability to effectively adsorb organic and inorganic compounds and to mediate electron transfer reactions to/from or between organic species. Air present during or after pyrolysis can have major effects on the physical-chemical properties of chars that impact these functions, yet this subject has received<br/>little attention. The objectives of this project are to determine the underlying structural and chemical alterations of char caused by both thermal and ambient air oxidation (AO), and to determine the effects of these alterations critical to their interactions with emerging pollutants. In the laboratory chars are made from wood and switchgrass. The test compounds are phosphate, arsenate, arsenite, selenite, aquatic herbicides (diquat and paraquat), and model organic compounds. Advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is employed to identify and quantify changes in functional group composition and fused aromatic ring size. This also allows detection of signals coming from exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds formed between surface groups and weak acid adsorbates. NMR sensitivities are enhanced by using 13C-enriched switchgrass as the biomass precursor and 13C-labelled compounds as adsorbates. The project investigates the consequences of air oxidation on the formation of exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds. It also addresses cation exchange interactions, dissolved organic matter competition for adsorption sites, oxidation-reduction reactions mediated by chars, and the concentrations of persistent free radicals formed by the pyrolysis process. The findings are expected to provide novel insights for char structure and weak acid solute behavior in the environment.  The project has outreach and education components and aims to engage students among historically disadvantaged groups."

However, in many cases, understanding how one small defect in a battery or one muted DNA molecule in an animal behaves is vitally important. Professor Yan's technique is able to monitor molecules from an area of only a few nanometers cross where she can study chemical bonds and obtain chemical information of one or a few molecules involved.

For example, she is using her technique to sequence DNAs from a single neural cell to pinpoint gene mutations, which may shed light on brain disorders including autism or schizophrenia. Professor Yan is also interested in increasing the diversity of the US science and technology workforce by providing early exposure to scientific research to high school students in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California.

Her approach is based on a adiabatic plasmonic nanofocusing mechanism to concentrate light to, and extract signal from, a nano-confined Raman sensing volume with high efficiency and energy throughput. The key components of this project are: (1) simulation demonstration and experimental verification of the feasibility of the novel TERS platform; (2) integration of the TERS system with commercial AFM and STM systems, and develop protocols to evaluate and optimize its performance; and (3) application of the novel TERS platform to address practical issues in chemical analysis of complex surfaces in materials, catalytic, electronic and biological systems. In addition to bringing the developed technique to commercialization through industrial collaboration, Professor Yan also plans to actively engage students in research training and build STEM pipeline through (1) summer camps and research internship programs that provide local high school students with hands-on experience with modern optics and chemical research, and (2) an international student exchange program (with China) to provide UCR STEM undergraduates and graduate students with international research exposure."

Unlike ionic solids (such as table salt, Na+ Cl-), the fluid form of ionic liquids (also called molten salts) makes them potentially useful for a variety of technological applications, such as batteries, fuel cells and the solvents for the synthesis of other molecules.  Just as liquid water actually contains areas that are ice-like in their ordering, ionic liquids can also possess local ordering of ionic molecules.  The extent of ordering in ionic liquids influences their physical properties (e.g., density, viscosity, ability to conduct electricity).  Professor Sangoro and his team seek to understand how ions organize in the liquid state, how long the arrangements persists, and how these arrangements are changed by interfaces such as the ionic liquid-air interface, or the interface between the liquid and a metal surface(where the metal may be a catalyst or an electrode for chemical reactions). The Sangoro group uses x-ray and neutron scattering techniques and a technique called broadband dielectric spectroscopy to obtain information about the structure and behavior of ionic liquids. This information may aid in the development of new clean energy and battery technologies.  The main goal of the educational and outreach plans is to increase student interest in, exposure to, and preparation for careers in science and engineering, with specific focus on minority students. Professor Sangoro organizes mentored research experiences for high school students from underrepresented/minority and economically disadvantaged local groups, by first introducing engineering undergraduate students to research within the first two years of college.  The research group partners with established NSF-funded outreach programs at the University of Tennessee to attract and retain engineering students from underrepresented groups, providing new research and training opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in order to provide state-of-the-art research opportunities.  Professor Sangoro engages in individualized mentoring for selected K-12 students from underrepresented groups in the economically disadvantaged groups living in the East Knoxville area. This CAREER grant enables the research team to provide hands-on training to both graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students who may go on to become future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The project focuses on understanding the impact of mesoscale organization on interfacial ion dynamics in bulk and confined molecular ionic liquids. Upon systematic variation of the chemical composition of ionic liquids, the mesoscale organization and dynamics are probed by x-ray and neutron scattering, dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. These complementary techniques enable the correlation of mesoscale structures, and an understanding of their dynamics and the resulting physical and chemical properties of ionic liquids. The second emphasis of this research project is on elucidating the correlation between of mesoscale organization and dynamics within the electrochemical double layers in molecular ionic liquids. This effort involves development of a new theoretical model to describe the processes associated with accumulation of ions at interfaces between ions and solid electron conductors. The third thrust of the project focuses on experiments to understand the impact of geometric confinement on mesoscale organization and dynamics. To achieve this, silica nanopores with mean diameters as small as 4 nanometers are prepared through electrochemical etching and filled with systematic series of ionic liquids. The interactions between ionic liquids and the pore walls are intentionally varied while measuring the dynamics associated with the ions. The series of experiments and computations leads to a molecular-level understanding of the influence of mesoscopic organization on interfacial ion dynamics and transport in bulk and confined molecular ionic liquids. The fundamental understanding gained from these studies enables rational development of more efficient systems of ionic liquids for different applications including uses in electrochemical power sources and devices. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from an increased understanding of ionic liquids, as well as training of students and postdoctoral associates in fundamental science underlying many electrochemical energy technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Tao's work focuses on the family of theoretical methods known as ""Density Functional Theory "" (DFT).  DFT is widely used in the chemistry community because of its speed and ability to characterize the subtle interactions between electrons that determine the energy, shape and behavior of molecules.  However, the exact form of the theory is not known; all existing forms are approximations.  The goal of Dr. Tao's work is to improve DFT, so that it can make more accurate predictions.  The Tao group is applying their new methods to study the properties of organic materials used in electronic devices and solar cells. They are also studying the accuracy of their new methods for the description of transition-metal-based catalysts.  One broader impact of their work is a more general, accurate, and flexible form of DFT that can be applied by chemists worldwide, speeding the development of new molecules.  In addition, Dr. Tao is developing a summer workshop on DFT for undergraduates and graduate students in the Philadelphia area that helps inspire students to pursue work in the sciences, thus broadening participation.  <br/><br/>The accuracy of DFT relies on the approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. Development of the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density is the main task of this theory.  Existing functionals are accurate for many properties, such as bond lengths, lattice constants, and atomization energies, but they are often less accurate for band gaps, weak interactions, and reaction barrier heights. The Tao group is working to develop functionals with high accuracy for a broad range of properties by imposing the exact non-uniform scaling constraint on the Tao-Mo functional, and building electronic nonlocality into the Tao-Mo functional by developing local range-separated or hybrid functionals. They are also testing a functional constructed from a model for dynamic polarizability based on the local energy gap. Development of more accurate DFT methods for a wider class of problems may have broad impacts on chemistry, physics, and materials science.   In addition, Dr. Tao promote early in engagement by students in advanced theoretical methods through a summer workshop program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new approach enables better prediction of the transport and fate for many metals, but the focus here is on tungsten (W), recently declared an ""emerging contaminant of concern"" by the US EPA. This approach takes advantage of variations in the stable isotope ratios of tungsten (e.g., W-183/W-182), which are highly sensitive to differences in the numbers, lengths, and strengths of chemical bonds involving the metal atoms. Stable isotope systematics are used to probe the molecular-scale interactions between dissolved W and porous media at realistic concentrations in the environment, but inaccessible to conventional spectroscopic techniques such as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Concurrently, an innovative informational effort is launched at Indiana University to educate the campus community about where metals in everyday objects come from and what hazards and consequences are associated with taking those resources from the Earth. A series of signs are displayed on campus with quiz questions and QR (quadratic residue) code links that are developed by interns in IU's Office of Sustainability, with assistance from the Office of Science Outreach and Professor Wasylenki's research students.<br/><br/>Simple sorption experiments and precise isotope analyses yield quantitative information about isotope fractionation during sorption of W onto four common sorbent phases.  Studies are made first at high concentrations, where EXAFS provide information directly about coordination chemistry and sorption mechanisms, and then at field-relevant conditions, where isotopes may be the only way to constrain sorption mechanisms. Computational quantum mechanical modeling complement the experiments, isotope analyses, and EXAFS analyses.  The modeling studies predict the expected isotope offsets between monomeric and polymeric species of W, which form in solution and as sorbed complexes. The work advances what is known about the environmental chemistry of tungsten and enables stable metal isotopes to be used as a tool for tracking transport and fate of metal contaminants."

In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, a collaborative team of researchers at the University of Iowa, University of Washington at Tacoma and Seattle, University of California at San Diego, and Stony Brook University develops a predictive framework to help improve chemical risk assessment. Ultimately, outcomes of this project may produce more safe and sustainable water supplies, particularly as society becomes more reliant on reuse of treated wastewater to bridge the widening gap in supply and demand.

Focusing on a widely utilized abiotic treatment process, chlorination, and ubiquitous but understudied pollutant classes, potent synthetic progestins and glucocorticoids, this project develops a high-throughput framework built upon computational and experimental methods for the a priori prediction of high risk, bioactive transformation products. This approach integrates theoretical calculations to identify probable chlorination products using descriptors for both parent (partial charges, oxidation potentials) and likely product (thermodynamic stability) species. Potential product species are prioritized based on bioactivity (i.e., risk) using high throughput virtual ligand screening.  Once identified, the formation and yield of high risk products are evaluated in bench-scale experiments across a range of chlorination conditions.  High resolution mass spectrometric detection is used to examine wastewaters and receiving waters. Research outcomes may be used to predict emerging pollutants and provide a more holistic approach to addressing the risks posed by their bioactive products.

It can exist in one of two states, which are often called 'on' and 'off' states, or ones and zeros.  Quantum computers are different. The basic unit of information in a quantum computer is the qubit. However, unlike the bit in conventional computers, qubits can exist in many different states, which gives rise to the possibility of building powerful computers that can revolutionize science and technology.  However, creating qubits is challenging and oftentimes they persist only at very low temperatures.  Thus, realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing requires qubits that are simultaneously stable at room temperature and can be precisely manipulated and measured. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Daniel Lambrecht and Geoffrey Hutchison at the University of Pittsburgh are studying a new type of molecular qubit that could operate at much warmer temperatures and with much longer lifetimes when compared to current systems. The project's discoveries could facilitate a 'quantum leap' toward room temperature quantum computing that could have broad implications for materials design, drug discovery, machine learning, secure communications, and more. This work creates research and training opportunities for students at multiple levels, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate. Importantly, this work trains students at the interdisciplinary intersection of chemistry and quantum information science, as is crucially needed for a STEM workforce that can fully utilize the power of quantum computing.<br/><br/>This project employs theory and computation in tandem with experimental validation to study the electric-field gated inversion of bowl-shaped molecules such as ""buckybowl"" corannulenes and sumanenes as realizations of molecular electromechanical qubits. These ""nanobowl qubits"" have the potential to overcome limitations of current generation electromechanical qubits, specifically the requirement for ultra-low (mK) cryogenic operation and decoherence due to internal defects or qubit-bath interactions. Specifically, they: (i) offer greater than 100x increased temperatures for the quantum-to-classical transition, as compared e.g. to current generation suspended carbon nanotubes, (ii) reduce qubit-environment dipolar interactions and thereby enhance coherence lifetimes by more than 10x compared to current types of electromechanical qubits, and (iii) can be operated at electric field strengths realistically achievable in nanoelectronics. These characteristics address the main drawbacks of current electromechanical qubits. Research questions include: 1) Does the high zero-point energy of the nanobowl inversion mode facilitate significantly higher temperature operation? 2) How strong is the predicted entanglement between nanobowl qubits and what is their decoherence lifetime? Addressing these questions is giving rise to a proof of principle exploration of nanobowls as electromechanical qubits that are potentially orders of magnitude better than the current generation. A theory/experiment feedback loop is used to validate computational predictions and refine computational approaches, if necessary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the development of light rechargeable batteries as a cheap, practical way to capture and store the sun's energy for powering common electronic devices. The batteries are inspired by photosynthesis in plants which drives a fuel producing reaction called reduction via oxygen generation. For functional batteries to be produced, both of these types of reactions must be optimized and then combined with forward reactions representing charging, while the back reaction of the products serves as the discharge cycle. Possible reduction reactions targeted here produce hydrogen and metal products or compounds produced from carbon dioxide. To optimize the reduction, new catalysts and light absorbers are being designed to push the limits of performance and stability. On the oxidation side, the same kind of oxygen evolution in plants has already been widely studied, but here, work looks at a different chemistry, amine oxidation, as a potentially more practical alternative for use in a battery. This unexplored process can be established as a new tool for solar energy storage.  Because this research project is aimed at a critical societal challenge, it inspires students to gain chemical knowledge and to become involved in chemical research. Moreover, the Bernhard laboratory continues to reach out to and involve researchers from underrepresented groups in the fields of science, technology and engineering. Educational activities at the undergraduate and graduate student level focus on the theme of renewable energy while outreach activities for non-scientists both educate the public on energy issues and instill excitement for science in general. <br/><br/>Light to chemical energy conversion systems commonly comprise of a light-absorbing chromophore, a catalytic cycle producing reduced fuel, and a complementary oxidative cycle. Work proposed here aims to optimize these elements for unification in a solar rechargeable battery which can serve as a cheap, practical means of simultaneously capturing and storing the sun's energy. Such batteries would charge through solar driven forward reduction and oxidation while back reaction of the products would enable discharge. Work towards new batteries builds upon previous efforts in the Bernhard lab which have pioneered the use of Ir(III)-based chromophores as highly efficient drivers for photo-induced water and metal ion reduction. In the established schemes, these chromophores pass excited electrons to a reduction catalyst or substrate while receiving electrons from a sacrificial amine. This amine then undergoes irreversible C-N bond dissociation prohibiting any back electron transfer. However, translating this system to a rechargeable battery means that the amine donor must be designed to not suffer oxidation-induced degradation while still preventing back reaction. To this end, amines are being pursued with reversible electrochemistry as well as an oxidized form which is heavily stabilized via deprotonation and aromatization for prevention of back electron transfer. Initial electrochemical studies on amines pinpoint promising structures with suitable oxidation potentials. Subsequent studies in a galvanic cell then insure that the stable oxidized form of the amines can be reduced back to their original structures. Champion donors are ultimately utilized in systems where their oxidation is unified with a photo-induced reduction reaction producing metal or hydrogen fuel. Nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopy are used to carefully monitor the fate of the amine upon illumination. While ongoing efforts are largely focused on amine oxidation, water oxidation is still a desirable counterpart for reductions in solar fuel schemes. Thus, some work is aimed at developing families of Ir(III) catalysts for water oxidation. The oxygen product of this reaction is a strong oxidant, so catalysts are being designed specifically to resist ligand oxidation for a longer lifetime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research project involves the use of fluorine nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR), a versatile analytical tool in chemistry used for probing chemical structures and geometries. Naturally-occurring, magnetically-active isotopes of elements such as deuterium (a form of hydrogen), carbon (C-13) and nitrogen(N-15) are most commonly studied in biomolecular NMR; however, fluorine (F-19) is a very attractive and sensitive nucleus, which offers rich information about molecules in the solution and solid states. The overall goal of this research program is to establish fluorine-19 NMR spectroscopy as a versatile approach for describing the structure and geometry of proteins. The project involves an integration of computational and experimental approaches. The broader impact plans integrate scientific training with studies in the humanities in an effort to prepare students for communicating science to the public. In addition, there are educational activities that involve a graduate student exchange program between the laboratories of the academic researchers and industry collaborators at Bruker. These students spend 2-3 weeks acquiring complementary training in advanced experimental biophysical chemistry, hands-on NMR spectroscopy, and instrumentation. Outreach activities for undergraduates and high-school students attract students with diverse backgrounds into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. <br/><br/>The specific objectives of this project are to develop fluorine-19 chemical shifts as a probe of geometry, electronic structure, chemical reactivity, and dynamics in peptides and proteins. The project integrates fluorine-19 solution and solid-state NMR parameters with quantum chemical calculations. The research exploits the vast range of chemical shifts and the sparsity of fluorine-19 sites, to develop solution and solid-state NMR experiments for mapping out long-range distances and interaction sites in peptides and proteins. The research may overcome the current challenges in the calculations of accurate fluorine-19 chemical shift tensors for biochemical systems and in fluorine-based distance measurements. Given the simplicity of biosynthetic incorporation of fluorine into a wide variety of specific and unique sites, the approaches enable fluorine-19 solution and solid-state NMR applications for a broad range of biochemical systems."

The formation of such bonds by facile oxidative transformations is a well-recognized process in biological systems. Such routes often introduce functionality at non-functionalized centers, thereby eliminating the need for complex pre-functionalized starting materials. To achieve these goals, individual reaction steps will be studied using stoichiometric conditions in order to understand the principles governing novel reactivity and selectivity. <br/><br/>The chemistry studied will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent in combination with less toxic and less expensive base metals.  Successful development of the methodology will have a broad impact as there is an important need for synthetic methods in areas ranging from the pharmaceutical, chemical, materials science, and agricultural industries to basic biological and chemical research endeavors. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Broadening the participation of underrepresented populations in chemistry research is a particular focus with support for the newly established Association for Cultural Diversity (ACDC) in Chemistry at Penn.

As the United States seeks to enhance its energy security through identification and development of clean energy sources a range of technologies need to be leveraged in order to secure a sustainable energy supply.  Electrochemical devices are an important part of this mix of technologies, and among these, fuel cells constitute some of the cleanest and most sustainable technologies. Several key hurdles to harnessing the potential of fuel cells (as well as various other electrochemical technologies) remain to be surmounted.  The team of investigators are focusing on anion exchange membrane fuel cells that have advantages over other types of fuel cells in not requiring precious metals and being operable with a variety of fuels at low temperature. The project is employing a cohesive strategy involving mathematical and computer modeling of specific materials components that may, in turn, guide the synthesis of new materials, the characterization and testing of these materials in actual fuel cells, and the determination of optimal design principles to govern future materials engineering in this area. The project is also providing education and training for graduate and post-graduate researchers in both theoretical and experimental aspects of materials science and engineering, thus ensuring the competence and creativity of the next generation of STEM researchers. <br/><br/><br/>The understanding and design of cost-effective and reliable polymer architectures for use as ion-conducting membranes is an important challenge facing emerging electrochemical device technologies. Currently available proton exchange membranes are problematic due to high cost, environmental concerns of fluoroplymers, and often poor performance under nonideal conditions. Additional challenges in proton exchange membranes fuel cell applications include difficult water management due to electro-osmosis, high fuel crossover, and the requirement of expensive platinum catalysts. Fuel cells based on anion exchange membranes have the potential to alleviate most of these problems. However, little systematic knowledge of how best to design these materials exists at present despite the fact that liquid-electrolyte alkaline fuel cells were among the first fuel cells to be developed. The team of researchers is applying an integrated, iterative theoretical-experimental approach towards the targeted syntheses of polymers, the first-principles computer simulations of specific polymer chemistries, the mathematical and experimental characterization of structures/morphologies, and the measurement and computational modeling of long-range hydroxide ion transport.  Through this cohesive effort, the team of investigators is aiming to advance fundamental science and engineering knowledge in the area of fuel cells membranes and to deduce a set of fundamental design principles for anion exchange membranes that accelerate the time between concept and production of practically useful materials."

However, we are increasingly unable to meet this need, and water scarcity is now considered one of the most serious global challenges of this century. A key problem is the lack of low-cost and high-efficiency technologies for water purification. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Drs. Vojislava Pophristic and Zhiwei Liu at the University of the Sciences are designing highly permeable and selective water channels that will significantly improve water filtration by allowing the passage of water, while blocking salts and other impurities. The channels are cylindrical hollow helices that are formed by assembly of specific chemical building blocks. The group first designs the channel on the computer by creating and optimizing the building block sequences. The promising candidates are then made in the laboratory and tested by experiments. This project is a training ground for students at a science-focused university, a community college and one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).<br/><br/>The project builds upon the group's development of computational approaches for accurate structure and dynamics prediction of arylamide foldamers. The arylamide scaffolds form stable single or duplex helices of application-appropriate lengths and inner cavity dimensions. The modularity and tunability of arylamide foldamers make them excellent candidates for the design of water transport channels by mimicking structural characteristics of aquaporins. The group designs water channels by establishing sequence-structure-function relationship using rational and combinatorial sequence generation and molecular dynamics simulations, followed by optimization for selectivity. The project includes an international collaboration with Dr. Ivan Huc, who experimentally verifies computationally obtained structures and measures water/ion/proton conductivities. An important aspect to this project is that it helps us understand naturally occurring filtration processes, such as selective water transport by aquaporins, which play a critical role in human health."

Martens of the University of California, Irvine is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop computational methods to simulate quantum processes in molecular systems.  Ordinary Newtonian or classical mechanics is used to understand the motion of everyday objects such as golf balls or airplanes. Very light particles such as electrons, however, must be described using quantum mechanics.  The motion of atoms and electrons that accompany chemical reactions falls in the frontier separating classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of matter.  Martens and his research group explore this frontier by incorporating quantum effects into the conceptually intuitive and computationally efficient framework of classical mechanics.  They focus on nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules, where quantum electronic transitions accompany the nearly classical vibrations and chemical rearrangements of the constituent atoms.    Martens' goal is to gain an understanding of the nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level while at the same time developing methods that are more efficient and accurate than existing approaches.  Their research activities are paralleled by an outreach program that includes mentoring undergraduate and high school students to write educational computer games that add quantum effects to familiar but inherently classical gameplay to illustrate quantum mechanics in a manner that is accessible to nonscientists, and even to children. <br/><br/>Martens and his group are developing a new stochastic surface hopping approach that captures quantum nonlocality and coherence fully and accurately in a classical trajectory context.  Unlike current methodology, the novel approach describes quantum properties of the system such as the populations, coherence, and the partitioning of energy collectively through interrelationships between the trajectories of the ensemble taken as a whole.  Martens and coworkers aim to achieve a quantitatively accurate trajectory-based method for simulating molecular dynamics with electronic transitions within this framework, both as a fundamental achievement and as a benchmark for the introduction of further approximations.  Ultimately, they seek accurate but economical and efficient methodologies based on well-understood and tested compromises rather than ad hoc simplifications.  They are constructing an independent trajectory approach incorporating rigorously derived quantum generalized forces that avoid ad hoc features of standard methodology with the goal of broader applicability while being roughly equal in cost.  The Martens group is pursuing extensions to multidimensional systems, where energy partitioning and geometric phase effects provide challenging tests of the new approach.  In addition, Martens is implementing an outreach program that bridges the gap between performing arts and science, with the goals of enhancing the image and accessibility of science as a career.

With this information in hand, it is possible to develop a set of rules for the design of molecules (ligands) capable of specific binding interactions with other target molecules (receptors). DNA has long been viewed as an important macromolecular target for the binding of small molecule ligands, and indeed there are numerous examples of natural and designed molecules that associate with the minor groove of DNA. However, no general paradigm currently exists for the design of major groove-binding small molecules.

The project also provides hands-on training in organic synthesis, molecular spectroscopy and microcalorimetry for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the project may lead to new procedures and protocols that can be adapted for use in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory curriculum at Northridge, which is expected to increase student interest in interface sciences such as chemical biology, bioorganic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.<br/><br/>Bicyclic aryl C,O-glycosides are naturally occurring molecular wedges that may be used as rigid intercalating scaffolds to position functional groups in proximity to the discriminatory edges of the A/T and G/C base pairs in the major groove of DNA.

Analytical laser spectroscopy techniques, in particular infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and two-laser pump-probe schemes in a cryogenically-cooled 3-D ion trap, will be employed to: 1) provide a deeper understanding of labile and radical rearrangement chemistries that take place, 2) study the dynamics of these rearrangement reactions, and 3) develop methodologies that enable more control in the dissociation chemistry, for improved structural determination of peptides and proteins.  The proposed research is of significance to de novo protein sequencing and for the location of posttranslational modifications on the peptide sequence. <br/> <br/>In the course of this research, graduate students are being trained in state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques.  The technologies and the results of the proposed research will be communicated to high school students through workshops  aimed at high school science teachers."

This requires control over not only structure, size and shape but also chemical composition. In this project, methods are being developed for patterning metals into nanoscale objects by using chemical reagents and electrons. Students involved in this project present their work at scientific meetings and publish papers in peer reviewed journals.  They also have the opportunity to conduct experiments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, broadening their educational experience while enhancing opportunities for future career placement. To communicate the excitement of science to the general public, participants in the project are generating a series of 90-second ""Tiny Tech"" radio modules and podcasts that feature real world applications of chemistry and chemistry-based nanoscience. <br/><br/>Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a promising nanofabrication technique that can create metal-containing nanostructures for photonics, catalysis, sensing and plasmonics.  In this technique, electrons are used to induce local decomposition of organometallic precursors adsorbed onto solid substrates in a vacuum environment. FEBID combines the advantages of direct-write lithographic processes (e.g., high spatial resolution, site-specificity, mask-less, resist-less) with the flexibility to deposit materials on non-planar surfaces, allowing creation of spatially and geometrically well-defined three-dimensional, metal-containing nanostructures. For FEBID to emerge as a broadly applicable nanofabrication technique, however, control must be exerted over not just the size and shape, but also the chemical composition of the nanostructures. The current practice is to use precursors designed for thermal processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These CVD precursors generally create FEBID deposits with high levels of organic contamination, limiting potential applications. This project is addressing the issue of contamination in FEBID materials.  This research synthesizes and evaluates new organometallic precursors designed specifically for FEBID.  The efforts are guided by mechanistic insights from surface science.  They are also improved by developing new purification strategies for FEBID nanostructures. The results are improving the understanding of FEBID by generating detailed mechanistic information on the electron-molecule reactions. Careful design of the reaction chemistry allows control of the purity while the ability to focus electron beams allows control of the size and shape of the metal structure in a process analogous to 3D printing of plastic objects."

In so doing, existing synthetic methods are pushed to their limits by their use in very challenging contexts, and novel chemical reactivity is uncovered and utilized. The results of these studies positively impact any area of applied science that benefits from chemical synthesis, including pharmaceutical development, materials science, and more. This grant also supports outreach activities to middle school students from underserved communities to engage in scientific experiments on-campus, and simultaneously learn about the college experience.<br/>  <br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of several strategies for the rapid buildup of the molecular architectures of four different types of complex natural products. The Himbert intramolecular arene/allene cycloaddition reaction and the resulting strain-driven rearrangement of the cycloadducts, transformations that have both previously been carefully investigated in these laboratories, are being leveraged in a concise synthesis of a small family of alkaloids. A combination of an arene-terminated cation-pi cyclization, a bioinspired A-ring cleavage, and a cycloaddition of a novel cumulene equivalent Diels-Alder dienophile set the stage for a rapid synthesis of a complex diterpenoid. An underutilized heterocycle annulation is leveraged to synthesize a structurally unique antibiotic alkaloid. Finally, either a concise and unusual but potentially biogenetically relevant route or a more conventional approach facilitate the first synthesis in an unusual family of complex alkaloids.

For many downstream applications - displays, lighting, solar cells, transistors, and sensors - the three-dimensional (3-D) arrangement of organic molecules in processed thin (10-1,000 nanometer) films dictates device performance. This study is developing a general self-assembly approach to allow functional organic molecules to form useful superstructures in a self-guided way.  In the broadest sense, the work contributes to a general understanding of how to control the 3-D structure of single and multi-component organic matter at the nano-/mesoscale.  Broader impacts with respect to education and training come from (1) graduate and undergraduate students being exposed to multidisciplinary science that includes synthetic and physical organic chemistry, spectroscopy, computation, materials processing/characterization, and device fabrication; (2) the student participants, together with the UF Chemistry Club, disseminating standards-aligned experimental modules to K-8 classrooms that embed concepts of the chemical/materials sciences and their own research; and (3) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research activities.   <br/><br/>While it is known how to tailor the electronic and optical properties of individual pi-conjugated molecules as well as to program the arrangements of the molecules in solution, a major bottleneck for their usage is predicting and controlling three-dimensional morphological structure in thin films.  This research examines a hierarchical self-assembly approach based on hydrogen bonding to create nanoscale to mesoscale order in thin films of pi-conjugated oligomers irrespective of pi-chromophore structure.  The design involves covalently linking typical pi-conjugated components to molecular recognition units capable of directing their supramolecular assembly into predictably shaped aggregates.  The resulting topologies are expected to uniquely support the natural segregation of appropriately shaped additives in thin film blends, and allow desirable optoelectronic properties to be achieved.  The proposed bottom-up self-assembly approach effectively decouples the morphological structure of organic semiconductor thin films from the intrinsic optoelectronic structure of the constituent pi-conjugated chromophores, allowing these aspects to be independently optimized through rational/theory-guided material design.  The specific aims of this collaborative project include modular design and synthesis of pi-conjugated oligomers, evaluation of optoelectronic structure and (supra)molecular ordering in solution and in thin films, and characterization of the optoelectronic properties of and bulk ordering within the thin films using diagnostic devices."

The research infrastructure is being enhanced through scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>The research has three complementary components. First, the macroion-counterion interaction is being characterized by determining the radial distributions of counterions around macroions and the stability of the macroions in the presence of an excess number of counterions. Secondly, the effect of co-ions on the macroions are being examined, particularly for the preferential interactions between chiral macroions and chiral co-ions. Third, the detailed changes of surface water structures of both counterions and macroions during their interaction are being studied. Relatively simple models, mainly polyoxometalate clusters and metal-organic nanocages, are employed for the study. The solution studies employ a combination of techniques, such as static and dynamic laser light scattering, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, and Zeta potential analysis.

Professor Cyren Rico from Missouri State University and colleagues Richard Biagioni, Robert Pavlowsky, Gary Michelfelder and Melissa Remley have acquired an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The ionization using an inductively coupled plasma allows detection of metal ions and several non-metals present in very small concentrations. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. It is used by many students, some underrepresented in science. Fields of study include analytical, environmental, geochemical, and agricultural sciences.

Fraser of the University of Virginia is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the luminescent (light emitting) properties of materials based on difluoroboron beta-diketonates, a family of organic responsive dyes. The many different ways by which these dyes respond to changes in their environment in solution, organized media and the solid state are being investigated.  These responsive dye materials change color when scratched, crushed or smeared, and can self-erase with time. As such, they can find use as sensors, optical memory materials, security inks, intelligence contexts, pigments for art and other products.  Students from diverse backgrounds obtain multifaceted training in a multidisciplinary environment, engage with a network of local, national and international collaborators and learn science communication skills. Outreach towards K-12 schools is established through ties to a local high school science teacher.  An interdisciplinary ""Real World Chemistry Lab"" is under development to engage students, faculty and the community in chemistry and materials related issues relevant to society.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to explore responsive properties of difluoroboron beta-diketonate and bdk dyes in different environments and to consider ways to harness these properties for applications. Informed by computation, this is accomplished by preparing material sets designed to modulate luminescence properties in solution, nanoscale lipid assemblies and molecular solids. Dyes with donor-acceptor substituents, molecular rotors, lipids and other organizing groups are synthesized. Optical properties (emission, lifetime, quantum yield, ultrafast photoluminescence decay) are measured in solution and compared to computed spectra and frontier molecular orbitals. Solvatochromic and viscochromic effects are probed, relevant to investigations with liposomes, membranes and mechanistic probe development. Aggregation induced emission studies characterize the transition from solution to the solid state, whereas dye/polymer blends probe solid-state solvatochromism (dielectric, polar dopants, dye-dye interactions), rigidochromic effects (polymer glass transition temperature, crystallinity), and ML mechanisms, and are readily processable for potential uses. Powder and single crystal XRD provide information about order, dye-dye interactions, and molecular structure, whereas AFM reveals crystallinity and thin film morphologies in molecular solids. Dye assemblies are modeled computationally. Super cooled liquids are investigated by DSC, and mechanochromic properties of dyes are studied for thin films on weigh paper and glass along with new substrates with promising behaviors. A laptop/RGB camera imaging system will characterize dynamic optical effects such as ML recovery, supercooled liquid crystallization, and other luminescence changes in films and assemblies. The expected outcomes of this research are greater fundamental understanding of boron and diketone dye properties in solution, organized lipid media and the solid state. This will lead to more rational design of stimuli responsive, luminescent boron and diketone materials for imaging, sensing and detection applications."

Energy can be produced through different pathways in cells. How the traffic of fuel through these pathways is directed is still unclear. Evidence suggests that mitoNEET, a novel iron-sulfur containing human protein, regulates the flow of fuel through different pathways in a tissue specific manner. This role directly links chemistry of iron-sulfur proteins to the life process of energy generation. Our integrated approach combines techniques from biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioengineering to address the role of mitoNEET in cells. Students are acquiring training in protein expression, genetic engineering, and cellular imaging provided by the three participating laboratories.

The central hypothesis of this project is that the oxidation state and association of mitoNEET with dehydrogenase enzymes constitutes a tissue specific link between cellular energy metabolism and iron redox chemistry. In three different cell types, the cellular distribution of oxidized and reduced mitoNEET is characterized with the use of Raman interferometry. In addition, the impact of mitoNEET binding on allosteric control of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and the cellular functions of cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are characterized through a range of cellular experiments.

The Reisler group is particularly interested in hydrogen-bonded complexes of molecules and nanoparticles in water containing a few molecules of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and organic molecules such as benzene or phenol.  Hydrogen bonds are formed from the attraction of partially negatively-charged atoms such as oxygen on one molecule and the partially positive charge of a hydrogen atom on a neighboring molecule. Hydrogen-bonded networks influence chemical and biological function and are implicated in the identity of icy bodies in the solar system. Hydrogen bonding is not yet well understood because of difficulties in defining the experimental conditions. Professor Reisler overcomes these challenges by selecting water aggregates that contain a specific number of solute molecules, then uses laser techniques that have high detection sensitivity for the molecules and reactions of interest. The broader impacts of the project include potential societal benefits arising from better understanding the effects of hydrogen bonding on the reactivity of molecules in the atmosphere and other water-rich environments, like the human body.  Students and postdoctoral researchers build advanced instrumentation, preparing them high technology careers. Professor Reisler, a leader in mentoring of women in science fields, continues her activities in encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<br/><br/>The current research focuses on three topics: (1) energy flow pathways in the predissociation of dimers of water with aromatic molecules;(2) measurements of hydrogen-bond dissociation energies in cyclic trimers and tetramers with specific HCl and water subunits; and (3) interactions of nanoscale water samples with protons.  By recording images of specific rovibrational levels of one fragment of the dissociated cluster, the rovibrational energy distributions in the cofragments are determined, demonstrating how geometry and hydrogen-bonding type influence energy disposal. This provides stringent tests of theories and proposed mechanisms.  In order to study the emergence of acidity in condensed phase aggregates, nanofabricated arrays of gold nanoparticles are covered with solid water and rapid heating is achieved by visible irradiation that excites the plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticles. A 0.5 mm diameter laser pulse excites over a million nanoparticles.  The effect of a single laser pulse on solid water doped with HCl is studied using isotope exchange to probe acidity."

In solar-to-fuel reactions, a molecule is excited by absorption of light, and this process allows the molecule to transfer of both electrons and protons to another molecule.  A quantitative and predictive understanding of these reactions is hampered by the lack of efficient and accurate theoretical approaches.  The Huo group develops new quantum dynamics methods that aim to address these theoretical challenges.

Accurately performing such simulations remains a significant challenge in theoretical chemistry, due to a lack of efficient quantum dynamics methods as well as the discrepancy between diabatic dynamics methods and adiabatic electronic structure calculations. To address these long-standing challenges, Dr. Huo and his team are developing new path-integral quantum dynamics approaches that can accurately simulate non-adiabatic electronic transitions and explicitly incorporate nuclear quantum effects through a classical-like description for all degrees of freedom.  They are also developing new propagation schemes that enable a seamless interface between diabatic dynamics methods and adiabatic electronic structure calculations, explicitly avoiding additional efforts to reformulate diabatic dynamics methods to the adiabatic representations.

Together, Professor Tsige and his students are using the computer model to elucidate the mechanism of assembly formation and understand the effects of charge density, charge distribution, macroion size, and solvent polarity on self-assembly behavior.

The investigator also interfaces with several industrial partners to provide the undergraduate researchers with industrial laboratory experience.<br/><br/>In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program, Dr. Mikhail Zamkov of Bowling Green State University focuses on the synergy of novel synthetic strategies and ultrafast spectroscopy techniques to explore a new class of photocatalytic materials utilizing composite colloidal nanostructures. The proposed nanomaterials combine several inorganic domains in a single nano-reactor designed to efficiently convert the solar radiation into a catalytically active state. The key innovation of the nanomaterial architecture lies in the plasmon-assisted light-harvesting scheme, which takes advantage of the strong electro-magnetic field that exists in metal nanoparticles to boost the production of excitons in the surrounding semiconductor shell. The excitation energy of the shell is then relayed to suitable oxidation/reduction catalysts on the surface.  To ensure that different constituents of the composite nano-object work seamlessly, inter-domain interfaces are grown using molecular epitaxy. Such stoichiometric bonds, either covalent or ionic, reduce the density of defect states that dissipate the excitation energy enabling a high throughput of the absorbed radiation. The catalytic performance of the investigator's colloidal nanostructures are tested using common redox reactions in aqueous media, while the energy transfer processes are investigated using ultrafast spectroscopy techniques.  As an active member of Building Ohio's Sustainable Energy Future and Science, Engineering & Technology Gateway Ohio programs, Professor Zamkov involves small teams of undergraduate students in this research project, introducing them to general concepts in ultrafast spectroscopy, material science, and chemical synthesis. Special efforts are made to involve minority students and students from underrepresented groups.  Professor Zamkov also interfaces with several industrial partners to provide the undergraduate researchers with industrial laboratory experience."

It represents a collaboration between Dr. Joseph Pignatello at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Professor Klaus Schmidt-Rohr at Brandeis University, and Professor Jingdong Mao at Old Dominion University. Together with their postdocs and graduate students, they investigate properties and behavior of biomass chars in the environment. Biochar particles are partially burned plant matter with blackened surfaces.  Char results from natural and deliberately-set fires and are common components of soil and aquatic sediments. Activated carbon (a form of charcoal) and biochar can be beneficial soil additives for use in agricultural processes. Important attributes of chars include their ability to strongly bind pollutant and to change the identity of the pollutant molecules. Air may be present or absent during the charring process. It is usually present during the weathering of chars in the environment. The oxygen in air can have major effects on the physical and chemical properties of chars and can impact their functions as materials that absorb and change pollutants. This research examines the absorption and change in pollutants on biochar surfaces using carefully controlled experiments at both room temperatures and higher temperatures. This project provides benefits to society by studying how biomass chars affect the fate of pollutants in the environment. It also provides valuable information that may be useful in efforts to clean up contaminated sites, as well as in agricultural applications. In addition to fostering the training of students and postdoctoral fellows, this project incorporates a visiting scholars program for PhD students and professors, an internship program for undergraduate students, an Honors College program to foster involvement of undergraduate students in active research, and mentorship programs for high school students. The project has strong outreach and education components directed at engaging prospective scientists among historically disadvantaged groups, especially at Old Dominion University, which is an urban campus with a significant minority population.<br/><br/>Biomass chars are ubiquitous components of soil and sediment from fires and also have attracted interest as soil amendments in agriculture and environmental remediation. Important attributes of chars include their ability to effectively adsorb organic and inorganic compounds and to mediate electron transfer reactions to/from or between organic species. Air present during or after pyrolysis can have major effects on the physical-chemical properties of chars that impact these functions, yet this subject has received<br/>little attention. The objectives of this project are to determine the underlying structural and chemical alterations of char caused by both thermal and ambient air oxidation (AO), and to determine the effects of these alterations critical to their interactions with emerging pollutants. In the laboratory chars are made from wood and switchgrass. The test compounds are phosphate, arsenate, arsenite, selenite, aquatic herbicides (diquat and paraquat), and model organic compounds. Advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is employed to identify and quantify changes in functional group composition and fused aromatic ring size. This also allows detection of signals coming from exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds formed between surface groups and weak acid adsorbates. NMR sensitivities are enhanced by using 13C-enriched switchgrass as the biomass precursor and 13C-labelled compounds as adsorbates. The project investigates the consequences of air oxidation on the formation of exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds. It also addresses cation exchange interactions, dissolved organic matter competition for adsorption sites, oxidation-reduction reactions mediated by chars, and the concentrations of persistent free radicals formed by the pyrolysis process. The findings are expected to provide novel insights for char structure and weak acid solute behavior in the environment.  The project has outreach and education components and aims to engage students among historically disadvantaged groups."

Mansoorabadi from Auburn University, whose research project is focused on mechanistic and biosynthetic studies of dinoflagellate bioluminescence. Dinoflagellates are an important group of microorganisms found in freshwater and marine environments. Certain dinoflagellates produce potent toxins and cause red tides, which have a significant negative impact on coastal ecosystems and the health of humans and marine wildlife. Several species of dinoflagellates are both photosynthetic and bioluminescent, and are responsible for the bright blue glow of the sea. Dinoflagellates produce light in response to physical agitation using an enzyme known as dinoflagellate luciferase. The substrate of this enzyme, luciferin, is produced from chlorophyll by an unknown pathway. This research project aims to provide a better understanding of the dinoflagellate bioluminescence system by elucidating the mechanism of light production by dinoflagellate luciferase and the biosynthetic pathway for the production of luciferin. These studies help facilitate the use of dinoflagellate luciferase as a cellular imaging agent, and may lead to the development of algicides for the remediation of coastal seawater. This project also integrates bioluminescence, an exciting and fascinating natural phenomenon, into two K-12 outreach initiatives designed to attract and inspire young students to pursue careers in science and related fields.  It will also include students in the Auburn University Summer Science Institute directed at gifted high school students and the AU Explore a program that engages middle school students from predominantly rural schools<br/><br/>Dinoflagellate luciferase is a model system for the study of both pH-dependent enzyme regulation and the chemical mechanism of biological chemiluminescence, neither of which are well understood. To gain insight into the regulation of dinoflagellate luciferase, the magnitude and timescale of the pH-induced conformational change and the associated variations in structure and dynamics is determined using time-resolved photothermal methods, constant pH molecular dynamics simulations, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The detailed mechanism by which dinoflagellate luciferase produces light is investigated by determining the structure of the luminophore and other key catalytic intermediates using a combination of transient kinetic and spectroscopic methods and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. In addition, the identity of active site residues important for substrate binding and  catalysis is ascertained using mutational analysis. Finally, insight into the pathway of chlorophyll catabolism leading to the formation of dinoflagellate luciferin is obtained through the biochemical and structural characterization of identified biosynthetic intermediates and enzymes. Together, these studies provide significant insight into the biochemistry of these important marine microorganisms and  afford excellent interdisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students."

A key goal is to understand the role played by electron spin on the properties of the materials.  Electron spin state is important as it relates to the interaction of molecules with light because it determines the efficiency in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and in solar cells.    The effect of metals such as platinum, selenium, and tellurium on the electron spin is also being investigated. The project is being carried out by a team including undergraduate and graduate students with emphasis on participation by underrepresented groups.  An international collaboration is included with a group at the King Abdulla University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. The project is expected to have broad impact because the organic semiconductors that are the focus of these studies are being used to develop plastic electronic materials used in flexible light emitting devices and displays, solar cells, sensors and radio frequency ID tags.  Thus, the basic science being developed under this grant may have long term implications in technology development for the national health, defense and security sectors.<br/><br/>The project will initially involve the chemical synthesis of new semiconducting organic, organometallic and polymeric materials. Second, the properties of the new materials will be characterized by various techniques, including measurement of their light absorption and light emission characteristics.  Specifically, pulsed laser techniques will used to understand the time evolution of the intermediate excited states that are formed upon light absorption by these new semiconducting materials.  These experiments will be carried out on timescales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds.  The results will be interpreted within new or existing physical chemical models, enabling the assignment of the electronic spin state characteristics of these intermediates.  This should permit the development of quantitative structure-property relationships which relate the molecular and polymer structure to how the systems interact with light energy.

A pressing challenge facing society is the development of sustainable energy sources. In this context, hydrogen emerges as a possible clean alternative to carbon-based fuels, if scalable and environmentally friendly methods for its production and utilization can be developed. A potentially cost-effective and environmentally sound route to hydrogen can be gleaned from nature where a family of specialized enzymes called hydrogenases catalyzes proton reduction as well as hydrogen oxidation under mild conditions, using non-precious metals such as iron at the active site. Unfortunately, hydrogenases are large, complex proteins with several drawbacks that prevent their utilization in applications. Professor Ghirlanda designs and optimizes synthetic miniaturized proteins that contain artificial organometallic sites that are capable of proton reduction to molecular hydrogen. The presence of the organometallic unit is augmented with state-of-the-art methods to optimize the environment and long-range interactions in the protein scaffold, in an effort to obtain good rates of hydrogenase activity. This approach provides a means to test natural hydrogenase mechanisms while generating blueprints to develop novel enzymes. The project relies on a highly interdisciplinary approach that offers students at the graduate and undergraduate level a rich training in modern bioinorganic chemistry. In partnership with the Solar Utilization Network (a student-led organization that conducts science workshops in schools throughout the Phoenix area), Dr. Ghirlanda develops teaching modules designed to adhere to the Arizona sixth grade science standards and to introduce concepts related to sustainable energy in the classrooms.<br/><br/>Bioinspired organometallic complexes have clarified many mechanistic aspects of proton reduction, but have not reached the efficiency of natural hydrogenases due to limitations on the incorporation of second-sphere and long-range interactions. Here, Dr.  Ghirlanda and her group examine a hybrid system by which the chemistry of simple, relatively inefficient organometallic centers are enriched through second-sphere and long-range interactions provided by a protein scaffold. Their unique strategy is built around the use of unnatural amino acids that can coordinate and stabilize bioinspired organometallic catalysts. Using this strategy, nascent hydrogen production by small peptide-based model systems in water at near-neutral pH have been demonstrated. This project now (1) expands synthetic methodologies to prepare a family of artificial amino acids, (2) develops prototype de novo-designed artificial hydrogenases, and (3) uses computational protein design concomitantly with directed methods to optimize second coordination sphere and long range interactions. The development of evolvable protein-based hybrid catalysts capable of producing fuel in a sustainable manner directly addresses an urgent global need. Beyond hydrogen production, this project establishes a procedure to develop hybrid catalysts that may be widely applicable to a variety of chemical reactions, including those not occurring in nature, with the potential to impact the production of high-value chemicals."

Bacteria form three-dimensional communities, termed biofilms, in response to environmental signals, which protect the bacteria from predation and environmental stress. To understand how bacteria sense and respond to their environment, a detailed knowledge of the environmental signals, proteins, and pathways that affect bacterial growth, metabolism, and biofilm formation is required. The results from the proposed research will elucidate the role of oxygen concentration in controlling bacterial phenotypes, determine the molecular mechanism of oxygen sensing, and potentially highlight novel methods to alter oxygen-dependent signaling. The broader impacts emanate from teacher-scholar activities, which are integrated into the research plan. These activities will pique student interest in the scientific process and encourage students to pursue and remain in careers within the sciences. Proposed activities include 1) mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, 2) development of an undergraduate chemical biology class to introduce students to the primary literature and grant writing, and 3) establishment of two new organizations at Emory, a graduate chapter of Advancing Women in Science and an undergraduate Chemistry research honor society.<br/><br/>This research project is centered on determining the mechanism of signal transduction and the role of globin-coupled sensor signaling in diverse bacteria. Globin-coupled sensors (GCS) are heme-containing signaling proteins proposed to serve as oxygen sensors in vivo. A number of GCSs are predicted to contain diguanylate cyclase domains, which catalyze production of c-di-GMP, a bacterial second messenger that regulates biofilm formation. To understand complex, heterogeneous biofilms found in the environment, the factors regulating biofilm formation, such as gaseous environment, must be understood at both the molecular and organismal level. Although putative oxygen-sensing GCSs have been identified in the genomes of many bacteria, the mechanism of signal transduction within the protein, the role of the middle domain, and the downstream effects of oxygen signaling are poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria sense oxygen levels will help to illuminate how bacteria respond to changing environmental conditions and potentially allow for reengineering of these pathways. The aims of this research proposal are to 1) investigate the ligand-dependent activity of GCSs with varying middle domain lengths from diverse bacteria, 2) identify the mechanism of signal transduction and role of the middle domain, and 3) characterize interacting partners and downstream phenotypes controlled by GCS signaling in vivo. By understanding the effect of varying oxygen levels on bacterial phenotypes at the molecular level, it will be possible to elucidate the role of GCSs in oxygen-dependent biofilm formation and metabolic changes in a wide variety of organisms.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences"

Professor Timothy Hanusa of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University explores the extent to which common metals can replace rare-earth metals in various applications. The rare earths have hundreds of uses in medicine, electronics, and chemistry. However, they are expensive and at present there is no active source of these elements in the United States. This has resulted in uncertainties over the future supply and availability of the rare earths. As a consequence efforts to develop replacements for the rare earths is a strategic priority. This project targets the development of compounds that contain aluminum, calcium, or strontium (common inexpensive metals) and whose behavior resembles that of the rare earths.  This is done using a unique technique called mechanochemistry to prepare normally inaccessible compounds of the three metals. In mechanochemistry reagents are ground or ball milled together without solvent. Because these compounds lack solvent, rare earth like behavior can be induced in them. These are then developed as replacements for rare earths in a various applications. An additional advantage of mechanochemistry is that no solvent must be disposed of and, consequently, there is less chance for pollution. The project also provides research opportunities for a variety of students including women, underrepresented minorities, and both middle and high school students.  Such training and development of students is critically important for preparing the next generation of domestic science and technology personnel capable of competing in the global marketplace. <br/><br/>This project emphasizes the use of sterically bulky allyl ligands that are compatible with a wide range of metals and possess high conformational flexibility. In conjunction with the solventless synthesis, these ligands stabilize complexes with low coordination numbers and corresponding high reactivity. The new compounds are studied with NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and density functional theory calculations. The most promising are tested for their catalytic polymerization activity. The broader impact of the research includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and participation in various educational and outreach programs involving Vanderbilt during the academic year and summer. These activities encourage the students to participate in multiple areas of modern science."

At these high temperatures, chemical degradation can happen at an accelerated rate, leading to decreased efficiencies and, ultimately, process failure. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for sustainable operation as well as those that compromise performance is critical for designing new, durable chemical systems capable of electrochemical power generation. Professor Walker and his students are working to expand the use of state of the art spectroscopy techniques to identify and quantify the chemical reactions responsible for energy conversion processes. In addition to providing interdisciplinary research experiences to both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project, Professor Walker actively reaches out to students from underrepresented minority groups through the Montana Apprenticeship Program (MAP) and American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) Office on campus and works with student volunteers to help organize and judge elementary school science fairs throughout the Bozeman Public School District.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Walker employs second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study phase changes and surface chemistry for complex, mixed valent metal oxides commonly used in thermal solar and solid oxide fuel cell applications. Specifically, resonance enhanced second harmonic generation (SHG) is used to examine the surface properties of ceria, yttria, nickel oxide and other materials at temperatures above 600 C and under strongly oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. SHG is a well suited for stand-off, noninvasive studies of materials in chemically aggressive environments. SHG signal can arise from bulk materials that lack inversion symmetry but the surface contribution can still be extracted through analysis of the signal's phase and wavelength dependent resonance behavior. Resonance enhancement ensures the chemical (or material) selectivity necessary for answering specific questions about oxidation states, phase formation, and mass transfer. These studies could significantly expand the window of chemical systems capable of being studied with surface specific, second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy. The goals of this work are two-fold: 1) developing and applying second-order NLO techniques to study high temperature surface chemistry, and 2) testing proposed mechanisms that describe material segregation and new phase formation with a particular emphasis on reversible and irreversible changes in electrochemically active ceramic electrodes. Professor Walker's research program actively supports aspiring scientists from underrepresented groups in science. He engages students from underrepresented minority groups in his research projects through the Montana Apprenticeship Program (MAP) and American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) Office on campus.  His outreach activities are structured to provide a platform for his students to develop strong communication skills and mentoring abilities."

This instrumentation may aid in studying materials used in the development of sustainable energy which is a ""Grand Challenge"" for science and technology in the 21st century. To meet this challenge, innovative basic research into new solar energy conversion concepts, materials and technologies is needed. This requires highly multidisciplinary research efforts that span the biological, chemical, physical and computational sciences. The successful development of advanced functional materials requires understanding of fundamental processes involved in the interconversion of light, electrical, and chemical energy in materials, catalysts (enzymes) and at their interfaces.  Probing these fundamental processes requires advanced spectroscopic techniques with sufficient time, spectral and spatial resolution and tunability. The requested spectrometers and associated user facility provide this capability and greatly enhance solar energy research and training of postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate and graduate students at Emory and nearby institutions in the metro Atlanta and southeastern USA, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).<br/><br/>The spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. The instrument is used in a variety of investigations such as the examination of the giant oscillator strength transition effects in colloidal, two-dimensional cadmium chalcogenide nanoplatelets of relevance in energy research; studies of exciton dynamics in two-dimensional, transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures; and the determination of mechanisms of light-driven hydrogen-generating reactions in nanocrystal/hydrogenase hybrid photocatalysis. The spectrometer is also used in investigating the mechanism of triplet Dexter energy transfer in quantum dot/conjugated polymer complexes and in studying the mechanism of plasmon-induced hot electron transfer at a metal/semiconductor interfaces."

These particles are made of zinc oxide (ZnO) needles, a highly active material, used to speed up (catalyze) reactions when exposed to light.  The needles are grown around a spherical core that have the ability to form suspensions in both water-loving and water-hating liquids.  The main advantage of particles with a surface of nanospikes is their ability to disperse and conduct reactions in water-hating solvents while retaining their water-loving surface states.  In most cases, nanoscale photocatalysts improve efficiency and selectivity, reduce energy costs and simplify manufacturing operations for many important industrial processes.  Many nanoscale photocatalysts work only in water and other polar solvents important starting materials and reaction products are only compatible with nonpolar (water-hating) solvents.  The ability of nanospiked particles to perform photocatalysis may improve the efficiency of plastics manufacturing.  These materials may also open up new reaction pathways and improve the chemical and pharmaceutical production.  During the course this research, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in advanced research methods in nanoscience and catalysis. A collaborative program with science and art teachers in the Ypsalanti, Michigan area school district is established to devise new teaching and learning projects that combine art and science to help promote interest in nanoscience and technology.<br/> <br/>The omnipdispersive nanospiked particles are synthesized by growing ZnO nanorods on silica, alumina and titania microscale cores. The utility of these catalytic particles in organic solvents with respect to conversion rate and selectivity are tested for the photooxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, which are the key precursors for the large scale production of many common polymers.  The reaction mechanism and kinetics are investigated.  In addition, detailed experimental and theoretical modelling studies are conducted to arrive at a basic understanding of the catalytic activity of nanospiked particles and to develop an engineering foundation of inorganic, colloidal, heterogeneous photocatalysts."

This requires control over not only structure, size and shape but also chemical composition. In this project, methods are being developed for patterning metals into nanoscale objects by using chemical reagents and electrons. Students involved in this project present their work at scientific meetings and publish papers in peer reviewed journals.  They also have the opportunity to conduct experiments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, broadening their educational experience while enhancing opportunities for future career placement. To communicate the excitement of science to the general public, participants in the project are generating a series of 90-second ""Tiny Tech"" radio modules and podcasts that feature real world applications of chemistry and chemistry-based nanoscience. <br/><br/>Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a promising nanofabrication technique that can create metal-containing nanostructures for photonics, catalysis, sensing and plasmonics.  In this technique, electrons are used to induce local decomposition of organometallic precursors adsorbed onto solid substrates in a vacuum environment. FEBID combines the advantages of direct-write lithographic processes (e.g., high spatial resolution, site-specificity, mask-less, resist-less) with the flexibility to deposit materials on non-planar surfaces, allowing creation of spatially and geometrically well-defined three-dimensional, metal-containing nanostructures. For FEBID to emerge as a broadly applicable nanofabrication technique, however, control must be exerted over not just the size and shape, but also the chemical composition of the nanostructures. The current practice is to use precursors designed for thermal processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These CVD precursors generally create FEBID deposits with high levels of organic contamination, limiting potential applications. This project is addressing the issue of contamination in FEBID materials.  This research synthesizes and evaluates new organometallic precursors designed specifically for FEBID.  The efforts are guided by mechanistic insights from surface science.  They are also improved by developing new purification strategies for FEBID nanostructures. The results are improving the understanding of FEBID by generating detailed mechanistic information on the electron-molecule reactions. Careful design of the reaction chemistry allows control of the purity while the ability to focus electron beams allows control of the size and shape of the metal structure in a process analogous to 3D printing of plastic objects."

For example, the members of this collaborative research team seek to attach photoactive oligonucleotides to CdO:Dy films using new SAM chemistries and monitor binding simultaneously using fluorescence and mid-IR plasmonic detection. Heretofore, such strategies have generally not been seen using conventional plasmonic materials such as gold nanoparticles that quench fluorescence events. The team is also exploring new plasmonic oxides other than CdO with promising mobility and surface chemistry properties. The experiments include thin film preparation by molecular beam epitaxy and sputtering, film characterization by diffraction, infrared-ellipsometry, and electronic transport. Surface functionalization of these layers utilizes approaches based on chemical attachment with and without ultra-thin interface layers prepared by atomic layer deposition."

These new chemical entities feature unusual properties in their interaction with light, the binding of ""guest"" molecules within their cage-like structures, and their ability to serve as precursors for polymeric materials (plastics). One broader impact of this research is the possible development of new building blocks for the parylene industrial polymerization process that provides polymer coatings for sensitive devices and electronics.

This research seeks to advance these methods and to convert the self-assembled thiacyclophanes, which are known precursors to hydrocarbon cyclophanes, into new cyclophane compounds through three primary aims.  The researchers expand methods to synthesize new 2D and 3D self-assembled discrete disulfides using soft metal ions as directing elements. They also apply sulfur-extrusion chemistry to ""kinetically trap"" new thioether and hydrocarbon cyclophanes. Finally, the Johnson group scales-up the syntheses of new (hetero)cyclophanes and studies their initial properties.

The surface of aerosol particles is the first species encountered by molecules approaching the particles from the gas phase in processes leading to particle growth and subsequent cloud formation.  The particle surface is a challenging region of matter to access experimentally because it is thin and very reactive. The team specifically probe aerosol particle surfaces, the particle bulk, and the gas phase and then focuses on identifying chemical compounds residing at the boundary between the gas and particle phases of atmospheric aerosols. The team also determines how these surface compounds promote or disrupt particle growth and their propensity to form clouds. The synthesized compounds are available to the research community, enabling new collaborations that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The field of atmospheric chemistry requires a workforce trained in crosscutting disciplines. The collaborative training provided by the project addresses that need through interdisciplinary research activities. The proposed activities are also integrated with a meaningful focus on diversity. Rigorous training and mentoring experiences for graduate students includes research rotations at Northwestern and Harvard Universities, formal training in grant proposal writing, cross-disciplinary training in synthetic chemistry and spectroscopy, aerosol sample collection and analysis, and participation in community outreach programs. The proposed activities are fine-tuned by regular assessment and evaluation.<br/><br/>This research project tests the hypotheses that the growth of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles and their propensity to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) can be significantly influenced by surface chemistry. The hypotheses is tested by synthesizing both deuterated and unlabeled isoprene and -pinene and their oxidation products in pure forms, preparing SOA particles from these precursors, and (3) obtaining through measurement surface- and bulk-specific spectroscopic, chemical, and mechanistic information for determining how the surface-localized species contribute to SOA growth and CCN activity.  The research includes new synthesis and measurement approaches that reveal unique physical insights of how particle surface chemistry matters for particle growth under varying conditions of relative humidity and particle size. The following overarching five science questions are addressed: Which organic species partition to the surface of SOA particles? What are the residence times of the surface-localized species, and to what extent does diffusion of the interfacial species occur into the bulk particle phase? Do gas phase species adsorb reversibly or irreversibly to the surfaces of SOA particles?  Which surface species increase CCN activity by acting as a surfactant pool?  Do some surface species present a barrier (attractor) to further particle growth and thereby inhibit (spur) further particle growth?"

The goal of this research is to develop environmentally friendly catalysts using earth-abundant metals that can more easily generate a particular type of reactive intermediate known as a free radical, while also harnessing their reactivity in a controlled and selective fashion. An integral part of this program is the inclusion of underrepresented groups in this research, including high school, college, and graduate students. Professor Nagib's research team seeks to simultaneously increase interest, participation, retention, and literacy in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields by (a) offering hands-on research experience via a summer internship program for a diverse group of high-school and undergraduate students; (b) sharing interactive science demonstrations with local K-12 students; (c) creating informative and accessible visual media for the general public; and (d) sharing knowledge and research about radical chemistry through social media, online forums, and community outreach activities.<br/><br/>This integrated research, education, and outreach program is focused on enabling a complementary class of polarity-reversed, radical reactivity for carbonyls. The transformation of this ubiquitous synthetic handle from its native, electrophilic nature to an umpolung, nucleophilic ketyl radical is achieved through an anomeric activation strategy. This approach relies on in situ conversion of carbonyls to alpha-oxy intermediates, which are better suited for radical generation using mild catalysts derived from earth-abundant metals. This dual-catalytic strategy for generation of ketyl radicals is superior to current approaches that rely on strong, stoichiometric reductants to overcome the high reduction potential for single electron transfer (SET) to carbonyls. This technology has broad applicability for the development of sustainable tools for streamlining the synthesis of complex medicines and materials.  Integrated outreach activities involving multimedia demonstration of the vital role of free radicals and organic chemistry in daily life is also a key aspect of this funded project."

This approach integrates (i) theoretical calculations to identify probable chlorination products using descriptors for both parent (partial charges, oxidation potentials) and likely product (thermodynamic stability) species. (ii) Potential product species are prioritized based on bioactivity (i.e., risk) using high throughput virtual ligand screening.  Once identified, formation and yield of high risk products are evaluated (iii) in bench-scale experiments across a range of chlorination conditions and (iv) via high resolution mass spectrometric detection in wastewaters and receiving waters. Research outcomes ensures that when emerging pollutant classes are inevitably regulated, a more holistic approach is available that also addresses risks posed by their bioactive products.

Organometallic chemistry is the study of compounds that contain metal-carbon bonds and many advances in pharmaceuticals, materials, and fine chemicals are based on organometallic chemistry. While the behavior of uranium has been studied for many years, its organometallic chemistry remains quite limited. In general, metals can form one, two, or three chemical bond to carbon. This study prepares compounds containing uranium carbon double bonds and investigates their reactivity. Building on these findings compounds with uranium silicon and uranium-nitrogen double bonds also are prepared. These studies lay the ground work for the future development of new applications for uranium. In addition, the project trains undergraduate and graduate students in uranium chemistry. This is extremely important as the uranium chemistry workforce is aging and very few young scientists currently receive training in the field. Prof. Bart and her students also organize a science summer camp for high school teachers where they aim to give the teachers new skills in uranium chemistry through hands on activities and the design new demonstrations. <br/><br/>Using sterically bulky hydrotris(dimethylpyrazoly)borate as supporting ligands, uranium bis(alkys) are formed as used as synthons to prepare uranium-alkyledene, -silene, and -imido complexes.

Protein coacervates have been linked to many important biological processes and are also known to be key components of moisture-resistant adhesives produced by marine organisms, which have applications in medicine as surgical sealants.

Dr. Michael Gonsior and colleagues at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborate with Dr. Susan Richardson at the University of South Carolina. They study the formation of chemical compounds that arise during disinfection of seawater, which is required before water can be used in major desalination plants in the U.S. and Australia. Desalination is an important method for turning salt water into drinkable (potable) water in many parts of the world. It is becoming an increasingly important treatment technology as freshwater supplies are becoming scarcer. However, currently potentially harmful organic compounds produced during disinfection treatments are discharged into the aquatic environment in the waste water stream. The consequences of these organic compounds to aquatic organisms are largely unknown. This study provides new knowledge regarding the formation of previously unknown disinfection by-products (DBPs) produced during desalination. New quantification methods for organic compounds in aqueous environments are also developed. Undergraduate students are exposed to this research through internships, such as through the Maryland Sea Grant REU program and at USC. The CBL Visitor Center host displays about seawater DBPs, how they are formed and what impact they may have on the coastal ocean. In partnership with the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory Visitor Center, the research team hosts a summer workshop for 7-12th grade school students/teachers. The investigators also collaborate with colleagues in the U.S, Australia, and Germany, including industry partners from major desalination plants.<br/><br/>Future reliance on desalination and water reuse to provide suitable drinking water is expected globally.  During the desalination process, chlorination of water is required to limit biofouling of membranes and to kill potentially harmful bacteria. The formation of Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water chlorination and the compounding factors presented by different sources of fresh water, such as high levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM), is well recognized. However, during the chlorination of seawater, hundreds of brominated and iodinated compounds are formed, few of which have been characterized, and some of which are already known to be highly toxic. The researchers utilize new analytical techniques to investigate the production, fate and toxicity of DBPs in the coastal environment. Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has been utilized to describe complex organic matrices at the molecular level, and has successfully demonstrated the complexity of DBPS formed after chlorination of ship ballast water as well as characterizing DOM in natural waters. All of these studies have shown that highly precise mass measurements combined with soft ionization are capable of assigning unambiguous and exact molecular formulas. In combination with traditional gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry methods to support quantification of a subset of compounds, the team characterizes DBPs at different steps of the desalination process and evaluates the fate of produced DBPs released into the environment. The students and faculty combine desalination plant measurements with controlled laboratory studies to better understand the mechanisms and factors contributing to the production, fate and the toxicity of known and newly discovered DBPs formed in seawater during pre-chlorination and accumulated in waste waters discharged into coastal ecosystems."

This proposal hopes to develop a comprehensive understanding of the environmental behavior of a key nanomaterial: colloidal aggregates of C60, termed nC60. The nanomaterial nC60 is a poorly-understood system with subtle contributions of synthetic method and surface chemistry to its stability and reactivity. Recently published work from the PI's laboratory reports, (a) a new synthetic methods for nC60 and (b) that C60O, formed by reaction of the fullerenes with trace levels of atmospheric ozone, is the key component of many nC60 samples that renders the particles water-stable. This work will develop a deeper understanding of the hydrophilic surface chemistry of this critical nanoscale model system, with particular emphasis on a low-level fullerene derivative that has been discovered to play a vital, previously-unrecognized role in colloid formation, stability, and reactivity. In addition, methods for particle size control to allow size-dependent property studies will be developed, and the proper laboratory storage and handling conditions for these systems will be evaluated. This work leverages the PI's core expertise in nanomaterial detection and characterization, and his ability to enter into productive collaborations with health and environmental scientists who will develop and commercialize nanomaterials in biologically relevant contexts.<br/><br/>The proposed research will be coupled with an educational collaboration designed to develop hands-on exploration of nanoscale chemistry and spectroscopy for the ""Museum Without Walls"" outreach program for the Oklahoma WONDERtorium, Stillwater's children's museum. Recent fullerene studies have generated substantively conflicting predictions of this material's health and environmental hazards. Regardless of the eventual commercial significance of pristine, underivatized fullerenes, the high-profile nature of this controversy has elevated C60 to a touchstone nanoparticle, in many ways serving as a proxy for the scientific community's responsible development of nanomaterial-based applications. The success of the scientific community in proactively and convincingly elucidating the extent and mechanisms of fullerene/biological interactions will significantly impact the success of future commercialization efforts that span all of nanotechnology."

As the United States seeks to enhance its energy security through identification and development of clean energy sources a range of technologies need to be leveraged in order to secure a sustainable energy supply.  Electrochemical devices are an important part of this mix of technologies, and among these, fuel cells constitute some of the cleanest and most sustainable technologies. Several key hurdles to harnessing the potential of fuel cells (as well as various other electrochemical technologies) remain to be surmounted.  The team of investigators are focusing on anion exchange membrane fuel cells that have advantages over other types of fuel cells in not requiring precious metals and being operable with a variety of fuels at low temperature. The project is employing a cohesive strategy involving mathematical and computer modeling of specific materials components that may, in turn, guide the synthesis of new materials, the characterization and testing of these materials in actual fuel cells, and the determination of optimal design principles to govern future materials engineering in this area. The project is also providing education and training for graduate and post-graduate researchers in both theoretical and experimental aspects of materials science and engineering, thus ensuring the competence and creativity of the next generation of STEM researchers. <br/><br/><br/>The understanding and design of cost-effective and reliable polymer architectures for use as ion-conducting membranes is an important challenge facing emerging electrochemical device technologies. Currently available proton exchange membranes are problematic due to high cost, environmental concerns of fluoroplymers, and often poor performance under nonideal conditions. Additional challenges in proton exchange membranes fuel cell applications include difficult water management due to electro-osmosis, high fuel crossover, and the requirement of expensive platinum catalysts. Fuel cells based on anion exchange membranes have the potential to alleviate most of these problems. However, little systematic knowledge of how best to design these materials exists at present despite the fact that liquid-electrolyte alkaline fuel cells were among the first fuel cells to be developed. The team of researchers is applying an integrated, iterative theoretical-experimental approach towards the targeted syntheses of polymers, the first-principles computer simulations of specific polymer chemistries, the mathematical and experimental characterization of structures/morphologies, and the measurement and computational modeling of long-range hydroxide ion transport.  Through this cohesive effort, the team of investigators is aiming to advance fundamental science and engineering knowledge in the area of fuel cells membranes and to deduce a set of fundamental design principles for anion exchange membranes that accelerate the time between concept and production of practically useful materials."

Blood is red and grass is green because of a particular class of compounds - so called porphyrins, that fulfill diverse roles throughout the living world. In addition to these natural roles, these highly colored compounds can potentially be used for a variety of ""non-natural"" applications that range from their use as contrast agents to improve the imaging of biological tissue for better disease detection to their use for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide and in chemosensing efforts. With this in mind, Professor Brueckner is developing strategies to convert naturally occurring porphyrins to derivatives that possess properties the original compounds do not have. This allows them to be optimized for new applications. In addition, the derivatives being synthesized are well-suited for answering fundamental questions about the properties of the porphyrins and how those properties can be systematically altered by changes in structure. The project teaches graduate and undergraduate students in the techniques and methodologies that are used in the pharmaceutical and other industries. In this way, students are prepared to enter the workplace. Professor Brueckner's has traditionally been active in chemical education and in attracting students underrepresented in science to this most colorful research work. The multidisciplinary and very visual nature of the research make it ideal for outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is the development of strategies to convert porphyrins into pyrrole-modified porphyrins (PMPs). PMPs are macrocycles derived from porphyrins by formally replacing at least one pyrrolic building block with a different heterocycle. Starting from synthetic porphyrins, a relatively little explored strategy will be pursued: activation of the beta-position of porphyrins, followed by ring cleavage and subsequent ring-fusion. Focus in this study is the generation of PMPs containing multiple modified pyrroles, medium-size rings, or multiple annulated ring systems. The guiding hypothesis is that these modifications result in altered electronic properties when compared to their parent compounds. The suitability of the PMPs in several biological (i.e., contrast agents in photoacoustic tissue imaging) and technical (i.e. electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, chemosensing) applications will be evaluated. The proposed work relies on collaborations with intramural and extramural (international) specialty groups in a number of biological, physical sciences and engineering disciplines. The program offers a multidisciplinary and collaborative training ground for graduate students in diverse areas ranging from organic and inorganic synthesis, physical organic chemistry, photophysics, to a number of biomedical and engineering applications. This prepares them for future careers in industry or academia. The proposal also includes year-round undergraduate research projects, and it will be part of the departmental REU program. The multidisciplinary porphyrin-related research activities are ideal for dissemination in non-technical journals and make colorful subjects of outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Merner at Auburn University. The main objective of Professor Merner's research is to develop new strategies for the controlled synthesis of carbon nanotubes. At the present, one of the chief problems interfering with the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is our inability to make them in a uniform manner. Modern carbon nanotube syntheses lead to mixtures that complicate correlations between nanotube structure and physical properties. To address this gap, the Merner group is developing the synthetic tools needed to build smaller sections of a carbon nanotube that can then be assembled into larger nanotubes in a systematic way. By controlling the size of the smaller pieces, the size of the larger nanotube can be intentionally controlled. Since carbon nanotubes are made of a series of benzene rings that are stitched together, the synthesis initially targets larger cyclic systems that contain both multiple benzene rings and the functionality needed to bind the them together and build the targeted nanotubes. The lynchpin of this approach is the use of an unstrained benzene surrogate during the construction of the larger rings. Once those rings are assembled, then strained, bent benzene rings are released so they are trapped with in the larger ring structure. The route offers many opportunities to access carbon nanotube building blocks that were previously unavailable. The educational component of the program involves the development of chemical synthesis-teaching modules that are offered to rising junior and senior-level high school students in the Southeast region as part of the Auburn University Summer Science Institute. Underrepresented undergraduate students wishing to pursue graduate-level training in STEM-related fields participate in a chemical synthesis summer research program. Furthermore, in order to expose more undergraduate students to graduate-level research experiences, students enrolled in honors organic chemistry at Auburn University synthesize important starting materials that are used in future synthetic method development by graduate students in Professor Merner's laboratory. <br/><br/>Carbon nanotubes are of great interest in the fields of materials science, engineering and biological sensing. However their use in these areas is hampered by the inability to access carbon nanotubes that are of a defined, homogenous structure. In this research project, Professor Merner and his group are tackling this challenge with new synthetic strategies that imbed the nonplanar benzene rings that comprise carbon nanotubes within functionalized polycyclic building blocks. This is an important step in the construction of uniform carbon nanotubes because if the size and shape of the building blocks can be controlled, then the size and shape of the nanotube assembled from the building blocks can be controlled. In this project, the molecular complexity of the building blocks are increased systematically so that they can better understand the reactivity of strained molecules, possible releases of this strain energy to afford undesired by-products, and the reaction mechanisms by which these processes occur. This information guides the synthesis of the more complex systems eventually culminating in the construction of the carbon nanotubes themselves. The initial strategy being pursued uses a non-cross-coupling-based approach to prepare macrocyclic, functionalized carbon nanotube substructures. These functionalized systems are employed in programmed, late-stage carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to build larger structures. Several annulation strategies to join adjacent arenes are investigated and the reactions afford pi-extended macrocyclic segments that are representative of carbon nanotube sidewall structures. The target structures not only lead to development of new chemical tools for accessing these complex organic molecules, but also provide first-rate training in chemical synthesis to undergraduate and graduate students, and deepen the understanding of chemical reactivity in strained, complex hydrocarbons."

This project is cofunded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research. Proteins are molecular workhorses that perform the essential functions of life.  Proteins have evolved to adopt shapes that enable them to do these tasks. Determining the shape and motions of a protein can help reveal how it works and inform how to design new proteins to help treat disease, produce biofuels, or make new materials. Computer simulations of proteins are very useful in that they can identify the precise locations and motions of all the constituent atoms. For all but the smallest proteins, however, it is too computationally intensive to accurately predict their structure and motions even with powerful supercomputers. Ways to accelerate these simulations have been developed, but to work well they need good estimates of the structural rearrangements that the protein will make. This is a problem, since this is usually the question the simulations are trying to answer. In this work, Professor Ferguson is developing a new approach to accelerate protein folding simulations using a type of machine learning known as artificial neural networks so-called because they are based on the structure of neurons in the brain.  Neural networks allow computers to both determine these important structural pathways and use them to make simulations run faster. This new approach is being used to help understand large proteins involved in cancer and HIV infection.  It is also being incorporated into popular simulation software available for free public download. Professor Ferguson is providing research opportunities for undergraduates to work with him on this project and he is developing hands-on workshops in computational materials science as part of the Girls Learning About Materials (GLAM) summer camp at the University of Illinois. <br/><br/>The aim of this work is to establish a nonlinear machine learning approach to discover collective variables for protein folding and to use these variables to perform enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations. The success of enhanced sampling techniques in accelerating conformational sampling is predicated on the availability of good collective variables (CVs) correlated with important molecular motions. Existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., diffusion maps, Isomap, land ocally linear embedding) can ably discover good CVs, but do not furnish the explicit coordinate mapping so that biased sampling must be conducted inefficiently and indirectly in proxy variables. This work establishes a new enhanced sampling approach based on auto-associative artificial neural networks (""autoencoders"") to discover CVs that are explicit differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates and to permit calculation of analytical biasing forces. This approach is termed MESA (Molecular Enhanced Sampling with Autoencoders). MESA is validated on the short peptides alanine dipeptide and tryptophan-cage, and deployed to discover metastable states and structural transitions in a kinase overexpressed in many cancers and an envelope protein presented on the surface of HIV. MESA is made broadly available to the molecular simulation community by collaborating with the developers of OpenMM and PLUMED to contribute the approach to future releases of these software packages. Positive research experiences have great benefits for undergraduate success and retention and this work supports 10-week summer research opportunities during each year of the award.

This research program of Prof. Bruce Gibb at Tulane University utilizes bowl-shaped molecules in assembly processes that form novel chemical reactors.  Although akin to the familiar test-tube, these chemical reactors are exceedingly small.  Much like Nature's catalysts - enzymes - these reactors are capable of trapping one molecule at a time to bring about novel and selective chemical transformations.  Additionally, the program of research is designed to improve our understanding of chemical transformations using exceedingly mild conditions (e.g., room temperature water).  This research is important to society because it addresses national needs in sustainability.  The use of room temperature water helps to reduce energy cost for production of chemicals and avoid environmental issues associated with the use of organic solvents.  Broader impacts of the research include education and training of graduate and undergraduate students as the next generation of productive members and leaders in the chemical sciences, as well as outreach activities designed to promote chemistry within the local community and to broaden participation in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art of supramolecular chemistry has now reached a point that the construction of (supra)molecular containers is relatively facile.  Building on this, a significant aim of this program of research is to consider how electrostatic potential fields within nano-spaces can be engineered, and in doing so, how it is possible to control guest reactivity and catalysis within the nano-space.  This program of research focuses on three classes of chemical conversions (cyclization reactions, stereoselective halogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds, and halogenation of aromatic compounds) using cavitands and deep-cavity cavitands as scaffolds and hosts.  All of the chemical conversions being studied utilize water as the solvent and take advantage of the hydrophobic effect to drive guest complexation and/or promote turnover.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, EDTA is the most abundant organic pollutant in surface waters around the world, including the US. EDTA forms strong complexes with toxic heavy metals and mobilizes them, which increases exposure of humans. Several EDTA-degrading bacteria exist in nature. However, applying those bacteria in remediation is not practical because they are not efficient enough.

In such cycloadditions, two molecular fragments, a four-carbon piece (the diene) and a three-carbon piece (the allylic cation)are joined in a single reaction.  The key feature is the generation of the allylic cation, which possesses a positive charge, and is paired with a partner (negatively-charged) anion that is also chiral.  Chirality is the condition of any object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.  For example, left and right hands are mirror images, but cannot be superimposed.  The idea is that this chirality can be used to induce chirality in the formation of the products of the (4+3)-cycloaddition reaction.  This is significant because the molecules of life, as well as many drugs are chiral and occur not as mixtures of right and left handed molecules, but as either right or left.  This is generally known as asymmetry.  The development of reactions that are asymmetric, producing only right or left handed products, is of great current interest across science and the chemical industry.  Professor Harmata will integrate the research and educational components of this project within a new outreach program for middle school students. Through a series of workshops aimed at highlighting the connections between everyday experience and chemistry advances, this program provides middle school students with a discovery-based experience that captures the creativity of the STEM fields through experiments. Professor Harmata has established partnerships with local school districts and charter schools to reach an underprivileged community, which is underrepresented in the sciences. The program promotes the pursuit of higher education in the STEM fields by providing an opportunity for middle-school students to discuss scientific observations while interacting with college students. This concept will be demonstrated through the process of dyeing, in which charged dyes will selectively dye oppositely charge fabrics.  Procedures will be developed by middle school teachers who will test and refine the ideas on 4H members during the summers and then transfer the teaching technology back to their classrooms during academic years.  Targets classrooms are particularly those that are rural or otherwise underserved in the context of exposure to STEM programs.<br/><br/>The scientific program will consist of the generation of allylic cations from allylic alcohols using chiral phosphoric acids that have been designed to ion pair with allylic cations.  These species are anticipated to react with dienes in a diastereoselective fashion, resulting in a net enantioselectivity in the cycloadducts. This will provide new methodology for the enantioselective synthesis of seven-membered carbocyclic rings.   Some screening will also be conducted as part of the reaction development process.  Both inter- and intramolecular reactions will be examined.  Optimization protocols will be pursued in an effort to maximize enantioselectivity."

In contrast, thermosets are typically harder materials that are solvent and heat resistant and but cannot generally be reprocessed or recycled after their initial formation.  Prof. Christopher Bowman at the University of Colorado is exploring the use of dynamic covalent chemistry approaches to transition between these two states of matter.  In dynamic covalent chemistry as implemented here, upon application of a desired stimulus such as exposure to light or heat, chemical bond structures become activated - repeatedly breaking and reforming the bonds within the polymer structure in a manner that converts one type of polymer to the other. This project investigates the fundamental relationships between the polymer structure and the inherent aspects of the dynamic covalent chemistry including the reactive chemical functional group, the catalysts used to facilitate the reaction, the kinetics of the reaction, and the concentration of the dynamic covalent bond. This project investigates fundamental phenomena of synthetic and polymer chemistry as well as demonstrable advancement of applied science all while providing profound educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students alike.  Further, the project trains diverse personnel, comprising a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, in a unique combination of chemical synthesis, materials science, and polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>Supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, the Bowman research team aims to implement the thiol-thioester exchange reaction as a photoactivatable and photodeactivatable dynamic covalent chemistry in crosslinked polymer networks.

Fundamental understanding of the thiol-thioester exchange reaction and the kinetics of its catalysis in a non-polar, relatively immobile environment allows researchers to fine-tune the desired bond exchange process and the corresponding dynamic polymer properties. Combinations of various exogenously delivered stimuli (i.e., different wavelengths of light, addition or removal of heat) are used to control the activation of compounds within the network that catalyze the dynamic covalent chemistry between pendant thiol groups and thioester crosslinks and to arrest the exchange reaction with orthogonal stimuli. Specifically, dual handles of light and heat-based stimuli for starting and stopping the dynamic covalent chemistry are developed. Taking advantage of the thiol/thioester exchange reaction the Bowman research team aims to create covalently crosslinked polymers that are capable of user-directed, reversible transitions from rigid thermoset to malleable thermoplastic that has applications in optical materials, additive manufacturing, and adhesives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radioisotopes have been a cornerstone of biological research for nearly a century because of the ubiquitous nature of the most common radioisotopes of C, H, S, and P in chemical and biological systems, and because their incorporation is less invasive compared to fluorophores.  Common methods of detection for radioisotopes are typically incompatible with living/functional biological systems/components and as such provide little information about system dynamics.  The novel nanomaterial sensor (termed ""nanoSPA"") being developed by Dr. Aspinwall provides a water-soluble, biocompatible platform to enable real-time analysis of radioisotope-labeled compounds with high selectivity and sensitivity.  The project focuses on development and characterization of nanoSPA sensors with emphasis on key variables that affect sensor function and performance.  The work targets optimization of light output and multiplexing capabilities via integration of new scintillant materials; identification of novel biofunctionalization approaches; and performance evaluation in model biochemical systems.

Lewis of California Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to study the changes in the reactivity of technologically important semiconductor surfaces that accompany the transition from small molecules to nanocrystals and two-dimensional materials, as well as from nanocrystals and two-dimensional materials to bulk crystalline solids.  The aim is to gain fundamental insight into the transition in behavior from materials comprised of individual bonds to materials formed by extended one-, two-, and ultimately three-dimensional bonding.  The project promotes the progress of science by developing novel reaction pathways that exploit the size-dependent changes in surface reactivity.  Si surfaces, small-molecule models of Si surfaces, and Si nanocrystals are selected as a critical example to provide insight into the chemical continuum from the nanoscale to the macroscale.  The novel reaction pathways being developed may enable a new generation of solar cells, new interfaces for sensors and electronic devices and new approaches to other related Si device constructs.  Graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds are involved in the project.  In addition, the research results are incorporated into Freshmen chemistry course material, integrated in outreach program towards high schools, such as Juice from Juice and Project SEAL hands-on science modules, and communicated to non-professional audiences at all levels and through multiple media outlets.       <br/><br/>In this project, new classes of reactions that are enabled by changes in the electronic structure of semiconductors that result from changes in the size and dimensionality of the material are explored.    The project is focused on determining: 1) which classes of reactions are influenced by the underlying electronic structure of the solid, 2) whether such reactions can be used to systematically achieve beneficial electronic coupling between nanoparticles, and, 3) whether such reactions can be used to covalently link three-dimensional materials, such as bulk crystals, to two-dimensional materials while also providing control over the electronic coupling of the structurally dissimilar materials.  The scope of the project includes reactions on Si surfaces, small-molecule models of Si surfaces, and Si nanocrystals.  The project also includes reactions on two-dimensional materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition-metal chalcogenides anchored to Si surfaces.  This project is also developing methods to covalently functionalize two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, to allow robust electronic connections and strong interactions between layers and in heterojunction stacks.  Functionalized two-dimensional materials are being attached to linkers covalently bonded to the Si surface, and more layers are being added to the stack using sequential addition of layers and linkers until the behavior approximates that of the bulk material on Si, as determined by XPS and optical characterization methods.

Professor Tianning Diao from New York University and colleague Nathaniel Traaseth have acquired a continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This instrument allows research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid-state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of possible pathological growth. These studies impact many areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid-state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at New York University. In addition to gaining competency in a methodology that is central to organic, inorganic, biophysical, and materials research, the EPR spectrometer is used in coursework and is also used by students participating in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program and by visiting summer research undergraduate and high-school students. Workshops in EPR techniques are organized in the context of the REU programs. Most of the high school and undergraduate student participants are from minority-serving institutions and four-year colleges. The EPR spectrometer is open to the broader user community, including students, faculty, and industrial scientists in the tri-state area, the nation's largest school district and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse. This expands the user base to students from four-year colleges that are often unfamiliar with advanced instrumentation and graduate school opportunities in science and engineering. These activities will contribute to the improvement of science education in New York City and surrounding areas.<br/><br/>The award of this spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids studies of mechanisms of nickel-catalyzed reactions, the determination of the molecular mechanism of membrane transport proteins, (as well as studies of electron transfer to design molecular probes. The instrumentation is also used for developing copper-based reconfigurable catalysts and for exploring growth induced crystal curvature. The instrument also serves researchers preparing polynuclear hydride-radical cations, doping impurities in semiconductor nanocrystals, and those studying the mechanism of cobalt and manganese-catalyzed reductive reactions at CUNY John-Jay. The spectrometer benefits the determination of conformational changes in disordered proteins and the determination of the effect of lactose monohydrate crystallization on the active site of phosphotriesterase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While significant advances in small molecule detection have been made, challenges still exist in providing flexible detection methodologies for accurate chemical identification and sensitive and selective detection of some molecules. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Haes at the University of Iowa focuses on developing surface sensitive techniques such as surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a tool molecular detection. SERS is a light-based technique that is used to identify and quantify molecules that adsorb onto metal surfaces. Most molecules do not stick to metal surfaces, limiting the utility of SERS and similar methods. Professor Haes and her group use both experimental and modeling methods to develop the SERS technique so that it can be used to provide accurate chemical identification with high selectivity and sensitivity.  Through this research, Professor Haes provides opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students to work on practical problems.  The Haes research group performs outreach activities with K-12 students that are focused on the ""Size of Things"".  This project helps students learn about the implications of size on the properties of nanoscale and macroscale objects through hands-on activities.  Underrepresented minority students are recruited through the University of Iowa's Center of Exemplary Mentoring.  In addition, all personnel participate in educational development and outreach activities geared towards introducing science to Iowa's students in grades K-12. Specifically, Dr. Haes develops a ""Size of Things"" exhibit for display with a learning game for the size of nanoscale and macroscale objects. They build off of educational activities developed by Public Television (DragonTV on Nano)and provide interactive activities related to (1) What is a nanometer? How big is one billion meters? How small is one-billionth of a meter?; (2) Why is ""nanogold"" red and ""nanosilver"" yellow?; and (3) My nanosilver socks do not smell but should I be worried that the nanosilver will get into my body? <br/><br/>This project seeks answers regarding how and why some molecules are difficult to detect using SERS. Despite many successful examples of direct small molecule detection using SERS, at least three issues remain including: (1) unpredictable properties of nanomaterials that arise from aggregation, (2) inefficient binding of some classes of molecules to surfaces, and (3) low signals associated with targeted molecules. The two research questions are answered by varying nanoparticle morphology and solution conditions. Research tasks focus on quantifying molecular binding metrics and SERS enhancements and evaluating how solution conditions impact binding metrics, nanoparticle stability, and SERS activity. Key experimental design features are identified so adsorbate-surface interactions are rationally and reproducibly promoted thus facilitating direct detection of molecules using surface-enhanced spectroscopies. Students are trained in the areas of nanoscience, spectroscopy, and measurement science. Through the supported research, the Haes research group is developing design rules that overcome current measurement challenges thus expanding the utility of SERS in a variety of applications."

A ""superfluid"" is a fluid that can flow without the internal friction or viscosity of liquids. The cold temperature (a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, which is -273.15 degrees Celsius) and viscosity free condition of superfluid helium makes it possible to use electric or magnetic fields outside the droplet to control the orientation of molecules inside the helium droplet.  This in turn makes it possible to measure fundamental properties of these molecules (for example the electric and magnetic ""poles"" of the molecules).  It also makes it possible to understand how molecules aggregate into clusters. The research group is considering the study of a variety of important molecules and their agglomerates, including biological species and ""molecular magnets."" The broader scientific impacts of the project stem from the fact that electric and magnetic characteristics of biological, molecular-magnet systems are relevant to fields ranging from protein synthesis to quantum computing.  Graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers are mentored in a highly interdisciplinary area of research and are involved in outreach programs and in science fairs.  Undergraduate students gain experience in giving scientific presentations, as they present their work at USC's annual Undergraduate Symposium for Scholarly and Creative Work.  Professor Kresin is also involved in the national Society of Physics Students' ""Adopt-a-Physicist"" program which connects high school classes with professional scientists for conversations and questions about careers, science, school, work, and life balance.<br/><br/>Helium nanodroplets are produced by the supersonic expansion of cold helium gas. These droplets pick up guest molecules by passing through pick-up cells and then traverse a strong inhomogeneous electric or magnetic field which both orients the polar impurity and exerts an intense deflecting force. This force is measured by mapping out the beam profile - in this way yielding an experimental readout of the magnitude of the dipole moment of a single ultracold molecule or molecular complex. This technique is applied to amino acids and small peptides, to hydrated acid complexes, to molecular magnets, and to molecular assemblies whose reaction pathways can be custom pre-aligned by the external field. The study and control of cold polar molecule interactions, assemblies, and reactions is attracting considerable interdisciplinary interest in view of their relevance to quantum computing, novel condensate phases, molecular interferometry, and investigations of fundamental symmetries."

Single molecule measurements provide information about each molecules that move at a fast rate or rare events that would otherwise be buried by bulk measurements.  To monitor the movement and structural changes of biomolecules at such a small scale, Professor Reinhard makes a molecular ruler based on optical interaction of gold nanoparticles (NPs). Fast and subtle changes in biomolecular structure and movements lead to changes in the spectral signature of these gold NPs, which can be captured at fast speed and be used to understand the behavior of biomolecules. The developed technique could elucidate the role of structural fluctuations of proteins and other biomolecules in complex biological systems, which could lead to new advances in biological, biomedical, and environmental research.  Professor Reinhard works with his graduate and undergraduate students on the project, providing them an opportunity to work at the interface between biophysical chemistry, bioplasmonics, and biomaterials. Professor Reinhard also organizes workshops, offers research internships, and develops web-modules to share with the general public of his research outcomes. A particular emphasis of his outreach activities is to attract members of groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering to the research of this project.<br/><br/>Professor Reinhard is developing a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based correlation spectroscopy. He utilizes distance-dependent near-field coupling between plasmonic NPs that cause spectral fluctuations in the far-field to monitor interparticle separations which would allow him to obtain long-time signal correlation studies of individual biopolymer molecules entirely without blinking artefacts. In this project, Professor Reinhard uses plasmon coupling correlation spectroscopy (PCCS) to measure the effect of nanoconfinement on the mechanical properties of DNA and experimentally test the validity of conventional polymer models under nano-confinement.

Professor Khalid Salaita of Emory University is developing a new approach for chemical sensing that is based on detecting the motion of DNA-based motors. Chemical sensing is broadly important for fields ranging from point of care diagnostics to agriculture and environmental sustainability. Sensing in biological systems typically occurs in conditions that are far-from-equilibrium, yet most chemical assays are performed at or near equilibrium conditions. Given the extraordinary sensitivity of biological sensing, it is desirable to consider approaches to sensing under conditions that are far-from-equilibrium. There are inherent challenges in pursuing  well-controlled reactions that operate out of equilibrium and that can be harnessed for sophisticated chemical measurements. The funded project addresses these challenges and potentially improves current approaches in analytical chemistry. The broader impacts include educational and outreach goals focused on developing new undergraduate and graduate courses that use 3D printing as a tool for the chemical sciences. The course is tailored toward first-year graduate students and undergraduates and enhances their ability to leverage 3D printing in their own research efforts.<br/><br/>Professor Salaita's laboratory has examined a new class of synthetic DNA-based motors that move at a speed that is 1000 times faster than current DNA based machines. These motors transport 5-micron particles distances of up to one millimeter.

This assay is optimized for DNA sensing using automated image analysis. The focus is on testing the specificity of the assay by measuring particle speed in response to single nucleotide polymorphism of the target oligonucleotide.

The goal of the project is to exploit the special capabilities afforded by the combination of these two disciplines to advance a technical solution to some important societal needs.  More specifically, these researchers explore how ultrafast pulsed laser light interacting with metal nano-materials can be used to enhance and control chemistry on metal surfaces for applications such as chemical catalysis, pollution mitigation, energy conversion, chemical imaging and sensing applications. The on-going experiments develop a detailed description of how molecules interact with nanostructured metal surfaces. Well-established methodologies are already in place that allow the design of nanoscale surfaces with exquisite control.  The results of these experiments reveal molecular level details of how these materials interact with molecules and thus provide information on optimizing nanostructures design strategies for the applications cited above. The collaborative nature of this research effort provides participating students with unique experience at the interface of materials and ultrafast science, and thus promote cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at Boston University.  In synergy with the research, this grant supports a substantial education and outreach program to include participation of local Community College students and faculty, inner city and greater Boston area High School students, and High School teachers in conjunction with a newly awarded NSF research experience for undergraduates (REU) site program, as well as other BU based outreach programs.<br/><br/>The merger of ultrafast spectroscopy and nanotechnology is being used to study the dynamics and interactions of molecules on plasmonically active surfaces via three ultrafast laser techniques.  Plasmonically enhanced (PE) optical heterodyne detected Raman spectroscopy (PE-OHD-RIKES) offers sensitivity advantages for viewing Raman responses on plasmonic surfaces, especially for low frequency modes resulting from molecular-surface physi-adsorption, and a phase sensitive methodology for understanding vibrational and plasmon contributions to nonlinear responses.  Analysis of PE three-pulse photon echo peak shift measurements (PE 3PEPS) yields a dynamical description of optical dephasing, or equivalently solvation, of molecules on plasmonic surfaces (inhomogeneous energy distributions, spectral diffusion and fluctuation timescales). Finally, the successful implementation of PE femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (PE-FSRS), could have enormous impact as a new probe of surface chemistry allowing vibrationally-specific labels to follow the evolution of short-lived intermediates and rapid conformation changes of excited molecules on plasmonic surfaces. Determined dynamical and structural properties of analytes on plasmonic substrates is being contrasted with those of liquid solutions and correlated with observed plasmonic based phenomenon such as SERS enhancement factors. Substrates are being fabricated by a template-guided self-assembly procedure which results in electromagnetically strongly coupled nanoparticle cluster arrays where optical fields are enhanced by both near field coupling between nanoparticles, and diffractive coupling between clusters.  Detailed molecular level information about how molecules interact with engineered plasmonic surfaces is providing rational design strategies for maximizing plasmon enhancement of optical responses and chemical outcomes. The implementation of this methodology is impactful upon optical imaging capabilities in terms of improved sensitivity and faster acquisition times, real time monitoring of photoinduced surface chemical reactivity, enhanced chemical and biological sensing capabilities, and improved strategies for subsequent spontaneous SERS and other plasmonic based techniques."

Gates from the University of Missouri to investigate the chemistry of unavoidable DNA damage that takes place within living systems. Damage to DNA in cells is important because it can influence aging or it may cause cancer, for example. Cross-links that permanently join the two single strands of the DNA double helix may prevent the strand separation required for the read-out of the genetic information stored in the sequence of bases in the double helix. The molecular nature of the cross-links formed in cellular DNA is unknown. The Gates group is investigating errors in crosslinking DNA strands that may represent biologically-important DNA damage. Professor Gates studies the chemical details of the formation of these crosslinks and the impact they have on the DNA structure. The project provides excellent training in the use of chemical and biochemical techniques for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Missouri. The work develops methods and materials that can be used by other researchers who study DNA damage in living systems. Additionally, Professor Gates develops a new Chemistry Engagement Program to foster interest in the chemical sciences of 8th and 9th grade students.  This program helps students prepare for chemistry and other science majors in college and makes them aware of diverse STEM career options. <br/><br/>The observation that elaborate interstrand cross-link repair pathways are retained across all walks of life suggests that the formation of endogenous cross-links in cellular DNA is unavoidable. The molecular nature of endogenous cross-links generated in cellular DNA remains unknown. Professor Gates' research builds on the recent finding that the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde sugar remnant (3'-dRP) arising from cleavage of true abasic sites in duplex DNA can react with an adenine residue on the opposing strand to forge an interstrand cross-link adjacent to a strand break. It is striking that this common type of DNA damage in the genome has the potential to generate interstrand cross-links, which are among the most deleterious of all lesions. Therefore, 3'-dRP-derived cross-links are potential candidates for unavoidable endogenous cross-links in cellular DNA. These cross-links could be relevant to mutagenesis, evolution, aging, neurodegeneration, and cancer. The importance of the proposed work on 3'-dRP-derived cross-links is anchored in the unprecedented structure and mechanistic origin of the lesions along with their potential biological significance as unavoidable endogenous DNA damage. The research is focused on the characterization of the formation and properties of 3'-dRP-derived cross-links with canonical nucleobases in various sequences of duplex DNA, the study of how glutathione modulates the cross-linking, and the elucidation of the chemical structure and cellular occurrence 3'-dRP-derived cross-links using rigorously-characterized synthetic standards combined with LC-MS/MS analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prof. Srivastava's group is developing novel catalytic systems to convert simple hydrocarbons to value-added products. The main goal of the proposed research is to design and develop novel catalytic systems for the production of valuable molecules that are of industrial significance. The method uses copper catalysts with chiral ligands. The demand for chiral allyl amines has escalated sharply in recent years, driven by the demands in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavors, fragrances, and materials. In addition, these catalytic methods are potential useful for the total synthesis of bioactive molecules and chiral drugs.  The researchers have introduced comprehensive educational and outreach programs associated with intellectual and economic development. Professor Srivastava's group has been working at the interface of organic, organometallics, and catalysis chemistry.  <br/><br/>This research addresses the development of a direct catalytic asymmetric amination of simple (non-functionalized) allylic carbon-hydrogen (C-H) substrates using hydroxylamines as aminating agents. The prior art on this field used oxidative amination to make chiral N-hydroxy allyl amines that require additional methods to make chiral allyl amines. The main aim is to find suitable catalytic systems that would deliver the chiral allyl amines with high yields and enantioselectivities. This approach includes rational design and synthesis of new chiral ligands and complexes.  The research project screens the catalysts under various reaction conditions while varying solvents, temperature, and additives. The next objective is to explore the synthetic applications to access valuable chemicals such as chiral beta-alkyl N-aryl Aza Baylis-Hillman (ABH) adducts, beta-amino esters and beta-lactams, as well as bioactive molecules such as hydroxymethyl docetaxel fragment, Ezetimibe, and Vigabatrin. Another objective is to address mechanistic aspects of the reaction and provide a better understanding of the reaction pathway and the catalytic activity.  This objective helps to develop new catalysts and novel synthetic methods. Professor Srivastava's program enhances public awareness of the importance of chemical sciences. Undergraduates, K-12 students, and high school teachers are exposed to cutting-edge science related to chemical catalysis through summer research and teacher training workshops. The education outreach initiatives involve the inclusion of women and underrepresented groups and strengthen competitiveness by promoting enhancement programs such as LSAMP and McNair program to retain students."

Pesticides and herbicides are used to kill weeds and insects, but these chemicals last a long time and can be found throughout the environment. These chemicals can be damaging to animals and humans, and have even been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Using basic chemistry techniques, this project from Professor Louis Kuo at Lewis and Clark College looks for ways to make these pesticides and herbicides safer.  A main ingredient in these chemicals is the element phosphorus. This project also investigates the use of non-toxic metals to collect, break down, safely recover, and transform the phosphate-based toxins for a new use.  Phosphorus is non-renewable and essential for life on earth, so recycling it is important for sustainability. This research lies at the interface of inorganic and organic chemistry, and uses a combination of experimental and computational techniques. Undergraduate researchers, high school students, and high school teachers participate in this project, while engaging in meaningful science within the context of safe environmental stewardship.<br/><br/>This research project addresses environmental toxin remediation and phosphorus recovery. Organophosphates (OP) are agricultural pesticides that are now ubiquitous in the environment. As such, there is a need for materials that degrade these OP pesticides in a practical fashion. This goal is more meaningful when the degraded OP pesticides are recovered as usable organophosphates since phosphorus is an essential but non-renewable resource.  This study focuses on using supported and solution=-phase molybdenum complexes that convert organophosphate toxins into commodity chemicals.  Specifically, the project examines how polystyrene-supported and picolinato (solution) complexes of molybdenum-peroxo compounds convert sulfur-containing organophosphate pesticides and the widely-used glyphosate herbicide (Roundup) into phosphate commodity chemicals. Several hypothetical routes involving reactive oxygen species are tested with spectroscopic studies on solution models and supported molybdenum-peroxo complexes.  In parallel with the experimental work there is a computational component using density functional theory that simulates the organophosphate reactions.  The goal is to predict and design better molybdenum complexes that accomplish the organophosphate degradation.  In this connection, the long term goal is to develop new supported and practical molybdenum-peroxo materials that degrade the organophosphate toxins into value-added materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus is on lasers rather than more conventional means (e.g., an applied voltage, or changes in thermodynamic control variables) because lasers offer the possibility of change on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second). The Franco group investigates, for instance, the microscopic origin of the fastest existing method for the generation of currents, and the ability of lasers to turn insulating materials into transient metals. In addition to interest at a fundamental level, pushing the time limit in which electronic properties can be controlled has the potential to catalyze transformative progress in chemistry, spectroscopy, optoelectronic device design, communication through electrical signals, and any other science or technology based on electronic properties and their control. Professor Franco is impacting graduate education by redesigning the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry through active learning pedagogies. With this project, he contributes to the development of a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering workforce by creating summer research opportunities for top international undergraduate students in Chemistry at the University of Rochester.<br/><br/>Specifically, the Franco group advances the capabilities of using high and intermediate intensity ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in nanoscale matter. The vision of the group is to establish structure-function relations that apply to matter driven far from equilibrium by laser fields, and to push the limit in which control of electrons is exerted. A fundamental limit that has historically hindered progress in the quantum control of electrons is the deleterious effects on the control introduced by ultrafast electronic decoherence processes arising from electron-nuclear interactions. To overcome this limit, Professor Franco and his research group: (i) Identify, model, and quantify basic mechanisms for electronic coherence loss, as a necessary step in the design of laser control scenarios that either avoid or take advantage of the decoherence. (ii) Develop novel routes for laser control of electrons based on the Dynamic Stark Effect induced by non-resonant laser fields of intermediate intensity (non-perturbative but non-ionizing) that are robust to decoherence. Together, these developments catalyze the design of novel control experiments, ultrafast opto-electronic technologies, and a new class of dynamic electronic materials with effective laser-induced properties tunable on a femtosecond timescale.

Norton at Columbia University leads a team exploring fundamental issues in organotitanium chemistry.  Titanium, inexpensive and nontoxic, offers sustainable ways of carrying out a variety of chemical transformations.  This project aims to use inexpensive titanium-based reagents for the synthesis of valuable organic compounds - not only heterocycles but also the enantioenriched compounds essential to the pharmaceutical industry.  This project involves a mixture of inorganic, organometallic, and organic chemistry, and is therefore ideal for training young workers for careers in science.  Students in the research group are encouraged to interact with both academic and industrial scientists, better preparing themselves for permanent positions on either side of the academic/industrial divide. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project addresses three fundamental questions in organotitanium chemistry: (1) The insertion of isonitriles into titanium-carbon (Ti-C) bonds.  The insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into Ti-C bonds has served as a powerful synthetic tool.  In principle CO can be replaced by any of the isoelectronic isonitriles (RNC), giving transformations that could be as useful as CO insertion;  (2) Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.  Chiral titanaaziridines and titanaoxiranes undergo rapid enantiomer interconversion, a property which makes them potentially useful for dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.  In principle, this approach can generate enantioenriched chemicals from inexpensive racemic starting materials; and (3) Replacement of cyclopentadienyl ligand based Ti reagents with less expensive and more abundant alkoxy ligand based Ti reagents."

The sensors are made from biocompatible building blocks which self-assemble upon analyte detection by exploiting recognition principles encoded in natural nucleic acids. The design approach allows the construction of sensors that detect a variety of different analytes simultaneously.  A signal is generated only if a threshold concentration is reached for all analytes at the same time. The sensors constitute a novel application of biological materials in nanotechnology which is a rapidly emerging field of research for medical devices and environmental monitoring. The broader impact of the work is related to the development of novel RNA-based nanosensors whose function relies on the self-assembly from short oligonucleotides, triggered by analyte recognition. Students involved in the research gain broad and interdisciplinary training in areas of materials and device development for biological and medical applications. <br/><br/>This research develops sensors for biologically-active analytes based on modular RNA nanostructures that contain several copies of an aptamer which self-assemble to a signaling configuration in a cooperative response to ligand binding. By coupling sensor RNA assembly with multivalent cooperative ligand binding, sensing devices are created with nonlinear dose response over a wide dynamic range. The design concept for the sensors is based on previously developed self-assembling RNA nanostructures, including double-stranded RNAs in the shape of a square or triangle. The RNA nanosensors capitalize on two unique properties of RNA nanostructures: their modular design, which facilitates the rapid iterative optimization of sensor constructs for a variety of ligands, and their self-assembly from short oligonucleotides in an all-or-nothing process. The nanostructures design provides the basis for nonlinear cooperativity of ligand binding at multiple recognition sites. Modular design facilitates the design of a wide variety of RNA nanosensors with up to 4 ligand recognition sites within a single construct, allowing the design of AND-gated as well as OR-gated sensors.  The sensor signaling is dependent on either the simultaneous or exclusive presence of two different ligands. Self-assembly of the complete signaling-competent RNA nanosensor depends on ligand binding to all aptamer units and gives rise to cooperative recognition behavior of multiple binding sites. The novel RNA nanosensors are capable of nonlinear dose response over a wide dynamic range.  The research is performed by graduate and undergraduate students who are trained in a diverse array of technical skills including nucleic acid biochemistry, fluorescence assays, cloning, and biochemical in vitro assay development. The graduate students involved in the research gain a broad and interdisciplinary training, which renders the project ideally suited for the Chemical Biology graduate track at UCSD.

Since the institution at which the research is taking place serves a high proportion of individuals from groups underrepresented in the sciences and engineering, the project provides important opportunities to engage in the professional training of individuals from these communities.<br/> <br/>Ionic liquid salts are materials of considerable fundamental interest and growing practical utility. Because of their non-volatility, ionic liquids can be used in applications requiring high temperatures, such as in heat transfer, lubrication, or high-temperature materials synthesis. Although typical ionic liquid salts have relatively high degrees of thermal stability, many of them are still incapable of being used for long durations at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius.  By exploiting tetraarylphosphonium and triarylsulfonium salts, ionic liquid salts capable of remaining stable at temperatures of 300 degrees Celsius for periods over three months have been achieved by Professor Davis' group.  New strategies are being pursued to improve their thermal stability profile.  These strategies include the use of thermally stable anions, cross-linking of the molecules, the incorporation of graphene, and blending with oligophenylene ethers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many organic molecules that appear in pharmaceuticals or as components of advanced materials possess several carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. These C-H bonds are very hard to break and to convert into new and different bonds that allow access to complex chemical structures.  In this project, Dr. Timothy H. Warren of Georgetown University is developing new ways to modify organic molecules by direct modification of these challenging C-H bonds. Ongoing academic and industrial collaborations allow access to a broad range of methods to discover, optimize, and understand these new chemical transformations. Professor Warren is connecting with high-risk middle school students from low income families in under-resourced communities through the organization Higher Achievement.

Warren of Georgetown University is designing and developing new catalytic protocols to construct carbon-nitrogen (C-N), carbon-oxygen (C-O), and carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds directly from carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. These C-H functionalization methodologies enable the exploration of chemical space not easily accessible via traditional synthetic methods. In particular, innovative approaches to prepare C-C bonds are under development, guided by detailed mechanistic studies that outline the chemical reactivity of key copper-containing intermediates responsible for C-C bond formation. Catalyst design allows for the selective modification of strong C-H bonds in the presence of weaker ones, allowing control over C-H functionalization regioselectivity. Ongoing collaborations with Prof. Tom Cundari (U. North Texas) and Merck (Rahway, NJ) are enabling in depth computational assessment of reaction mechanisms as well as high throughput screening for reaction discovery and optimization. Through the organization Higher Achievement, Professor Warren is connecting with high-risk middle school students from low income families in under-resourced communities, and is hosting a fun chemistry show held at Georgetown each summer.

These fundamental studies examine factors such as ligand field strength, spin state interconversion, and coordination geometry, which may influence the rate and selectivity of these transformations.  This research will further the utilization of base-metals as surrogates for platinum group metal catalysis in reactions ranging from cross-coupling to carbocyanation.  In concert with the research endeavors, this project is enhancing the training of undergraduate students through peer mentoring and tutorials as well as through a discovery-based introduction to physical sciences for pre-college students.   <br/><br/>A variety of manufacturing industries rely on metal-based catalysis to produce chemicals and materials in an energy efficient and cost-effective manner.  The past decades have witnessed a significant growth in the number of important new catalytic reactions promoted by metal catalysts; however, the metals employed in these discoveries have largely come from a group of expensive, rare, and toxic metals.  This research project seeks to develop routes to accomplish some of the same important catalytic reactions using metals that are much more abundant, less expensive, and potentially less toxic.

Prof. Professor Shubham Vyas and his students investigate the mechanisms by which perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are transformed in the environment. PFAAs are synthetic chemicals that are used as coating for carpets, textiles and paper, and fire extinguishing foams. Because PFAAs are very unreactive chemicals, they are extremely persistent compounds in the environment. They also pose threats to human and ecological health, for instance as pollutants in drinking water. The overall goal of this project is to test various chemical conditions in which one can improve the destruction of PFAAs in aqueous environment. At the same time, the energy demand for such a process should be reduced. Several undergraduate and graduate students are getting trained during this project as they engage in multidisciplinary research in environmental chemistry. Furthermore, the investigators actively use research strategies and findings from this project to reach out to K-12 students and educators.<br/><br/>Professor Vyas and his team employ a coupled experimental and computational approach to carry out this project. They use two representative PFAAs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). Chemical computations using density functional theory and post-Hartree-Fock-based calculations provide guidance for experimental efforts. The experiments iteratively feed findings back into the chemical computations. This improves the models and explains unusual experimental findings. The Vyas lab studies the degradation of PFAAs using superoxide radical anion, hydroxyl radical, and persulfate radical anion in the presence of transition metal cations. These reactions are likely facilitated by heat or by external light. Time-resolved absorption spectroscopic measurements provide information on reactive intermediates and the efficiency of light triggered reactions. Mass spectrometric and chromatographic measurements are used to monitor reaction products. Students participating in this inherently interdisciplinary research project acquire a unique skill set that incorporates elements of computational and experimental environmental chemistry, providing them with skills for their future careers. This project is also used as a vehicle to incorporate concepts of environmental computational chemistry into undergraduate and graduate chemistry curricula."

By constructing artificial analogs of the enzymes that Nature uses to build molecules, new potential medicines may be discovered. In this project, Dr. Gorske is developing enzyme mimics to accomplish this goal. The design of these enzyme mimics is allowing undergraduates to construct them with minimal training. This is enabling students to gain experience conducting meaningful research prior to choosing a major. Such early access to these research experiences, which include both summer research internships and course-related laboratories, is stimulating interest in pursuing science as a career. Especially, underprepared and underrepresented students and groups are being exposed to STEM fields.

These studies are elucidating the structural design parameters of peptidomimetic catalysts that maintain their competency in polar solvents and facilitate nucleophilic trifluoromethylation reactions. In turn, the results of these investigations are informing iterative cycles of catalyst design and structure-activity relationship analysis that aim to produce highly enantio- and regio-selective nucleophilic trifluoromethylation catalysts with wide substrate scope. More broadly, a new class of structured catalyst scaffolds designed to be generally applicable to a wide range of reactions is being realized, while simultaneously providing early but authentic research experiences for undergraduates.

NMR is a powerful technique for determining the structure of molecules, including bond angles and distances not available through any other technique.  Dr. Casabianca's work is important for understanding how nanoparticles behave when they enter the body, which is increasingly relevant as the use of nanoparticles in medicine and consumer products increases.

The actinide elements are those with atomic numbers 89-103 (i.e., actinium through lawrencium, including uranium, thorium and plutonium). All actinides are radioactive; that is, they release energy upon radioactive decay. Several actinides (e.g. uranium) are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.  Americium is used in most modern smoke detectors. The actinides are important to society due to their use in medicine, power generation, and national security. Since the actinide elements are radioactive, they are far less studied than other elements on the periodic table. In this project, Dr. Hixon studies the environmental behavior of the actinide element plutonium using both experiments and models. The goal is to address the relationship between plutonium concentration, the particle size of the solid, and the structure of the solid. The education of a future workforce that understands the health and safety aspects of radioactive elements contributes directly to advancing national health and securing the national defense. By using the facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratory, this CAREER program gives students the opportunity to work within federal laboratory facilities leveraging and advancing new and novel techniques such as Pu-239 NMR spectroscopy. The nuclear energy lesson plan kits are a valuable resource for the South Bend Community School Corporation, which has a large minority student population.

Such reactions commonly proceed by cleaving the carbon-carbon bonds of the molecules in a process that requires dioxygen (O2) from the atmosphere.  The mechanism by which biological iron sites facilitate these O2-dependent reactions is not fully understood, which hinders the design of man-made molecules capable of using O2 as a cheap and environmentally-friendly oxidant.  In this project, Dr. Adam Fiedler is generating a series of model systems, ranging from small complexes to supramolecular assemblies, to obtain molecular-level insights into the O2 reactivity of iron in both biological and man-made contexts.  A powerful combination of spectroscopic and computational tools is utilized to characterize unstable and transient species that have been proposed (but rarely observed) in Nature.  In this way, the project provides a more complete picture of reactions that are essential for the remediation of polluted soils and groundwaters.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project offers a valuable training experience in both experimental and theoretical methods for graduate and undergraduate students.  Dr. Adam Fiedler collaborates with local teachers to engage high-school students in activities that combine chemistry with artistic expression.  This outreach program exposes students to concepts and instrumentation used in the project, thereby increasing scientific literacy and the chances that students pursue college degrees in science. <br/><br/>With funding from the CSDM-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Adam Fiedler of Marquette University is developing synthetic iron-containing complexes that mimic key features of nonheme iron dioxygenases.  Dioxygenases that cleave carbon-carbon bonds are critical for the microbial degradation and assimilation of organic compounds that arise from both natural and human sources.  However, the O2 activation mechanisms employed by these enzymes are not fully understood. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the geometric and electronic factors that govern the reactivity of pivotal intermediates featuring superoxo, peroxo, and/or substrate radical ligands.  This project combines coordination chemistry, reaction kinetics, spectroscopic techniques, and computational methods to illuminate the complex relationships between structure and reactivity in bio-inspired iron complexes, including transient intermediates of catalytic significance.  In addition, new approaches for incorporating well-defined second- and third-sphere ligand architectures are developed.  These efforts provide fundamental knowledge regarding O2 activation processes in a variety of metalloenzymes and aid in the design of new oxidation catalysts.  The methods used in this research offer interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate-level scientists.

In this CAREER project, Dr. Ryan J. Rafferty at Kansas State University focuses on the design of molecules that can cross biological barriers. Living organisms make use of barriers for defense against foreign substances and to control the transport of chemical substances.  Two examples of such barriers are the blood-brain barrier and the membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  Dr. Rafferty synthesizes molecules that have multiple, different chemical functional groups that influence the transport properties of various species through membranes. The research aims to identify systematic approaches for the design and synthesis of new classes of ""universal"" molecular transporters that can carry other molecules through biological barriers. For example, the new transporters could deliver imaging agents to explore the structure and function of the brain or therapeutic agents into disease-causing bacteria.  The educational plan is designed to lower the barriers to broader participation in STEM fields. Dr. Rafferty uses research topics as examples of real-world applications in undergraduate chemistry classes.  Public outreach is incorporated as a major teaching strategy in a new undergraduate/graduate Chemical Biology course.  The broader outreach plan draws high school students to science through the K-State Annual Chemistry & Physics Symposium and Summer Research Bootcamps.  The general public is engaged in this research through the Flint Hills Discovery Center. <br/><br/>The movement of compounds across the complex biological membranes of gram-negative bacteria and the blood-brain barrier has been shown to be highly dependent upon physicochemical properties of the molecular transporters. However, the effects of individual physicochemical or spatial properties on transport across these barriers have not been systematically studied. The goal of this research project is to develop new chaperone-like small molecules (CLSMs) that facilitate general transport across complex biological barriers. To do so, Dr. Rafferty develops new molecular scaffolds as well new chemical screening libraries to explore single and combinational physicochemical properties.  He also correlates these properties to the transport functions of the new molecules across blood-brain barrier and/or gram-negative bacteria. For example, the new transporters could deliver imaging agents to explore the structure and function of the brain or therapeutic agents into disease-causing bacteria. The research is well suited to the education and training of a diverse group of students and scholars. The Rafferty lab pursues activities that raise the awareness of the public of the value of science and research and that attract new students into the STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A special focus of the synthetic effort is the donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) dyads, where D and A are respectively alkynyls capped with appropriate electron donor and acceptor, and B is the M(cyclam) unit. Besides the establishment of molecular geometry through single crystal X-ray diffraction, the degree of donor-acceptor interaction and its impact on redox and photophysical properties is assessed using voltammetric, spectroelectrochemical and steady-state emission spectroscopic techniques. Through the collaboration with both colleagues at Purdue and elsewhere, the investigators explore the attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer within the D-B-A dyad using both pump-probe and pump-pump-probe techniques.

Dr. Michael Gonsior and colleagues at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborate with Dr. Susan Richardson at the University of South Carolina. They study the formation of chemical compounds that arise during disinfection of seawater, which is required before water can be used in major desalination plants in the U.S. and Australia. Desalination is an important method for turning salt water into drinkable (potable) water in many parts of the world. It is becoming an increasingly important treatment technology as freshwater supplies are becoming scarcer. However, currently potentially harmful organic compounds produced during disinfection treatments are discharged into the aquatic environment in the waste water stream. The consequences of these organic compounds to aquatic organisms are largely unknown. This study provides new knowledge regarding the formation of previously unknown disinfection by-products (DBPs) produced during desalination. New quantification methods for organic compounds in aqueous environments are also developed. Undergraduate students are exposed to this research through internships, such as through the Maryland Sea Grant REU program and at USC. The CBL Visitor Center host displays about seawater DBPs, how they are formed and what impact they may have on the coastal ocean. In partnership with the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory Visitor Center, the research team hosts a summer workshop for 7-12th grade school students/teachers. The investigators also collaborate with colleagues in the U.S, Australia, and Germany, including industry partners from major desalination plants.<br/><br/>Future reliance on desalination and water reuse to provide suitable drinking water is expected globally.  During the desalination process, chlorination of water is required to limit biofouling of membranes and to kill potentially harmful bacteria. The formation of Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water chlorination and the compounding factors presented by different sources of fresh water, such as high levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM), is well recognized. However, during the chlorination of seawater, hundreds of brominated and iodinated compounds are formed, few of which have been characterized, and some of which are already known to be highly toxic. The researchers utilize new analytical techniques to investigate the production, fate and toxicity of DBPs in the coastal environment. Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has been utilized to describe complex organic matrices at the molecular level, and has successfully demonstrated the complexity of DBPS formed after chlorination of ship ballast water as well as characterizing DOM in natural waters. All of these studies have shown that highly precise mass measurements combined with soft ionization are capable of assigning unambiguous and exact molecular formulas. In combination with traditional gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry methods to support quantification of a subset of compounds, the team characterizes DBPs at different steps of the desalination process and evaluates the fate of produced DBPs released into the environment. The students and faculty combine desalination plant measurements with controlled laboratory studies to better understand the mechanisms and factors contributing to the production, fate and the toxicity of known and newly discovered DBPs formed in seawater during pre-chlorination and accumulated in waste waters discharged into coastal ecosystems."

Professor Xu is improving the spatial resolution of stimulated Raman microscopy so that objects with dimensions approaching those of large molecules can be chemically characterized on a routine basis, and in a highly robust and reliable fashion. Specifically, this project examines aerosols in the atmosphere that may contain harmful substances that can impair the health of individuals by causing respiratory illness, heart failure, or even prenatal defects. Understanding the composition, origin, and transformation of aerosols is of vital importance for reducing their production or lessening their affects. In addition to studying aerosols, Dr. Xu's team is also developing an educational module that connects cutting-edge scientific research laboratories with elementary and high school students in a standard classroom setting, via immersive virtual reality experiences. A range of chemical reactions are demonstrated to elementary and high school students through virtual reality streaming, thereby promoting their curiosity for science.

The project is addressing this need for super-resolution Raman microscopy by combining scanning probe microscopy and coherent stimulated Raman events. Chemical sensitivity is provided by the stimulated Raman process.  High spatial resolution is achieved by nanoscale probing using a scanning probe microscope tip. The project aims to achieve robust and reliable Raman imaging so as to differentiate objects separated by roughly 10 nanometers. Through integration of nanoscale infrared imaging techniques invented by the Xu group, multimodal spectroscopic and mechanical microscopy are possible for chemical, biological, and environmental samples.

The specific focus of the research is to convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, providing a pathway to turn CO2 from a harmful waste product into a major feedstock in industrial processes that synthesize valuable carbon-based products and fuels. Carbon monoxide is currently generated primarily by burning fossil fuel resources; however this research takes an alternative approach, using energy in the form of electricity, which has the potential to capitalize on energy generation by solar energy collection and other renewable-energy production methods. As a result, the goals of this research represent an important broader societal impact towards accessing carbon-neutral cycles for chemical materials and fuels. The latter may enable the expanded use of renewable resources for energy, enhancing our national energy independence and reducing reliance on fossil fuel resources. Professor Yang is also involved in several outreach programs that inspire excitement about experimental science in K-12 students, with an emphasis on traditionally underrepresented or under-served populations. The goals of these programs are to encourage science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers in order to broaden the base of future professionals necessary for continued national technological innovation and growth. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jenny Y. Yang of the University of California, Irvine is synthesizing a series of transition metal complexes with ligands that contain proximate Lewis acid functionality. The transition metal center and Lewis acid functionality are positioned for cooperative activation of CO2 reduction. This type of cooperative CO2 activation is inspired by the active site of the nickel-iron [NiFe] carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, which catalyze the reduction of CO2 to CO at high rates, selectivity, and efficiency. The goals are to 1) investigate the cooperative effect of proximate Lewis acids in transition metal complexes towards the activation of CO2 at mild reduction potentials, and 2) apply this knowledge toward the development of abundant metal electrocatalysts for fast and efficient CO2 reduction to CO. The first goal furnishes information generally applicable for CO2 activation to reduced products. The second goal focuses on reduction to CO, a versatile C1 precursor for fuels and other high value products. New catalysts for CO2 reduction have significant broader impact, since they are beneficial for CO2 recycling in renewable energy fuel cycles or incorporation into useful materials. Progress is quantitatively measured by improvements in catalyst rate, stability, selectivity, and overpotential (efficiency). Dr. Yang is also actively involved in several outreach programs that instruct and excite students about STEM careers in K-12 students. This CAREER award fosters the development of teacher-scholars at the start of their scientific careers."

It is widely available (a component of the air we breathe), strongly oxidizing, and produces non-toxic byproducts (e.g., water). Fundamental challenges prevent widespread use of O2 in synthetic chemistry. New strategies that enable greater utilization of O2 are critical to developing sustainable synthetic methods. In this project, Dr. Powers is developing synthetic methods to use O2 to generate hypervalent iodine compounds, a class of useful chemical oxidants. The successful preparation of hypervalent iodine compounds from O2 helps achieve the goal of greater O2 utilization. The idea is that O2, which normally does not react with iodobenzene to make these hypervalent iodine reagents but does so in the presence of sacrificial aldehydes and a cobalt halide catalyst.  Three research areas are proposed: improve understanding of the ensuing organic applications, innovate on routes and structures to the reagents, and couple the use of the iodine reagents with diverse dirhodium catalysts, as well as metal organic frameworks and nanoparticles, to effect C-H activations. These reactions are important to the chemical industry - ranging from the advanced manufacturing of new pharmaceuticals to other chemicals of commercial importance.  Dr. Powers is also creating new programs to expand participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. For example, open-access educational resources for community college curricula are being developed.

By diverting reactive intermediates generated during aldehyde autoxidation chemistry, O2 reduction can be directly coupled to the synthesis of hypervalent iodine compounds. Application of those aerobically generated intermediates in catalysis enables the broad substrate functionalization of hypervalent iodine reagents to be coupled to O2 reduction. These reactions are applicable to advanced chemical manufacturing techniques as they are more potential more sustainable and less expensive than current techniques used in pharmaceuticals and commercial chemical manufacturing.

The systems of interest have several electrons that influence each other in ways that lead to many states with similar energies.  Systems of this type are called ""strongly-correlated"" and can exhibit novel properties which have the potential to spur technological advancement in a number of fields. However, these systems are challenging to theoretically describe and are often intractable for current computational methods. Professor Scuseria's group is developing a new approach that is accurate and can be applied to large, realistic systems, all the while giving superior results for strongly correlated systems. The researchers are working both to continue to develop the new approach and to apply the method to important systems like transition-metal clusters and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in order to provide useful insights into technologically-relevant systems. Dr. Scuseria is involved in outreach activities in the Houston area.  Specifically he is organizing events with the Latin American Graduate Student Association at Rice University.  He provides informal advice about job opportunities in academia as well as in industry.  Dr. Scuseria is also involved in the Rice Science Cafe, where ideas about science and technology are discussed with the general public. <br/><br/>Strong correlations are ubiquitous and technologically important, but unfortunately cannot be accurately described except by a handful of computational approaches.  One of the more promising approaches for the treatment of strong correlation is the use of symmetry projection, i.e. recovering the symmetry-preserving component of a broken-symmetry wavefunction. Symmetry projection is black box, and symmetry projected mean-field methods can be applied to systems with dozens or even hundreds of strongly correlated electrons. In order to reach quantitative accuracy for strongly-correlated systems, the Scuseria group is working to extend their symmetry projected mean-field methods to symmetry projected coupled cluster theory. This theory combines the advantages of symmetry projection for the description of strong correlation on the one hand with coupled cluster theory for the description of weak correlation on the other, becoming a form of black-box multireference coupled cluster theory. The new approach has the potential to efficiently and reliably treat weak and strong correlations on equal footing while affording the straightforward computation of properties and other expectation values. While the Scuseria group continues to develop and extend symmetry projected coupled cluster theory, their current applications of the approach are strongly correlated systems which display spin frustration and accompanying magnetic order, which should provide valuable insights for future technological development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This would have tremendous impact on future optoelectronic, energy, and sensing technologies. Prof. Maldonado of the University of Michigan has developed a method to synthesize crystalline semiconductor nanomaterials without high temperatures or caustic reagents. This singular approach is called the electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) strategy and it works by blending two normally distinct strategies, electrochemistry and melt crystal growth. Among many salient features, the ec-LLS strategy can be performed at or near room temperature in water and the ambient atmosphere. This work aims to further develop the ec-LLS concept into a transformative methodology for environmentally-friendly and low cost semiconductor manufacture. Experiments are designed to identify the controlling features in ec-LLS that dictate crystal shape, size, and purity. The basic science proposed here accordingly spans electrochemistry, materials science, advanced electron microscopy, and X-ray spectroscopic methods, offering extensive training in these areas for participating undergraduate and graduate students. Through this project, Prof. Maldonado also expands pedagogical tools for teaching basic chemistry and electrochemistry to beginning students. Specifically, electrodeposited thin films are introduced as platforms for preparing solar cells for the education of high school students.<br/><br/>The funding support provided by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular & Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is advancing knowledge and control over the electrochemical synthesis of semiconductor nanomaterials with liquid metals. Specifically, the electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) concept for the syntheses of crystalline covalent semiconductors  offers a unique way to form technologically relevant semiconductor nanomaterials under unusually benign reaction conditions. A liquid metal is both a working electrode that facilitates heterogeneous reduction reactions and a solvent that directs semiconductor crystal growth. The purpose of this project is to gain predictive influence over the structure, physicochemical, and electrical properties of the resultant materials. The underlying research focus uses two orthogonal methods, in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in-situ X-ray spectroscopy, to study systematically the operational features of crystal growth in ec-LLS. The chief overarching hypotheses to be tested are: (1) the extent of supersaturation in ec-LLS, rather than the specific liquid metal, most strongly dictates the form of the crystal growth and (2) the structure of the liquid metal at the electrode/electrolyte interface impacts how ec-LLS initiates. The first hypothesis is being investigated by visualizing ec-LLS syntheses of semiconductor nanowires under a variety of conditions by in-situ TEM with a liquid holder. The second hypothesis is being explored through shallow angle X-ray reflection and diffraction studies of liquid metal/liquid electrolyte interfaces during the initial stages of ec-LLS. Through the combination of these different methods, more refined ec-LLS methods are being developed to synthesize more advanced nanomaterials. Prof. Maldonado's undergraduate laboratory curriculum on perovskite solar cells is being adapted for high school students. The intent is to simplify electrodeposition platforms sufficiently so that even very beginning students can contribute meaningfully to original materials chemistry research on photovoltaics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It represents a collaboration between Dr. Joseph Pignatello at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Professor Klaus Schmidt-Rohr at Brandeis University, and Professor Jingdong Mao at Old Dominion University. Together with their postdocs and graduate students, they investigate properties and behavior of biomass chars in the environment. Biochar particles are partially burned plant matter with blackened surfaces.  Char results from natural and deliberately-set fires and are common components of soil and aquatic sediments. Activated carbon (a form of charcoal) and biochar can be beneficial soil additives for use in agricultural processes. Important attributes of chars include their ability to strongly bind pollutant and to change the identity of the pollutant molecules. Air may be present or absent during the charring process. It is usually present during the weathering of chars in the environment. The oxygen in air can have major effects on the physical and chemical properties of chars and can impact their functions as materials that absorb and change pollutants. This research examines the absorption and change in pollutants on biochar surfaces using carefully controlled experiments at both room temperatures and higher temperatures. This project provides benefits to society by studying how biomass chars affect the fate of pollutants in the environment. It also provides valuable information that may be useful in efforts to clean up contaminated sites, as well as in agricultural applications. In addition to fostering the training of students and postdoctoral fellows, this project incorporates a visiting scholars program for PhD students and professors, an internship program for undergraduate students, an Honors College program to foster involvement of undergraduate students in active research, and mentorship programs for high school students. The project has strong outreach and education components directed at engaging prospective scientists among historically disadvantaged groups, especially at Old Dominion University, which is an urban campus with a significant minority population.<br/><br/>Biomass chars are ubiquitous components of soil and sediment from fires and also have attracted interest as soil amendments in agriculture and environmental remediation. Important attributes of chars include their ability to effectively adsorb organic and inorganic compounds and to mediate electron transfer reactions to/from or between organic species. Air present during or after pyrolysis can have major effects on the physical-chemical properties of chars that impact these functions, yet this subject has received<br/>little attention. The objectives of this project are to determine the underlying structural and chemical alterations of char caused by both thermal and ambient air oxidation (AO), and to determine the effects of these alterations critical to their interactions with emerging pollutants. In the laboratory chars are made from wood and switchgrass. The test compounds are phosphate, arsenate, arsenite, selenite, aquatic herbicides (diquat and paraquat), and model organic compounds. Advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is employed to identify and quantify changes in functional group composition and fused aromatic ring size. This also allows detection of signals coming from exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds formed between surface groups and weak acid adsorbates. NMR sensitivities are enhanced by using 13C-enriched switchgrass as the biomass precursor and 13C-labelled compounds as adsorbates. The project investigates the consequences of air oxidation on the formation of exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds. It also addresses cation exchange interactions, dissolved organic matter competition for adsorption sites, oxidation-reduction reactions mediated by chars, and the concentrations of persistent free radicals formed by the pyrolysis process. The findings are expected to provide novel insights for char structure and weak acid solute behavior in the environment.  The project has outreach and education components and aims to engage students among historically disadvantaged groups."

The research and educational goals in the Pomerantz lab address long-standing questions about biomolecular communications between proteins, drawing from findings in the disciplines of both chemistry and biology. Proteins termed transcription factors are the master regulators of cellular function. They facilitate the complicated transfer of information that specifies how the DNA code is used to make proteins. This research seeks to understand the details of the interactions between proteins and their underlying biology. The element fluorine will be used as a sensitive reporter for difficult-to-detect interactions at protein interfaces. This method is advantageous in view of fluorine's unique spectroscopic properties and its absence in natural biological molecules. Given the importance of transcription factors, this fluorine-based approach for studying protein-ligand interactions could significantly increase the repertoire of new protein targets for study and thereby open up avenues for improving the understanding of a wide variety of protein function. This project will include training for students with no prior experience of working at the chemistry/biology interface and will engage the Osher Life-Long Learning community's interests in science literacy and the role of chemical biology in science and technology. <br/><br/>This research project is focused on the development of fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) methods for detecting, quantifying, and defining novel modes of interactions at transcription factor-protein interfaces that include epigenetic regulatory proteins. Due to the enrichment of aromatic amino acids at protein-binding sites, multiple labeling strategies for sequence selective incorporation of fluorinated aromatic amino acids will be evaluated for reporting on protein binding interactions. The hyper-responsiveness of the fluorine nucleus to changes in chemical environment leads to simplified 1D-biomolecular NMR spectra that can be rapidly acquired and readily interpreted. This method will be evaluated against known ligands to characterize their mode of interaction and also in discovery format using small molecule libraries. These studies will be extended to acquiring mechanistic information under physiological conditions by in-cell fluorine-19 NMR.  The origins of cellular uptake of fluorine-labeled peptide macrocylces will be investigated using lanthanide shift reagents for differentiating extracellular versus internalized peptides. This fluorine-19 NMR method will set the stage for use as a structure-based tool to find new chemical probes for challenging protein-protein interactions. Given the importance of transcription factors, the proposed fluorine-19 NMR approach to study protein-ligand interactions could significantly increase the repertoire of new protein targets opening up avenues for improving the understanding of their biology."

His research program is combined with the development of new educational tools that can be used to explain complex concepts to science learners.  On the research front, Professor Mohr and his students seek to control the behavior of highly reactive molecules that contain either an unpaired electron or an anion. These ""intermediates"" are formed and then converted into the production of target molecules where the specific spatial arrangement of the atoms required is difficult to obtain using currently available methods. This project contributes to the fields of organic synthesis, organometallic chemistry, and physical organic chemistry and builds new molecules with potential long-range applications in medicine, agriculture, biochemistry, and materials science. On the educational front, Professor Mohr is working to educate young students through outreach activities that involve children in grades K-12 students, and to increase laboratory research opportunities for underrepresented students. Within this overall effort is a plan to introduce the concept of catalysis to middle school students. Catalysts are molecules that help reactions proceed faster toward desirable targets while not being consumed. By helping students to understand how catalysts react, Professor Mohr is able to teach the students many of the key concepts that form the foundation of modern chemical methods. Professor Mohr's education plan also includes an effort to identify college age organic chemistry students that are prone to have difficulty with spatial recognition tasks. Such difficulties can impede their education, so his plan is to identify the problem early so that extra help can be provided to the students in a timely fashion so as to ensure their long-term success. <br/><br/>First-row transition metals are attractive catalysts for generating reactive organic radical intermediates.  These radical species are particularly suited to novel regio- and stereoselective coupling reactions with conjugated alkenes.  This research seeks to develop new variants of such transformations that have specific uses in the synthesis of complex molecules applicable to the synthesis of natural products, functional materials, agrochemicals, and biochemical probes. This approach explores control of site-selectivity in reactions of conjugated dienolates.  The research uses insights into the electronic structure of these anionic intermediates to overcome the typical selectivity in the location of bond formation with ambident nucleophiles.  Use of this concept to synthesize organofluorine compounds reveals an unprecedented stereocontrol element with the potential to generate valuable, stereochemically rich organofluorine compounds.  The research also seeks to understand the fundamental chemical concepts that explain this novel stereocontrol effect.  The educational plan makes use of chemical reactivity as a platform to introduce the concept of metal catalysis to middle school students through a tangible demonstration.  A second portion of the educational plan seeks to identify students at risk for difficulty in learning stereochemical concepts and to provide early interventions that improve educational outcomes.

In collaborations with Dr. John Heinrich of Revolution NMR, LLC, the team is specifically targeting analysis of substances of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, although the target improvements will have wide-ranging impact across the many disciplines that use SSNMR in almost all fields of chemistry. The industrial collaborations add value by promoting rapid dissemination and application of the technologies being developed.  They also enhance the interdisciplinary nature of the work, providing exceptionally broad educational opportunities for the graduate and undergraduate students (including members of underrepresented groups) performing and presenting this research.  To expand this impact even further, the Munson/Rossini team is 1) providing short courses for graduate students and postdocs, addressing the basics of solid-state NMR and its applications to pharmaceutical and material science; 2) establishing a visiting scientist program to enable for students, industrial representatives, and members of government agencies to learn the advanced techniques being developed; and 3) reaching out to other disciplines, such as chemical engineering, food science, and agriculture to highlight how new developments in NMR can be used to solve their problems. <br/><br/>Three approaches are being employed to improve the sensitivity, resolution, and general capabilities of SSNMR of crystalline and amorphous organic compounds (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients). 1) Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is known to increase sensitivity by orders of magnitude.  Drs. Munson and Rossini are working to optimize these effects by studying the impact of particle size and phase separation in amorphous solid dispersions. One aim is to establish a means of identifying and differentiating polymorphic forms. 2) A mechanical magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR probe operable at liquid nitrogen temperatures to lower the cost of these kinds of experiments while retaining or enhancing the ability to control the environment in the MAS rotor.  It is anticipated that this will provide about an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity compared to a standard NMR probe operating at 298 K, as well as improved radiofrequency performance. 3) The team is working to improve the resolution of SSNMR spectra by using two-dimensional proton-carbon heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (HETCOR)."

The ultimate goal of the work is the discovery of design principles for the construction of molecular machines and molecular-sized devices that can more easily integrate with existing technologies.  A goal is to gain a better understanding of molecular motion.  Control of molecular motion is crucial for the design of new approaches for unique new applications, including tiny molecular-sized pumps, sensors, and optoelectronics. To engage broad audiences in this project, the Sykes research team gives presentations about nanoscienceat local high schools with newly developed demonstrations.  YouTube videos featuring the project results are produced. The group has developed a Science Fair between Tufts and Medford High which enables ~300 students per year to interact with graduate researchers about their science project presentations.<br/><br/>Single molecule devices are capable of performing a number of functions from mechanical motion to simple computation.  Their utility is somewhat limited, however, by difficulties associated with coupling them with either each other or with interfaces such as electrodes.  This project takes a new approach using molecular self-assembly to produce 2D crystalline arrays of molecular rotors that display emergent properties like correlated rotational switching.  The arrays are synthesized by the Ullmann reaction of precursor molecular rotors with a Cu (111) surface, yielding 2D networks of metal-organic complexes in which the rotary units can interact with each other.  Scanning tunneling microscopy enables excitation of the individual rotor groups and the ability to study how reorientation of an individual molecular rotor affects its neighbors.  By studying the effect of voltage, current, and tunneling gap distance on rotor motion, the mechanism of excitation will be explored.  Altering the size and functionality of the precursor molecules enables control over the placement of the rotor units in the 2D molecular crystals and the ability to study the effect of rotor-rotor spacing and angle on correlated rotational switching.  By changing the functionality of the rotor itself, both steric and dipolar coupling will be explored.  Finally, chiral rotary units will be introduced as a way to induce unidirectional rotation via a flashing temperature ratchet-like mechanism."

Formation of beta-sheets has been implicated in amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.  Although there are existing model systems for beta-sheets, their use has been limited because these model systems aggregate and become insoluble, making them difficult to study.  Professor Curran and his students have discovered a rigid, cyclic molecule that incorporates the metals, iron and tungsten, and they have discovered ways to append two short protein chains to this cyclic molecule.  These protein chains are aligned parallel to each other.  The goal of this research is to determine whether the two protein chains linked to the rigid cyclic molecule will form beta-sheets, and whether changes to the iron and tungsten atoms can prevent the problem of aggregation.  If successful this work will enable other researchers to better understand the forces that drive beta-sheet formation.   The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic and biochemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of undergraduate science students.  Undergraduate co-workers, including those from groups underrepresented in sciences, and some high school students will take part in this funded project.<br/><br/>Tungsten bis(alkyne)complexes are ununsual in that they are air stable. In general, the alkyne ligands rotate around the tungsten center; this is true for both acyclic and cyclic complexes. In recent work, a cyclic tungsten bis(alkyne) complex derived from a dialkynyl 1,1'-disubstitutedferrocene has been discovered and found to rather rigidly juxtapose the two alkyne ligands in solution.  The rigid nature of this ring system and its ability to hold the two alkynes in close proximity will be used to explore whether peptides appended to the two alkynes will develop cross-strand hydrogen bonds and adopt beta-sheet conformations.  Peptides will be appended to the alkynes via amide bonds made to either methyleneamine or methylenecarboxyl linkers.  If these peptide derivatives do adopt beta-sheet conformations, then their ability to aggregate will be assessed.  If aggregation is observed, oxidation of the iron atom in the ferrocene moiety will be examined to determine whether charge-charge repulsion can disrupt aggregation.  The long-term goal of this work is to develop a model system for studying beta-sheets and the factors that contribute to their aggregation."

The process employs thio-bromo substitution reactions to convert alpha-bromoester-containing polynorbornenes and poly(oxanorbornene)s to polymers with functionality (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, and ionic groups) known to instill water-swellability to macromolecular architectures.  Cross-linking of the resulting polymers with dithiols produces a new class of hydrogels.   While the preparation of alpha-bromoester-containing polynorbornenes and poly(oxanorbornene)s by Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) requires the use of a ruthenium catalyst, the conversion of these polymers to hydrogels involves metal-free reactions that minimize the use of precious metals.

Fuels are compounds that react with an oxidant, usually oxygen, to release energy. At the molecular level, when a fuel is burned, the bonds in high energy compounds rearrange to form new bonds in lower energy compounds, and the energy released in this bond rearrangement is used to power our world. Most fuels in our society are derived from coal, oil and natural gas; namely fossil fuels, the bonds of which are rearranged with the bonds of oxygen to generate carbon dioxide and water, which enter the atmosphere.  One way to avoid the formation of carbon dioxide is to cut the connection between fuels and carbon and to use hydrogen as a fuel. There are two sources of hydrogen that can be generated using solar irradiation: water or hydrohalic acid (for example, a hydrogen atom bonded to a chlorine atom); however, hydrogen cannot be generated by shining light directly on water or hydrohalic acid. A catalyst must be used that will capture the light and then act as an intermediary in the bond rearrangement reaction. Professor Nocera is developing new catalysts that can absorb light and then convert hydrohalic acids into hydrogen and elemental halogen.  The new compounds, reactions and techniques resulting from this research are likely to impact realted areas of science and could result in new energy generation technologies.  Professor Nocera continues to be involved in raising public awareness of the global energy problem and the role that science, and especially chemistry, can play in addressing the energy challenge. Research discoveries in this area are being conveyed to the public through a variety of forums including news media, radio programs, movies and other broadcast venues. <br/><br/>The  Nocera group is developing new catalysts for photochemical HX splitting and, in parallel,  is studying the mechanisms of such reactions.  The storage of renewable energy in the form of fuels requires the rearrangement of bonds with low energy content to ones of high energy content, and bonds of important energy consequence are H-H, X-X and O=O. New metal compounds based on Rh, Ni, Fe and Mn are being synthesized that can provide insight into these energy conversion processes. Critical intermediates that promote the requisite bond activation are being studied using advanced spectroscopic techniques, including the application of time-resolved X-ray crystallography and nanoparticle-based time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy for the identification of the critical M-H and M-X intermediates, and magnetic resonance techniques (intermediate-field ENDOR, ELDOR-detected NMR and single-crystal polarized neutron diffraction) for the identification of M-O intermediates. With knowledge of the stereoelectronic properties of the critical intermediates, photocycles are being constructed to drive energetically uphill reactions, which are at the basis for renewable energy conversion."

Interfaces have unique chemical properties that cannot be described by gas or liquid properties. The preferential allocation of ions to the interface, a process not observed in liquids, is believed to have a strong impact on heterogeneous reactions. This project utilizes spectroscopic and computation methods to examine the structures of polyatomic ions. Interfacial properties (affinity, interfacial-core partitioning, and ion depth) are quantified. The approach uses reverse micelles (aqueous droplets in a non-polar liquid) as model systems for atmospheric aerosols. The quantification of the interfacial properties of polyatomic ions improves our knowledge of heterogeneous chemistry and the predictive accuracy of atmospheric chemistry models."

Oxidizing agents are important tools for the construction of a wide variety of molecules. The approach Professor Zhdankin and his group is developing utilizes polyvalent iodine compounds because they are efficient and environmentally more ""friendly"" that the reagents currently used. The iodine based systems work because iodine is one of the heaviest elements in the Periodic Table classified as a non-metal. Hence, these more sustainable reagents mimic the structural features and reactivity pattern heavy, frequently toxic transition metals they are being used to replace. It is also important to note that the reagents are new. As such, they can be used to not only replicate existing methods, but also to develop entirely new reactions. The project lies at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry and it is well suited for undergraduate education as well as for training of scientists at all levels. Professor Zhdankin's group has a long history of providing the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>Professor Zhdankin and his group are pursuing a broad study of new, metal-free, iodine-mediated reactions. In this effort, they are searching for new hypervalent reagents, and they are exploring the new modes of reactivity those reagents enable.  Specific objectives of this project include the study of arylbenziodoxaboroles as efficient benzyne precursors, the development of new carbene precursors based on phenolic iodonium salts, the study of arylation reactions with phenolic diaryliodonium salts, and the study of phosphonium-iodonium ylides as reagents for synthesis of trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes. In a second effort, Professor Zhdankin is searching for stable and potentially useful hypervalent iodine complexes with mesoionic carbenes. The new synthetic methodology based on organohypervalent iodine chemistry is contributing to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as it utilizes non-toxic compounds of iodine as catalysts or recyclable reagents in aqueous solutions.  Successful development of this methodology is having an impact on how the synthesis of molecules relevant to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries is approached.

Ashfeld. Professor Ashfeld is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame, and is developing new synthetic methods that enable construction of functionalized heterocyclic and carbocyclic frameworks that contain very difficult to synthesize tetrasubstituted carbons. Cyclic systems that contain tetrasubstituted (or quaternary) carbons are found in a great number of molecules used in biological and materials science settings. Yet in spite of their importance, these ring systems remain difficult to synthesize, especially if they need to be constructed as a single ""right-handed"" or left-handed"" mirror image in order to control molecular interactions with a biological system. To address this issue, Professor Ashfeld and his students are developing new methods for constructing both the hetero- and carbocyclic systems and the highly hindered quaternary carbons they contain. These methods take advantage of a transition metal catalyzed formal [4+1]-cycloaddition between a single carbon unit and a polarized four atom substrate. The catalyst used is chiral so that the reaction affords predominately one mirror image of the product. The project outcomes are broadly impacting the disciplines of synthetic and physical organic, organometallic, medicinal, and materials chemistry both in terms of the methods developed and the products generated. The scientific goals of the project integrate seamlessly with the education/outreach pursuits through the implementation of a target-based pedagogical philosophy toward STEM education at the secondary and post-secondary levels. These educational efforts are being complimented by Professor Ashfeld's contributions to the Upward Bound College Preparatory program in South Bend Indiana that serve to extend the program's reach beyond his labs to the larger community.<br/><br/>Quaternary stereogenic carbons and carbo- and heterocycles are pervasive architectures across numerous facets of academic and industrial chemical research. Despite the ubiquitous presence of 5-membered carbocycles and heterocycles in medicinal chemistry (e.g., CNS drugs, analgesics, antibiotics, etc.) and materials science (e.g., ionic liquids, high energy materials, etc.), the number of reliable methods for the assembly of highly substituted rings with flexible site-specific functionalization capabilities is relatively limited. Additionally, the synthesis of quaternary carbon centers is far from trivial, and to do so with control of absolute stereochemistry remains a significant obstacle in target-directed synthesis. Using the biologically active spirooxindole alkaloids as a motivating template for design, this project concurrently addresses these challenges through the development of a transition metal-catalyzed, formal [4+1]-cycloaddition for the fragment coupling of a diazo compound with a vinyl ketene to access cyclopentenones bearing a neighboring quaternary center, and vinyl isocyanates to construct the N-heterocyclic counterpart. By employing a well-defined chiral ligand-metal complex, assembly of the quaternary ring stereogenic carbon in a stereocontrolled fashion while acting as a point of spiro-attachment en route to numerous oxindole alkaloids, is tenable. Due to the chemoselective nature of the transition metal catalyst and relatively mild reaction conditions, this retrosynthetic disconnect is broadly applicable to a diverse array of synthetic targets. Completion of this study will ultimately lead to improved synthetic efficiency toward these important molecular scaffolds, and lay the keystone for long term significance in stereoselective quaternary carbon and carbo/heterocycle formation. The educational plan will integrate our findings in the training of graduate students in their approach toward synthesis, and the introduction of undergraduates to synthetic methods in laboratory offerings. The incorporation of a target-based approach toward molecule construction, such as quaternary carbon and heterocycle synthesis with tangible applications (i.e. pharmacophores), rather than the traditional reaction-centered lab design prevalent today, is an immediate goal. Graduate and undergraduates alike will gain a better appreciation for reaction design, and the discovery of new chemical reactivity, if their focus is on a series of specified target functionalities that are translational in nature."

The common theme in these newly developed chemical transformations is that weak N-O bonds are broken and strong carbon-carbon as well as carbon-nitrogen bonds are formed with great efficiency.

Ions are charged atomic or molecular species that can dissolve in solvents like water or organic liquids.  Ions are important in a very broad range of natural and technological systems.  Table salt is the most common everyday example, but ions of many kinds figure prominently in electrochemistry, colloids, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Not all ions are the same; in fact, the ion identity (through its size, shape, and chemistry) can dramatically affect the properties of a given system.  The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of what causes such large differences between ionic species.  This research aids in developing more accurate models for how the ions interact with solvents such as water or organic liquids (such as ethylene carbonate, the solvent in the lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in every electronic device).  Towards this end, Beck and his coworkers employ accurate models that come from the fundamental theory of nature, quantum mechanics.  Their goal is to learn about basic aspects of ion solvation and then produce reliable models that can help understand problems like atmospheric chemistry and the development of longer-lasting batteries.  The educational component of this project centers on continued development of a course on sustainable energy.  Professor Beck is currently the chair of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users. <br/> <br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water and organic solvents.  Ion solvation figures prominently in surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Beck and his coworkers aim to establish a fundamental energy scale for single-ion solvation.  This allows for a firmer groundwork for studying specific ion effects.  The research also leads to the development of better classical models that can be applied to much larger systems such as sea salt aerosols and improved batteries.  The behavior of ions near interfaces is an essential aspect of all of these problems.  The research has four objectives: to study ions in water, in organic solvents, and in biological channels, and to further develop a new stochastic algorithm for quantum simulations on parallel computers.  The study of ions in water leads to the accurate prediction of the effective surface potential of water, a long sought quantity in condensed phase chemistry.  This work employs ab initio quantum simulations and quasi-chemical theory to obtain quantitative estimates of the bulk and real hydration free energies.  The study of ions in organic solvents applies the same ideas to ions in ethylene carbonate, a key electrolyte in Li-ion batteries.  That research improves current models for these systems.  The study of ions in biological channels examines the interaction of protons and chloride ions in the bacterial CLC channel protein.  The development of stochastic algorithims may lead to a new forward-looking algorithm for large-scale quantum simulations. The method employs stochastic differential equations to solve for the one-particle density matrix.  Besides the scientific impacts, the research broadly impacts education through development of a course on sustainable energy and leadership of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users."

Metal particles are commonly used as catalysts in commercial chemical processes. They selectively convert reactants to the desired product, reduce production of wasteful byproducts, increase reaction rate, and lower energy requirements. Understanding how catalysts work is a key step toward improving their performance. The problem is challenging, however, due to the wide range of reactant energies, and the many different atomic structures found on a working catalyst. To unravel this complexity, Professor Utz and his students are preparing reactants with precise quantities of energy. They then measure their reactivity on a series of surfaces containing well-defined structures that resemble the features present on a working catalyst. The work is providing a systematic and quantitative understanding of how reactant energy, and surface structure, lead to catalytic activity. Insights gained from the project could advance our ability to design and optimize catalysts, which could have important benefits to society.  The project is also training students in advanced experimental methods and interfacial science, and it is providing outreach activities that stimulate interest, and enrich the K-12 Science and Technology curriculum at local schools.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on the energetics and dynamics of dissociative chemisorption to build a mechanistic picture of catalytic activity. A key goal is to understand how increasing the structural and chemical complexity of the gas phase reagent and the surface affects reactivity.

Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program.  Many problems at the forefront of energy, environmental and biological research demand the quantum mechanical treatment of electrons and nuclei. But the detailed quantum description of such problems is much too complex even in today?s high performance computing environment. This is because the computational complexity in these problems grows exponentially with system size, which makes them intractable.  Iyengar and his research group are developing new computational methods to address these issues. These methods are poised to have major impact on the study of a wide class of problems in biological enzymes, atmospheric chemistry and materials science including study of hydrogen transfer in polymer electrolyte fuel cells.  The methods are at the forefront of modern computational quantum chemistry and chemical physics. Hence students in the PI's group have the opportunity to learn and develop new theoretical methods and apply these methods to important practical problems. The results, involving computer codes as well as novel scientific ideas are widely disseminated to the scientific community. Specifically, the computer programs when completed will appear as part of the NSF-funded SEAGrid science gateway. In addition, the PI continues to initiate participation and mentoring of freshman by chemistry faculty. The PI further envisions homogenizing the chemistry curriculum by developing student directed web-based learning methods to connect the sub-disciplines of chemistry and achieve a continuous rather than discrete education of undergraduates. <br/><br/>Computing accurate classical trajectories and potential surfaces in agreement with high levels of electronic structure for complex chemical systems is a major challenge in computational chemistry and chemical physics.   Iyengar and co-workers are making contributions in this area, including the development of on-the-fly molecular dynamics methods that   allow accurate treatment of electronic structure at the MP2 and Coupled Cluster level, using methods that scale like DFT. Furthermore, they are computing potential surfaces for quantum-mechanical nuclear degrees of freedom that are in good agreement with higher levels of electronic structure methods such as MP2 and Coupled Cluster, at computational costs comparable to DFT. While ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods are appealing because they do not need an a priori fitted potential surface, this advantage is normally precluded since on-the-fly evaluation of potential and forces is a strong computational constraint. Hence most implementations of AIMD are limited to density functional theoretic (DFT) treatment of electronic structure.  The goal of this project is to alleviate this computational constraint and make AIMD more routinely and broadly applicable using efficient methods that allow higher levels of electronic structure, post-Hartree-Fock accuracy. Specifically, the proposal deals with (a) the development of new methods to efficiently compute on-the-fly electronic structure for AIMD and Car-Parrinello-like methods in agreement with MP2, Coupled Cluster and other post-Hartree-Fock methods, (b) the computation of potential surfaces using these approaches to facilitate on-the-fly quantum dynamics. Chemical problems to be studied include, (i) the study conformation dynamics and vibrational properties of protonated water clusters, and (ii) the determination of accurate potential surfaces for reaction paths and quantum wave packet dynamics studies on hydrogen transfer reactions involved in the oxidation pathways of hydroxyl-isoprene, which is a biogenic volatile organic compound."

Insights from these experiments may lead to improved prediction of biological effects at the molecular and potentially cellular levels.  Metallic nanoparticles in the 10-100 nm size range exhibit unusual properties that enable applications in biology, ranging from diagnostics to therapeutics.  The details of the chemistry at the surface of these nanoparticles matter.  Some surface chemistries promote protein binding.  Others discourage protein binding, and some even control how proteins bind to the surface.  The position of molecules such as proteins on the surface of nanoparticles can influence the fate and function of these nanoparticles in biological systems. The project also contributes to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of nanotechnology, bionanotechnology, and analytical measurements.  This training provides a pipeline of well-rounded scientists who contribute to the innovation economy.  Classroom modules on surface chemistry are created and broadly disseminated to enable students to learn about these scientific topics. Outreach to non-science students helps educate non-scientists about bionanotechnology as well as improve the communication skills of the science students.<br/><br/>A wide-ranging set of experiments are designed to examine the phenomenon of ""conformational proteomics on nanoparticles.""  This research group is developing the ability to measure protein conformations and then rationally alter the conformation/orientation of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces.  The systems include gold cores with various organic ligand shells or new porous, constraining shells.  The proteins include a small, carefully selected set of molecules with intrinsically interesting bioactivity.  The methods used include adaptive control of protein behavior that comes from ""plasmonic refreshing"" of the surface or capturing protein conformers in designed pores near the metal surface. The measurement of bound protein conformation and orientation comes from a combination of NMR methods, footprinting mass spectrometry, and vibrational spectroscopy."

When illuminated with light of the proper wavelength, these materials fluoresce in the near infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  This offers lower background signals (and therefore higher sensitivity) and deeper penetration than conventional imaging agents. This in turns enables imaging the inner structures of biological and other, with important potential applications in areas such as environmental science, biology, and national security. Dr. Zhao is reaching out to engage Tribal Colleges and Universities in North Dakota both in this work and more generally.  A key aim is to encourage students from this underrepresented group to consider science as a career option. <br/><br/>The technical objectives of this project are three-fold: 1) Synthesis. The development of a series of graphene-based near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) nanomaterials for sensitive detection and imaging of trace analytes (especially in biosamples). The distinct features of these NIRF nanomaterials are: a) intense fluorescence signals, b) tunable fluorescence wavelengths, c) high water solubility, and d) large surface area. To achieve this goal, the PI is developing new methods for making graphene-based NIRF nanomaterials with various dimensions and reduction levels to fine-tune the fluorescence wavelengths and intensities. 2) Fundamental study. Study of the geometric, compositional, and dimensional effects of graphene materials on their fluorescence properties, including fluorescence quantum yield, lifetime and wavelengths. 3) Application. The implementation of the NIRF nanomaterials in bioanalysis and bioimaging. The NIR region favors low background signals and deeper penetration of radiation. Highly sensitive detection and in vitro/vivo imaging can be accomplished using NIRF nanomaterials. Targeted properties include high quantum yield, tunability of excitation and emission wavelengths, minimal photo-bleaching, and minimal overlap between excitation and emission bands."

Zanni of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is studying charge transfer in tailor-made molecules using a new technique called two-dimensional white-light (2D WL) spectroscopy. Charge transfer processes play a central role in chemistry, such as for delivering electrons to speed up chemical reactions. A detailed understanding of charge transfer is difficult, because one must know the structures of the molecules, how much energy they contain, and how fast the electrons transfer from one place to another. Professor Zanni is addressing this challenge by studying a series of tailor-made molecules with well-defined and systematically varied structures. This series of molecules is being synthesized by the research group of Professor Michael Wasielewski at Northwestern University.  Since these molecules absorb light of different colors, Professor Zanni uses white light spectroscopy to study the energy levels of the molecules and the rates of charge transfer.  White light is a combination of all other colors of visible light. Absorption spectra are graphic descriptions of how atoms or molecules absorb light of different colors (wavelengths).  By exciting the molecules with brief light pulses separated from each other by a few hundred femtoseconds (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second), Professor Zanni is able to generate two-dimensional spectra, which look like topographical maps, and provide clues about how charge and energy are moving within or between molecules.  The insights provided by this research may advance our understanding of charge transfer processes in living systems, and may have implications for the design of materials relevant to solar energy technologies. Professor Zanni and his group are involved in various activities focused on the public science education.  They give presentations at the Wingra Elementary School Science Night and host an Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) high school teacher as part of their research dissemination plan. Professor Zanni and his group have also designed and prepared a televised lecture for Wisconsin Public Television on transitioning technologies from university research into the commercial sphere.<br/><br/>A series of custom-made molecules are being studied by the Zanni research group using a 2D WL spectroscopy technique developed by this group. The series of molecules, prepared by the Wasielewski group, is designed to vary the electronic couplings and charge-transfer character in a systematic way. One set of compounds are caged complexes designed to capture and deliver multiple charges for use in multielectron redox reactions. Another set are bridged dimers of terrylene and perylene diimide, held in specific geometries. The bridged dimer systems have systematically controlled electronic couplings relevant to charge transfer in singlet fission. Two dimensional WL spectroscopy uses continuum generation for the pulse sequence, creating spectra that span nearly the entire visible and near-IR region of the spectrum. White-light is much weaker than the output of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and so the spectrometer is paired to a 100 kHz laser source and a shot-to-shot pulse shaper. With a broad spectral range and high signal-to-noise, this 2D WL spectrometer is well-suited for studying Professor Wasielewski's compounds.  Initial 2D WL spectra contain cross peaks that reveal charge-transfer transitions that were previously unobserved in absorption spectra, uncovering the photophysical pathway for charge transfer in these compounds. The sensitivity of this 100 kHz spectrometer is so high that the final aim of this research is to implement it as a microscopy  tool to measure spatially resolved 2D WL spectra. This research may extend our understanding of charge transfer and to develop new optical technologies.  The experiments made possible by the combination of these tailor-made molecules and new 2D WL spectroscopy may overcome existing challenges and extend the understanding of charge transfer in chemistry."

The carbon-hydrogen single bond (C-H) and carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) are two of the most common chemical bonds in organic compounds and represent convenient locations to introduce new functionality into those compounds. However, it is difficult to achieve a desired reaction at only one specific C-H or C=C bond of the many that are present in a single molecule. In this project, Dr. Schomaker is developing new silver catalysts that transform these bonds to important and useful carbon-nitrogen bonds with high yields, less waste, and with the ability to selectively make many different useful products from a single starting compound.  Studies to understand the unique features of silver that enable such high, predictable levels of control over this reactivity are key to designing improved and durable catalysts that efficiently transform precious hydrocarbon feedstocks into valuable materials, even using water as reaction solvent.  Dr. Schomaker is active in outreach programs related to her research interests in catalysis to educate and engage the general public, especially young women, in fields related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Her activities include developing hands-on experimental modules centered on topics related to silver catalysis for ""Expanding Your Horizons"", a STEM-centered program for girls in 6-8th grades, as well as entertaining and educational demonstrations on silver chemistry for ""Science is Fun"" public presentations.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jennifer Schomaker of the University of Wisconsin is developing low-cost, modular catalysts for the tunable functionalization of C-H bonds to valuable C-N bonds. Such methods are crucial for streamlined syntheses of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, chiral ligands and amine building blocks, but represent a long-standing challenge in the field of catalysis. To address this issue, Dr. Schomaker is pursuing a fundamental understanding of the unique features of silver complexes that enable them to achieve catalyst-controlled transformations of C-H bonds to C-N bonds through metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer processes. A combination of variable temperature (VT) NMR, diffusion spectroscopy, mechanistic and computational studies (density functional theory and higher-level ab initio methods such as CASSCF) are being employed to assess how the features of N-donor ligands influence the electronic structure of the metal nitrene, the dynamic/fluxional behavior of reactive intermediates in solution and promotion of non-covalent interactions between substrate/catalyst to influence the site of the C-H functionalization event. Ultimately, this work is establishing universal design principles for the synthesis of catalysts that facilitate non-directed C-H functionalizations capable of overriding innate reactivity preferences that are extendable to other metals and other C-H oxidation reactions, particularly in an asymmetric context. Dr. Schomaker is also active in a number of STEM outreach programs to engage and educate students in her community about the importance of catalysis in solving challenges that currently face our society. She is particularly interested in increasing the representation of women in STEM disciplines to support the broader impacts of this work."

In collaborations with Dr. John Heinrich of Revolution NMR, LLC, the team is specifically targeting analysis of substances of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, although the target improvements will have wide-ranging impact across the many disciplines that use SSNMR in almost all fields of chemistry.

To expand this impact even further, the Munson/Rossini team is 1) providing short courses for graduate students and postdocs, addressing the basics of solid-state NMR and its applications to pharmaceutical and material science; 2) establishing a visiting scientist program to enable for students, industrial representatives, and members of government agencies to learn the advanced techniques being developed; and 3) reaching out to other disciplines, such as chemical engineering, food science, and agriculture to highlight how new developments in NMR can be used to solve their problems. <br/><br/>Three approaches are being employed to improve the sensitivity, resolution, and general capabilities of SSNMR of crystalline and amorphous organic compounds (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients). 1) Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is known to increase sensitivity by orders of magnitude.  Drs. Munson and Rossini are working to optimize these effects by studying the impact of particle size and phase separation in amorphous solid dispersions. One aim is to establish a means of identifying and differentiating polymorphic forms. 2) A mechanical magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR probe operable at liquid nitrogen temperatures to lower the cost of these kinds of experiments while retaining or enhancing the ability to control the environment in the MAS rotor.  It is anticipated that this will provide about an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity compared to a standard NMR probe operating at 298 K, as well as improved radiofrequency performance. 3) The team is working to improve the resolution of SSNMR spectra by using two-dimensional proton-carbon heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (HETCOR)."

An important feature of this method is the confinement of the Cu catalyst within each hyperbranched polymer molecule, resulting in a chain-growth polymerization mechanism with a linear increase of polymer molecular weight and decreased polydispersity with reaction conversion.  In addition, the dangling B group in the linear unit is expected to demonstrate higher reactivity than those in the terminal unit, resulting in a fast conversion of linear unit to dendritic unit in hyperbranched polymers and ultimately achieving a high degree of branching.  The research activities provide hands-on laboratory training to the graduate and undergraduate students at Notre Dame in organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, and various characterization techniques. The students are developing presentation skills targeting both expert and non-expert audiences. The broader education and outreach impacts are magnified by: 1) improving the impact of current and new polymer chemistry topics in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, 2) lecturing at local high schools to raise the public awareness of advanced polymer materials and nanotechnologies, and 3) organizing an annual Notre Dame Polymer Materials Symposium to stimulate academic-industrial collaborations and engaging the participation of high school students and teachers in a local science fair."

Optical microscopes have a limit as to how far one is able to ""zoom in"" on a sample, as the wavelike nature of light limits the resolution to several hundred nanometers. However, many important structures, such as the surface of living cells, have tremendous variation in chemical composition on much shorter length scales. This nanoscale variation leads to wide range of responses in processes such as pharmaceutical binding and cellular signaling. Professor Frontiera's research entails the development and application of an optical microscopy technique that is capable of examining chemical composition on a nanometer length scale.

The educational component of this work is to have students lead the creation of tutorials that are expected to illustrate advanced concepts in spectroscopy and microscopy, to the public.  These techniques are increasingly used in fields as diverse as health care, food safety, machining, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are soluble, nanometer-scale particles composed of semiconductor materials. QDs can have bright and size-tunable fluorescence, and have current applications in flat-panel displays and in bio-imaging. QDs are also of interest for solution-processable solar cells that can be scaled sustainably to meet worldwide energy needs. However, the performance of QD solar cells remains far below the theoretical limit.  There is considerable variability in fluorescence performance among QD samples of similar size and composition, due to structural differences at the QD surface. It is important to connect emerging analytical methods and theoretical models to the design of stable QDs with desirable surface properties. This project takes a new approach to developing a fundamental understanding of QD structure and chemistry by measuring the heat that is emitted or absorbed when chemical transformations of QDs take place. The ITC approach is expected to be broadly applicable to semiconductor nanocrystal science.  The technique is being used here to advance knowledge that could lead to improved QD solar cell performance. Dr. Greytak's research program at the University of South Carolina engages students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. He has demonstrated nationally-recognized leadership in chemistry education.  He also serves as the head judge for chemistry at the South Carolina Midlands Regional Science Fair for high school students.<br/><br/>Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) are complex assemblies of a crystalline core and an interfacial layer that, given time, may exchange matter with the solution and other NCs. It is highly advantageous to have a set of metrics that allows different NC samples to be profiled, both so that they can be characterized with sufficient precision to predict synthetic and physical behaviors.  It is also adventitious to have a sufficiently rich experimental description of the system to constrain models that begin to capture the complexity of NC-ligand and ligand-ligand interactions. In this program, Dr. Greytak is being supported to measure equilibrium constants, enthalpies, equivalencies, and interaction terms associated with representative ligand exchange and ion exchange reactions at NC quantum dot (QD) surfaces in anhydrous solvents. Purification techniques such as gel permeation chromatography are used to provide QDs in a well-defined initial state. The knowledge acquired from these types of measurements represents a fundamental advance in QD chemistry that hastens the discovery of higher-performing and more sophisticated QD assemblies and solution structures. In particular, the performance and material scope of QD-based photovoltaics can be expanded through improved understanding of ligand exchange and ion exchange reactions. This project also provides research training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, who are building expertise in nanocrystal preparative chemistry, calorimetry, and other analytical techniques that are necessary to advance the field of nanoscience into practical technologies.

Hartwig in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. In this program, Professor Hartwig is developing a mechanistic understanding of catalytic reactions that use transition metal complexes bonded to fluorine-containing alkyl groups. These studies answer a series of questions about the impact of fluorine atoms on the metal-bound carbon atom.  The studies also assess several approaches to control the reactivity of these fluoroalkyl complexes of transition metals. By developing methods to control the reactivity of fluoroalkyl complexes, this research enables the development of new catalytic reactions that add fluoroalkyl groups into organic molecules. Organic molecules containing fluorine are vital to materials, agricultural, and medicinal sciences. For example, over 20% of new pharmaceuticals and 25% of licensed herbicides contain fluorine. The project is well suited for providing a broad education to Ph.D. scientists and undergraduates, including those of underrepresented groups. A series of outreach activities for K-12 students, the general public, and the general scientific community are part of Professor Hartwig's efforts resulting from the research program.<br/><br/>Although a large fraction of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals contain fluorine, fluorinated structures are largely limited to those derived from simple fluoroarenes, trifluoromethylarenes or trifluoroacetates. Many of the potential methods to synthesize more diverse structures containing fluoroalkyl groups require new approaches to induce and control the reactivity of fluoroalkyl transition-metal complexes in catalytic reactions. This research creates these capabilities by demonstrating, by a combination of kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions and synthesis of catalytic intermediates, how to induce productive reactivity in fluoroalkyl complexes of palladium.  This project also creates new catalytic reactions that couple partially fluorinated alkyl groups to aromatic and heteroaromatic molecules to form products that are difficult to access by current synthetic methods. With this information, fluoroalkylation reactions that are currently stoichiometric are being made catalytic.  Additionally, new reactions of aryl halides that form fluoroalkylarenes with novel structures that are difficult to prepare by alternative methods are being created. This research enables the preparation of new classes of fluorinated molecules for materials science, medicinal chemistry, and agroscience. As part of the educational plan, Professor Hartwig teaches short-courses for those lacking formal training in organometallic catalysis, co-authors a sophomore organic text that includes content on catalysis in medicinal and green organic chemistry, and delivers lectures to general audiences, predominantly in forums in which he reaches potential scientists from underrepresented groups."

They also control molecular recognition events in the body. This research develops versatile methods for the synthesis of bioactive glycosides and glycopeptides.  This research enables comprehensive studies on the function of carbohydrates in biology, and facilitates the preparation of high-value biological compounds and pharmaceutical agents.

A majority of known methods to synthesize saccharides focus on substrates in which the anomeric position is substituted with an electronegative element. This approach bears several limitations such as substrate dependence, the need for protective group manipulations, and incompatibility with free alcohol groups. The central hypothesis of this NSF CAREER award is that configurationally stable anomeric nucleophiles are engaged in stereospecific (stereoretentive) reactions under transition metal-catalyzed conditions,  forming carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds with high selectivities.  These moieties are independent from the nature of the substrates and catalysts. Capitalizing on these new conceptual foundations, three specific aims are pursued: (a) the development of cross-coupling reactions of anomeric boronic acids, (b) the implementation of new chemical methods for the synthesis of carbon-glycosides, and (c) the development of new methods in the synthesis of nitrogen-linked glycoproteins. Successful realization of these aims yields novel umpolung methods that eliminate the critical problems inherent to the previous approaches. The synthetic approaches also enable the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs, anti-tumor antibiotics, glycoproteins, and glycopeptides under standardized and user-friendly conditions. The research program is also intimately connected with ongoing educational and outreach activities. An undergraduate course featuring blended learning supplemented by randomized trial to improve undergraduate pedagogy is being developed and implemented.

This work illuminates the mechanisms by which specific and unique properties of a colloidal QD sensitizer enhance the performance of a molecular catalyst with known specificity for CO2 reduction, by addressing several fundamental challenges associated with this task, namely: (i) synthesis and surface functionalization of a QD sensitizer with enough reducing power to donate multiple electrons to the co-catalyst; (ii) control of the local concentration of hydrogen ions; (iii) fast hole extraction from the sensitizer to inhibit recombination and photo-oxidative degradation; and (iv) maximal electronic coupling between the sensitizer and the co-catalyst to provide pathways for fast electron delivery. One and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electron microscopy, electrochemical measurements and steady-state and time resolved optical measurements allow for quantitative characterization of the binding affinity for the QD-catalyst pair, the proton (H+) concentration on the QD surface, the degree of adsorption of the catalytic substrates and intermediates, the rate constants for elementary electron and hole transfer steps, and the efficacy of hole scavenging. These techniques complement the gas and liquid chromatography, NMR, and infrared spectroscopy characterization of product distributions and reaction rates.

The helical and double helical oligothiophene-based radicals are intriguing novel molecules with a combination of chiral pi-systems and paramagnetism. Paramagnetism associated with helical or double helical pi-system may render unique properties due to the combination of chirality and delocalized electronic spin, providing an avenue for development of novel paramagnetic materials with inherently strong chiral properties that could facilitate discovery of new organic magneto-optic materials and devices. The proposed radicals are being prepared by modern organic synthetic methodologies and characterized by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, as well as computations."

Assigning individual functions to the various proteins is a challenging endeavor, especially since a protein may be active or inactive depending on the status of the cell. This status of a protein is often controlled by a group of enzymes known as proteases. The human genome has the capacity to produce about 550 proteases. How, why, and where these proteases function in the complex cellular environment remains poorly understood.  This project involves examining two closely-related proteases of the cysteine cathepsin family of enzymes; cathepsin B and L. Selective probes are made to target these cathepsins so that their function can be understood.  This research endeavor provides educational opportunities with hands-on research experience to graduate and undergraduate students. The laboratory environment is structured for an enhanced interdisciplinary experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, there are outreach activities incorporating research training for students from Queensborough Community College and Bard High School Early College in New York. Special emphasis is given to include students from underrepresented groups in science disciplines, women, and veterans. <br/><br/>Human cysteine cathepsins comprise a small group of eleven enzymes that are important in maintaining cell homeostasis, growth, differentiation, and survival. One of the main challenges of cathepsin biology is in assigning specific function to individual enzymes in a given cellular context. This is mainly because several functional redundancies and overlapping substrate specificities have been shown to exist in individual cell types. Since newly synthesized cellular cathepsins are subject to post-translational modifications, thereby leading to alteration of their activities (and hence function), specific investigative tools are needed for activity-based interrogation of cellular function in live cells. This project is developing selective tagless activity-based probes (TABPs) of two closely related cysteine cathepsins; cathepsin L and B. The developed TABPs are used in differential and quantitative mapping of cathepsin B and L activities in live pancreatic and neuronal cells. The knowledge gained from these studies significantly advances the functional understanding of cellular processes involving human cathepsin B and L."

The ability of nature to control the types of molecules that pass through the membrane is central to biological function.  Nature accomplishes this task by embedding proteins with complex chemical structures into the membrane.  These proteins form small channels that allow specific molecules through, but reject others.  While the importance of natural channels in biology is well-appreciated, the design of artificial channels that exhibit the same functionality as their biological analogs is immensely challenging.  In this research project, Professor George Gokel at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis is studying the transport capabilities of relatively simple molecules inserted into lipid membranes.  The ability to create artificial membrane channels that mediate the passage of specific molecules could impact applications ranging from biology and medicine to water purification, problems with significant societal importance.  In addition, this project is providing scientific training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary science. <br/><br/>Controlling insertion into a membrane, manipulating the selectivity and direction of ion and molecule transport, and understanding the organization of the membrane around the channels, present major challenges in supramolecular chemistry.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, the Gokel Lab develops a variety of novel structures that penetrate lipid bilayers and selectively transport cations and molecules through the membranes.  This research enhances understanding of membrane penetrating compounds by using a plethora of techniques to interrogate their properties and functional mechanisms.  The long-term goal is to establish fundamental principles for designing synthetic structures that can substitute complex proteins in mediating the passage of specific molecules into specific types of cells."

Professor Birman is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Washington University in Saint Louis.  Prof. Birman's research interests revolve around chiral organic compounds: compounds whose structures exist as distinct mirror images called enantiomers. The two enantiomers of the same compound often display different biological activities, which becomes vitally important in the case of chiral pharmaceuticals.  The wrong enantiomer of a drug may have reduced pharmacological activity or even be toxic. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing methods for preparing chiral compounds in the form of single enantiomers. Selective catalysis, which is the main focus of research in the Birman group, is an economical and waste-free approach to accomplishing this goal. The present project aims to explore a new family of reactions using Birman's chiral catalysts, which previously were developed in the Birman group and are currently used by many researchers worldwide. These reactions provide access to new classes of chiral compounds that may find applications as drug development and biological studies. Prof. Birman's research program, which encompasses many areas of synthetic organic chemistry, is suited for educating students at all levels: graduate students involved in research, undergraduates receiving training in the Birman lab, and those students taking Advanced Organic Lab under his supervision.  In addition, Professor Birman's outreach activities in the public schools of Saint Louis are designed to spark the interest of elementary school students in science. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of the proposed project is the Lewis base-catalyzed enantioselective activation of thioesters. Specifically, the Birman group is developing an asymmetric catalytic rearrangement of alpha,beta-unsaturated thioesters into zwitterionic enolates, followed by a formal cycloaddition with pi-electrophiles. The resulting polycyclic structures, adorned with several stereocenters, are expected to be important in natural product synthesis and medicinal chemistry. These polycyclic products are difficult to access by other synthetic methods. In addition, the enantioselective alcoholysis of racemic thioesters is being explored, both in static and dynamic kinetic resolution mode.  Amidine-based enantioselective acylation catalysts previously developed in the Birman laboratory are employed to achieve both of these new transformations. The educational plan associated with this research program includes further development of the organic chemistry component of the undergraduate curriculum at Washington University and continued outreach to elementary/middle school students in the public schools of Saint Louis."

Liquid crystal displays are widely used - one example is in digital watch faces.

Despite the technological importance of transition metals, theoretical methods to calculate their properties are much less developed than for organic molecules, where high-accuracy calculations can be performed that rival the accuracy of experiments. This shortcoming can be traced to the intricate interplay between correlated electronic motion and the impacts of relativity, both of which are much more important for transition metals than for organic molecules.

Predictive, accurate calculations on transition metal systems using these methods can direct experimental efforts in designing efficient and cheap biomimetic catalysts as well help design the next generation of systems for quantum computing.

By measuring the absorption of light (especially infrared light) as the film thickness is systematically varied, chemical and structural information about the molecules nearest the surface can be deduced. The information and insights gained from this research have impacts in other fields of chemistry research, as well as applied technologies such as catalysis, corrosion, lubrication, and semiconductor processing. This research project is also serving as a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in physical chemistry, laser technology, and computational science. Outreach activities include Professor Shaw's Rural Scholars Program, which engages aspiring undergraduate students from rural areas in genuine laboratory research experiences.<br/><br/><br/>The experimental strategy employed in the Shaw laboratory is developed around the dynamic wetting (DW) technique, which creates molecular fluids films with controlled thicknesses from about one monolayer to nearly 10 microns thickness. This approach circumvents difficulties in direct observation of the interface by selectively excluding opaque, bulk phases, and allows detailed descriptions of interface formation and behaviors. The net molecular orientation and the absolute thickness of the fluid films are extracted by sum-frequency generation (SFG), infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) with polarization modulation (PM-IRRAS), Raman spectroscopy, and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The experimental spectra are used to benchmark and validate computational and fluid dynamic models of interfacial molecular structure. Ultimately, this research may lead to an understanding of the roles of intermolecular forces and geometric confinement in creating chemical interfaces at defined distances from surfaces, advancing fundamental research in lubrication, tribology, and heterogeneous catalysis."

Professor Monti's research group uses several experimental techniques in this investigation, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which can image individual atoms and molecules, and photoelectron spectroscopy, which uses intense laser light to eject electrons from the sample, and reveals how strongly electrons are bound to either the molecule or the surface.

Professor Monti combines atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy with momentum- and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of interfaces with systematically varied molecular and surface electronic structure to enable predictive tailoring of charge flow across interfaces. Charge-transfer across interfaces constitutes a central process in heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry and novel organic electronic technologies.

They are supported to develop a conceptual framework and computational methodologies to address energy conversion processes on the nano scale. Energy conversion - the change from one form of available energy to another, has always been an important subject for fundamental research as well as technological applications.  Scientists and engineers strive to increase the efficiency of converting energy to useful forms on one hand, and to limit its escape as wasted forms on the other. As science and technology enter the nano age, such problems re-emerge in new forms that require new conceptual frameworks and new experimental and computational approaches for their description.  Nitzan and his coworkers focus on several central issues within this effort:  The description of heat transfer on the molecular scale and the coupling between charge and heat transport in molecular systems.  They are constructing a      quantum thermodynamics framework to address such processes, their inter-relationships and their efficiencies.  The research impacts a diverse range of applications of nanoscience -- from dissipation and information loss in quantum computing to the efficiency of operation of nano-photo-devices as well as biological electron-transfer processes.  The Nitzan group provides research opportunities for students at all levels: high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral.<br/><br/><br/> This project addresses three major problems:  1) electron transfer across thermal gradients.   Although coupling between electron and energy transfer in metals is known to exist, it is usually disregarded in models of electron hopping in molecular systems and often overlooked even in semiconductors. The objective is to study the interplay between electron and heat transport in such systems, to propose ways for their experimental observation, and to examine their implications for nanoscale energy conversion devices.  2) heat transfer on the molecular scale, where the connection between structural and dynamical properties of molecules and their ability to conduct, utilize and dissipate heat is being examined.    Here the proposed investigation contacts the growing number of experimental groups working in this area as well as with other computational investigations.   3) Finally, this project continues work in the Nitzan group aimed at developing a general framework for the description of such process within a quantum generalization of thermodynamics of small systems. This work aims to achieve the equivalent of what classical thermodynamics does on the macroscopic scale: to provide concepts, theoretical structure and computational methodologies for addressing processes underlying energy conversion, dissipation and utilization that occur on the molecular scale where quantum mechanics is strongly manifested. The processes studied in the first two parts of the project will be formulated in this language as special cases of what should become a quantum thermodynamics theory of nanoscale systems that strongly interact with their environment."

Professor Wang and his students develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies for organic synthesis based on the concept of aminocatalysis.  The goal of this research is to develop and exploit new organocatalytic activation modes for organic transformations.  New chemistries are transformed into powerful synthetic methods for the facile and atom-economic synthesis of versatile building blocks starting from simple and readily available chemicals.  The syntheses are also conducted under mild reaction conditions.  These ""one-pot"" cascade methods, used to make complex molecular architectures, address critical challenges in modern organic synthesis. The methods include the improvement of synthetic efficiency, the use of sustainable and inexpensive chemicals, the avoidance of toxic agents, and the reduction of waste and hazardous byproducts.  As a consequence of operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions and environmental friendliness, this research is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Wang's group is well positioned to provide education and training for students from groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This project continues efforts aimed at expanding the scope of aminocatalysis beyond the well-established activation modes of enamine and iminium catalysis.  Professor Wang and his team challenge mechanistic dogma by showing that amine moieties in adducts which result from nucleophilic additions to iminum ions can serve as leaving groups in ensuing nucleophilic substitution reactions. In situ release of the intermediate amine addition products creates a new scenario for aminocatalytic direct functionalization of aldehydes.  This research demonstrates that through careful manipulation of the electronic and steric properties of catalysts and reactants, judicious design and selection of amine catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions, new and powerful catalytic cascade reactions are developed. Given the ready accessibility, reactivity and broad structural diversity of aldehydes, a wide array of new synthetic building blocks and biologically-important complex molecular architectures are constructed in efficient one-pot reactions.  The educational plan continues a tradition to recruit undergraduate students especially from underrepresented minority groups over the summer to conduct research in Dr. Wang's laboratory.

Radical polymerization is a powerful synthetic method. It is used to make nearly half of all polymers (plastics), about 100 million tons worldwide each year. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is a special type of radical polymerization that can prepare polymers with precisely controlled chain lengths. In addition, depending on the chemical structure of the monomer, it can produce a variety of shapes, such as stars, combs, brushes or rings and each of these has specialty applications. While ATRP is a common technique, some monomers, especially those with acidic functionalities, are difficult to polymerize using ATRP. Polymers formed from acidic monomers are desirable because they have unique properties that make them useful in a variety of applications. With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matyjaszewski at Carnegie Mellon University is developing ATRP methods for the controlled polymerization of acidic monomers. The project, which could enable the creation of new commercially-scaled plastics that benefit society, trains undergraduate and graduate students in polymer science. The research team also works with members of the Controlled Radical Polymerization (CRP) Consortium at Carnegie Mellon University to develop new materials for use in a range of industrial markets. <br/><br/>The intellectual challenge of this research comprises understanding, improving, and expanding direct ATRP of acidic monomers without neutralization or protection. Controlled ATRP of acidic monomers requires a fundamental understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of ATRP and the associated side reactions. New copper catalyst complexes are developed to achieve higher selectivity and stability under acidic conditions. Iron catalysts and metal-free organic photoredox catalysts are studied to further reduce an environmental impact of ATRP. New synthetic pathways are explored to economically produce acidic polymers by direct ATRP of unprotected monomers. The new polymers with well-controlled complex architectures, including organic-inorganic hybrids such as nanocomposites, functionalized surfaces, and  bioconjugates are of both academic and commercial importance. The process saves time and energy and reduces cost in academic and industrial laboratories. The results of this research are disseminated through Professor Matyjaszewski's website, timely publications, student presentations at (inter)national conferences, and through the industrial CRP Consortium at Carnegie Mellon University."

Catalysts are substances that cause a chemical reaction to occur and are required in many important laboratory and industrial processes. Since catalysts are often based on rare, expensive metals, the discovery of replacements that contain common, inexpensive metals is important. In this respect, aluminum is among the most abundant and least expensive of the elements. Consequently, it is an attractive candidate for use in catalysis. However, effective catalysts often must be able to easily gain and/or lose electrons and aluminum normally cannot do this. In this project, the problem is circumvented by attaching aluminum to groups that are capable of gaining and/or losing electrons. This results in aluminum based systems that can be developed as catalysts for the conversion of olefins (components in petroleum and natural gas) into high value chemicals. In addition, this project provides research opportunities for undergraduate students, which prepares them to enter the workforce or continue their development in graduate or professional schools. On top of this, the students participate in the Philadelphia Science Festival, and outreach to local and elementary schools with large populations of African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students.<br/><br/><br/>In this project aluminum is coordinated to a series of multi-dentate nitroxide-based ligands and the structure and bonding of the resulting complexes is studied. By incorporating multiple N-O moieties into a multi dentate framework robust complexes that exist over a range of ligand oxidation states are obtained. Through variations in ligand substituents the steric and electronic properties of the complexes are modulated and their ability to activate small molecules is evaluated. This knowledge is used to guide the development of aluminum-nitroxide complexes as catalysts for the anti-Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of alkenes.

The aim of this research is to utilize controlled polycondensation methods to polymerize highly functional aromatic building blocks. Precision synthesis incorporating these units into polymers will require advances in metal-ligand design, an understanding of how metals interact with the growing polymer chain and, insight into how different functional groups (i.e., ketones, esters, amides) can alter the chain-growth reaction.

Such functionality encompasses cofactor design and synthesis, advanced computational methods, protein expression and characterization and state-of-the-art pump-probe transient optical methods. The computational methods allow the design of proteins that bind co-factors in a precisely organized spatial arrangement. State-of-the-art, pump-probe, transient optical methods characterize function and reaction dynamics.

Computer simulations provide powerful insight for addressing technological challenges and for guiding the design of novel materials with desired properties.  While simulations with atomically detailed models are often very accurate, they do not provide the necessary efficiency for addressing the long length and time scales that are relevant for materials design.  In contrast, lower resolution coarse-grained models provide superior efficiency, but currently provide limited accuracy and often require extensive parameterization for each new system and environment.  Professor Noid and his coworkers develop theoretical methods for improving the accuracy of coarse-grained models, as well as for extending their range of applicability. Additionally, Professor Noid organizes an intergenerational science club that promotes life-long scientific education within the broader community, while integrating students of all ages into the scientific enterprise.  <br/><br/>This project develops and validates a van der Waals (vdW) approach for improving both the transferability and also the thermodynamic properties of bottom-up multiscale methods.  Motivated by an exact decomposition of the many-body potential of mean force, which is the correct potential for a coarse-grained (CG) model.  This model perfectly reproduces both the structural and thermodynamic properties of an underlying atomistic model.  The vdW approach: (1) adopts leading variational methods to determine effective potentials that accurately describe structural properties and (2) develops new variational methods to accurately model thermodynamic properties.  In particular, the work extends a pressure-matching variational principle for modeling density fluctuations in inhomogeneous and interfacial systems.  The comparison of potentials obtained from different variational approaches provides insight into their entropic components and allow for predictive estimates of their transferability. Ultimately, this work may develop predictive CG models for exceedingly accurate and efficient simulation studies of mesoscale self-assembly at aqueous interfaces and conduction in polymer-based batteries."

The SWAMP effect could provide an inexpensive, portable, and continuously generated source of ""hyper-magnetized"" water needed for some types of MRI, offering an alternative to the expensive, high-maintenance approaches normally used.

Thus, essentially all atoms in a 2D material are located at the surface and interact with their environment. This ability to form reactive surfaces makes 2D materials interesting for promoting chemical reactions, such as those driven by electricity or light, processes known as electro- or photocatalysis, respectively. In perfect 2D materials, the lack of broken bonds at the surface of the single molecular layers often makes them quite chemically inert. Useful chemical functionalities arise from crystal imperfections that are challenging to create in a reliable and controlled manner. In this project, Professor Matthias Batzill and his group at the University of South Florida are designing 2D materials with atomic-scale crystal modifications. The researchers then correlate the structural and electronic properties of the 2D materials with their chemical functionalities. Their research may lead to novel concepts for making novel or improved multicomponent 2D materials for electrocatalysis. The research in this project is strongly interdisciplinary and teaches students chemistry concepts that prepare them for jobs in industry or academia. Moreover, this project strengthens international collaborations and encourages students to gain international research experience by fostering student exchanges with collaborating institutions abroad.  Students will collaborate with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) as well as at Elettra and Soleil synchrotrons in Italy and France, respectively. <br/> <br/>With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, multi-component and nanostructured transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are investigated to determine fundamental principles for the creation of catalytically active sites in these materials.

Regulating growth conditions in MBE enables control over edge density, composition, and phase boundaries, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic defects. The structure, defects, and interfaces are characterized with atomic resolution by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Photoemission gives additional insight into electronic states and band alignments that promote charge transfer processes.

The DOF-MS technique measures the distance each ion travels over a specified flight period to determine the ion mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). It offers many potential advantages, such as the determination of m/z for ions of very high mass, increased speed of measurement, improved dynamic range, adjustable and improved measurement resolution, and the subsequent collection of ions for follow-on analysis by other techniques.

This DOF/TOF strategy may have the potential to significantly improve chromatographic MS detection with extremely wide dynamic range, fast temporal response, and wide coverage.  Specifically, Drs. Ray and Hieftje couple the spatial segregation of DOF-MS to a novel type of charge-sensitive ion detector array known as a focal-plane camera (FPC) to simultaneously measure the ion currents observed at every spatially discrete detector element, thus detecting the m/z and abundance for each desired mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) with very wide dynamic range and excellent temporal registry.  In addition, Dr. Ray and his collaborators are developing a Zoom-TOF-MS approach that uses the ion focusing strategies of DOF-MS with a TOF-MS setup to improve the mass resolving power of the instrument while requiring only minor functional and architectural changes.

However, decomposition of catalytic intermediates and low selectivity in cross metathesis are two fundamental problems that limit the efficiency and scope of these powerful reactions. In this collaborative project, a research team led by Drs. Diver and Keister are developing the Buchner reaction to trap reactive intermediates and thus study of mechanism of these reactions. Key questions center on the decomposition pathways and reactivity of ruthenium vinyl carbenes. The reactivity of substituted vinyl carbenes has not been evaluated previously, despite the importance of these intermediates in the ene-yne pathway. Quenching of metathesis reactions continues to be a problem and reliable, rapid methods for quenching a wide variety of ruthenium catalysts is an important goal of the project. Solid-supported isocyanides are being developed and used for the quenching and removal of ruthenium carbenes. Dr. Diver presents a molecular science course for non-majors at SUNY Buffalo that increases general scientific literacy of the University students."

Professors Billiot and Billiot of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, Kevin Morris of Carthage College, and Yayin Fang of Howard University form a multi-institutional collaboration. The work focuses on the investigation and elucidation of the factors responsible for molecular self-assembly, and how these factors affect the ability of the self-assembled molecular structures to interact and recognize other molecules of biological importance. A variety of experimental and computational methods are used to developed Quantitative Structure Enantioselective Retention Relationships (QSERR). QSERR is then used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different chiral selectors for capillary electrophoretic separations. Two of the three institutions are primarily undergraduate institutions that currently do not have a master's program in chemistry. Thus, the research will be conducted at these two schools exclusively by undergraduate students. One of these is also a Hispanic Serving Institution. The third university involved in the research is an HBCU. The research serves as a tool for the PIs to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds and to encourage these students to pursue post baccalaureate degrees in science.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is part of an ongoing, long-term multi-faceted study focusing on investigating and elucidating the factors responsible for (a) self-assembly, (b) function, (c) higher ordered structure and (d) molecular recognition of amino acid based macromolecular assemblies (AABMAs). In particular, the research will focus on examining the effects that pH, ionic strength, surfactant concentration, and type of counter-ion have on the factors mentioned above. These AABMAs are being utilized in this study as chiral pseudostationary phases in capillary electrophoresis. Thus, the major focus of these studies is to gain insights into the factors responsible for chiral recognition with this class of chiral selector. A deeper understanding of these factors will lead to enhanced chiral separations and improved pseudostationary phases. Understanding such interactions is not only important in the development of chiral recognition media but also in the optimization of the separation conditions. In addition, since enantiorecognition of the systems under study are amino acids, the knowledge gained from these studies will be potentially transferable to other amino acid based systems such as proteins."

Respiration, photosynthesis, batteries, electronic devices and many other intricate components of lives heavily rely on efficient charge-transfer processes. Concurrently, electric dipoles are everywhere, and the localized fields around them can have a profound effect on how charges move.  Therefore, it is important to understand how dipoles affect charge transfer, in order to enhance desired forward electron transduction while suppressing undesired processes.

This process accounts for a significant fraction of aerosol particles in the atmosphere.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to identification and characterization biological and environmental samples.  To enable application to complex samples, MS is usually preceded by a separation step, typically employing solution-based methods of liquid chromatography or electrophoresis.  These methods are increasingly being replaced or complemented by much faster separations based on gas-phase ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), which can provide additional insight into elements of ion structure.  Dr. Shvartsburg and his group are advancing the capabilities of IMS based on fundamentally new measurement concepts.  The research is integrated with an educational program centered on an IMS exhibit in the Wichita Exploration Place and other science museums and discovery centers nationwide, and taken to schools as part of a K-12 outreach program.  The exhibit emulates IMS separations demonstrating the key aspects of resolution and sensitivity in an interactive format.  This effort is complemented by a summer program for faculty from undergraduate institutions and community colleges in Kansas, providing them with opportunities to learn more about MS, IMS, and their applications.  Incorporation of this knowledge into courses taught at their home institutions may help prepare students to contribute to a technology-based economy.<br/><br/>Initial IMS methods were designed such that measured ion velocities are linearly proportional to the applied electric field.  The relationship between field strength and velocity becomes more complex in strong fields, where ion mobility varies with field strength, enabling a newer technique called field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS) that sorts ions by the difference between mobilities at high and low fields.  FAIMS is capable of providing exceptionally fine separations, extending, in favorable cases, to separations of isotopic isomers (isotopomers).  Dr. Shvartsburg is pursuing multiple approaches to advancing the resolving power of FAIMS by expanding the nonlinear IMS paradigm in fundamentally novel ways.  One approach is higher-order differential IMS employing more complex asymmetric waveforms to achieve unique separations.  Another is IMS with alignment of dipole direction, where the pendular locking of macromolecular dipoles permits capturing the directionally (rather than orientationally) averaged cross sections for more detailed structural characterization.  Implementation of FAIMS at reduced temperatures may extend the pendular regime to smaller ions (including essentially all peptides) and avoid heating ions above room temperature, which can cause dissociation or structural distortion in high-field IMS systems.  Assembly of multidimensional separations comprising linear and nonlinear IMS stages is central to this work.  By devising and sharing teaching tools related to these sophisticated concepts, Dr. Shvartsburg is not only advancing our characterization capabilities, but also helping prepare students with the skills and understanding needed to advance the state of technology."

This award is cofunded by the CISE/ACI Software Reuse Venture Fund.   In the science of materials, ordered arrays of molecules forming structures known as molecular crystals play an essential role in the pharmaceutical, electronics, and defense industries. Often, the crucial question is which crystals should be made for a particular application.   It is worth noting that one of the most widely used pharmaceutical molecular crystals, aspirin, was discovered essentially by accident. Typically, in crystal engineering, it is necessary to screen large databases of potential candidate compounds. Unfortunately, making and characterizing molecular crystals in the laboratory is generally time consuming and costly, rendering a trial-and-error approach through such a database impractical. How many more important molecular crystal systems might be discovered if a systematic, targeted approach could be applied? Theory and computation, which can, in principle, rapidly predict molecular crystal structures and their properties, are uniquely poised to play a key role in creating such a targeted approach. What is needed, however, are robust algorithms for making these predictions.  The Tuckerman group develops computational techniques and software for predicting the crystal structures a given compound can form and ranking them according to a thermodynamic property known as free energy, which has been recognized in the scientific community as the proper figure of merit for such a ranking but has remained an elusive property to determine. The Tuckerman group also adapts these algorithms for studying the conformational preferences of short chains of amino acids known as oligopeptides in order to explore the role these important biological molecules play in immunogenicity and the design of new classes of pharmaceuticals.  Tuckerman and his coworkers are engaged in many software activities including developing a computer package for crystal structure prediction, improving the efficiency of their molecular dynamics software, PINY-MD and continuing to contribute software to many community software codes.  All of the software developed in this project is made available to the broader research community. <br/><br/>The basic properties of molecular materials in the solid state are often strongly influenced by the details of their crystal structures and the existence of polymorphs.  Experimental determination of these structures is costly and time-consuming, which places increased importance on the role of theory and computation.  Similarly, the biochemical function of small oligopeptides, from immunogenicity to inhibition, is affected by their equilibrium conformations in different environments.  Computational prediction of structure in complex systems such as these is challenging due to the so-called rare-event sampling problem on a rough potential energy landscape, which arises when attempting to study the equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics of many complex systems. Roughness on an energy surface refers to the existence of high barriers to conformational and structural changes.  The Tuckerman group has proposed to develop robust free-energy based enhanced sampling algorithms and software for overcoming the rare-event problem that arises in the crystal structure prediction and conformational sampling of oligopeptides, thereby allowing favored structures to be identified and thermodynamically ranked in an efficient manner. In the proposed methods, the free energy landscape is expressed in terms of select set of collective variables (CVs) designed to distinguish the different structural motifs in these systems. The CVs are first be subject to new surface navigation techniques in order to identify the minima and saddles points, collectively referred to as ""landmarks"" on the landscape, and then targeted for enhanced sampling in order to produce the free energy ranking of the landmarks. The new techniques are applied to predict the crystal structures and polymorphs of both rigid and flexible small organic molecules, to study the conformational free energy landscape of an immunogenic peptide binding to the major histocompatibility complex, and to understand the influence of mechanical force on the unfolding mechanism of -hairpin peptide. Software creation will be accelerated via hackathons organized by the Tuckerman group.  Education of students in rare-event methods is aided through workshops organized at New York University's global campus sites.   Finally, the Tuckerman group reaches out to underrepresented groups via national organizations having a presence in New York City in order to help devise and participate in STEM-related educational activities."

The molecules are designed to have anchoring groups, such as mercapto and isocyano, capable of self assembly on surfaces without affecting the azulenic scaffold's aromaticity.  DFT calculations are used to inform the design of the azulenic molecules.  The products are characterized and tested as potential components in nanoelectronic devices.  The specific aims are: (1) to design asymmetrically anchored organic linkers that feature key structural rigidity and spatial separation of the bridge's frontier molecular orbitals; (2) to evaluate the conductivity/rectification profiles and the electron transfer dynamics in azulene self-assembled monolayers; and (3) to construct molecular electron reservoirs composed of azulene-based organometallic nanocomplexes with at least 12-electron reversible organic redox capacity, and to examine their charge delocalization potential, including organic intervalence coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it is important to understand how these variables affect the timescales of the important motions involved in the chemistry. This knowledge also provides insight into the molecular-level motions that determine the timescale.

Catalysis plays a vital role in many industrial applications. Manufacturing valuable products such as pharmaceuticals, plastics, agrochemicals, and clean fuels often requires properly designed catalysts. Traditional catalysts are highly effective in promoting a wide range of chemical reactions. However, it remains a daunting task to make catalysts that emulate the remarkable performance of enzymes, which are Nature's catalysts. The challenge arises largely from the difficulty of constructing molecules that resemble the complexity of enzymes. In this project, Dr. Zhenqiang Wang of the University of South Dakota is applying several biology-inspired principles to synthesize new classes of molecules that mimic enzymes. This research is integrated with educational outreach programs targeting Native American students to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. These programs are engaging local tribal college students through tribal student-faculty research teams hosted in Dr. Wang's laboratory and through chemistry workshops at regional tribal colleges. The outreach also includes onsite hosting of students from local primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and ""at-home"" support for student-faculty research teams at their home institutions.<br/><br/>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, the team led by Dr. Wang at the University of South Dakota is utilizing a unique class of synthetic receptors, known as metal-organic supercontainers (MOSCs), to investigate new concepts of catalysis. The MOSC-based supramolecular catalysts are structurally unique in that they are constructed from container-molecule precursors (i.e., sulfonylcalixarenes) and feature multiple nano-cavities that serve as substrate binding sites. The MOSC catalysts also feature functionally versatile metal-bound H2O species, which may promote hydrogen-bond, Bronsted-acid, Bronsted-base, and cascade catalysis. Two key strategies, namely, multifunctional nano-cavities and electrostatic regulation, are used to promote the catalytic efficacy, enhance reaction selectivity, and regulate supramolecular reactivity. The unique structural characteristics of the MOSCs, including their compositional versatility, structural modularity, and multi-pore architecture, distinguish them from other synthetic receptor molecules and provide unprecedented opportunities for functionalizing catalytic active sites and engineering supramolecular reactivity. The strategy to modulate supramolecular catalysis using ionic species as electrostatic regulators, which are catalytically inert on their own, is conceptually distinct from conventional methods that rely on encapsulating catalytically active species. The concept of electrostatic regulation is not yet fully recognized by chemists, but has the potential to not only significantly expand the scope of accessible reactions, but fundamentally transform how supramolecular catalysis can be designed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Vasiliou and her students are working to understand the decomposition of carbon compounds containing sulfur when heated.  Sulfur-containing contaminants are often present in fuel sources such as coal, petroleum and biomass.  It is important to remove the sulfur from potential fuel sources to reduce the formation of corrosive acid rain.  Dr. Vasiliou investigate the use of heat to break the chemical bonds of larger molecules into smaller more volatile species and removal of sulfur.  The high-temperature chemistry of sulfur compounds in petroleum and biofuels is poorly understood.  This knowledge gap hinders progress in the development of refinery clean-up processes. This project studies the high-temperature reactions of eight important sulfur-containing molecules.  The research is conducted at a predominantly undergraduate institution, Middlebury College, with only undergraduate students as collaborators.  This type of research experience encourages undergraduates to pursue careers in science.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the unimolecular decomposition of eight petroleum and biomass relevant molecules: dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, ethanethiol, tert-butylthiol, methylthiophene, 3-ethylthiophene and cysteine. This research is the first to establish direct evidence for radical intermediates formed during thermal decomposition. The reaction studies are conducted using a hyperthermal nozzle configured to facilitate matrix isolation infrared absorption and vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopies. These techniques allow for thermal tuneablity (298-1700 K) and sensitive detection of intermediate species such as radicals. In addition to experimental studies, the thermal decomposition mechanisms of the eight sulfur species are investigated theoretically using density function and ab initio quantum chemical techniques.  As the project has both experimental and computational aspects it exposes the undergraduate students to physical chemistry."

This is an active area of research both for its fundamental importance and its potential impacts on health.   Through the studies on model amino acids and peptides, factors that control larger peptide and protein assembly can be learned, which can help the development of new therapeutic agents.  The project is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels, including those underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities to high school students in the Ventura and Santa Barbara areas are also part of the funded project.  A free website that allows the accurate and rapid calculation of cross sections of model structures is also supported by this grant.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this grant is focused on the assembly of amino acids and small peptides.  In these studies, Ion Mobility based Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used as the main tool.  In collaboration with the group of Gert von Helden at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, IMS-MS is coupled with the Fritz Haber free electron laser to do spectroscopy on size and shape selected oligomers of both amino acids and small peptides.  The overarching goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of the amyloid cascade that is often observed for peptides and proteins in systems related to many devastating diseases.  The amyloid hypothesis states that peptides natively fold and isotropically assemble until at a system dependent size they rearrange to beta sheet and rapidly add monomers to form fibrils.  The group, in past NSF support periods, observed this process for specific peptide systems.  The current project seeks to understand these observations and to develop an algorithm that can accurately predict the predilection of a peptide or protein to form amyloid knowing only the primary structure."

These methods facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental biology, chemistry and physics underlying many of the most important biological processes in the cell.  Specifically, the team is developing a novel sensor for biophysical applications that can simultaneously measure the three-dimensional position and orientation of a nanoparticle probe. The proposed Magnetic-Probe-Imaging platform (MagPI) is expected to be widely-applicable to a range of biophysical problems where orientation and position are both of significance to biological function.  Research results will be disseminated broadly through local, national, and international conferences, publications, and laboratory research websites as well as through an advertised technical workshop on the method to facilitate its adoption by the chemical, biological, and biomedical research communities.  This work will also support graduate and undergraduate student training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment that combines physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. It will provide support for a focused unit on ""Biosensing and the Five Senses"" that will be developed for an elementary-school science outreach program, with lesson plans available to the public through the outreach website<br/><br/>The research addresses three specific aims: (i) the targeted development of a MagPI to complement commercially-available pre-functionalized nanoparticles for ease of adoption; (ii) the integration of this platform into a Tethered-Particle-Motion (TPM) assay to demonstrate platform tractability in biophysical contexts; and (iii) a demonstration of the potential for this platform by detecting expected interconversions between distinct transcription-factor-DNA complex conformations in TPM assays. The MagPI probe is unbleachable and unblinking and therefore is ideally suited to applications where precision tracking of probe 3D-position and orientation could provide significant new insights, but long-timescale and high-temporal resolution imaging is required which precludes the use of single-molecule fluorescent probes. The probe and sensor is complementary and compatible with existing contrast generation mechanisms, including brightfield, scattering, and fluorescence. Orientation and position sensing are performed by imaging the magnetic dipole field generated by the nano-particle probe. The physical mechanism for magnetic-field imaging is the B-field-induced shift of the photo-luminescence intensity of nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond sensor."

The project is focusing on BODIPY-based chromophores and aims to address a long-standing corollary concern of poor near-infrared emission of lanthanide materials in aqueous solutions. To meet the challenge, the lanthanide complexes are to be transformed to metallopolymers through carbon-carbon coupling reactions to suppress quenching and enable efficient near-infrared emission to be retained. The metallopolymers being targeted are designed to emit in the near-infrared region of the spectrum (900-1600 nm) under longer excitation wavelengths,thereby reducing autofluorescence and photobleaching."

The particular reaction of interest is important in certain next-generation strategies to increase the efficiency of solar cells by limiting waste heat production that generally occurs when higher energy solar photons are absorbed. This proposal establishes a fundamental research program where students are exposed to a considerable breadth of ideas in synthesis, spectroscopy, and applications of electronic structure theory. A specific outreach effort in collaboration with local high school teachers is part of the funded work that aims to provide sophisticated but affordable spectroscopic tools and curriculum ideas to Colorado high school science programs. <br/><br/>Singlet fission is a photophysical phenomenon observed in certain organic materials wherein light absorption produces a spin-allowed singlet excited state that then non-radiatively converts to a pair of triplet excitations. If these triplets can be further transformed to charge carriers, it is possible to envision device scenarios where the solar spectrum is more efficiently utilized compared to devices in operation today. This research is predicated on the idea that molecular dimers are the fundamental unit for singlet fission and that they can provide a platform wherein synthetic manipulations that control the spatial juxtaposition and covalent interaction of chromophores are called upon to affect key photophysical rate constants. The most important design opportunity that is being tested relates to dimer point group symmetry and the idea that it can control the interference (constructive vs. destructive) of pathways in the quantum mechanical description of diabatic coupling for singlet fission. Other strategies will call on substituents to affect the relative energy of charge transfer states."

Polymers are long chain molecules that derive many of their properties from the entanglements and interactions between the chains.  Polymers have become ubiquitous materials in our daily lives, impacting most industries, including agriculture and food, health and safety, as well as transportation.  For more than half a century, silicone polymers have been used in a variety of consumer products including contact lenses, flexible tubing, and medical implants. Most catalysts that are widely employed in silicone preparation and curing are based on precious metals such as platinum or iridium, relatively toxic elements that are costly to obtain due to their low abundance in the Earth's crust.  The development of manganese-based catalysts for silicone preparation would have the potential to supplant precious metal catalyst use, which would represent a significant advance in sustainable chemistry.  Professor Trovitch is also working to enhance student and public familiarity with green chemistry.  He is developing a sustainability workshop for local high school students, and videos based upon this program will be made available to achieve broad dissemination.

Trovitch of Arizona State University is developing sustainable manganese hydrosilylation catalysts that will exhibit comparable activity and selectivity to widely used precious metal catalysts.  Relative to second and third row transition metals, manganese remains underutilized in catalytic applications due to its propensity to participate in one-electron reaction pathways.  Recent results have shown that polydentate, redox non-innocent chelate ligands enable manganese-catalyzed carbonyl hydrosilylation by reversibly transferring electrons and partially dissociating throughout catalysis. Building on this discovery, Professor Trovitch is studying several aspects of manganese-catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions including manganese olefin hydrosilylation catalysts that can serve as replacements for ones based upon platinum, novel carbonyl hydrosilylation pathways to crosslink polyones with polyhydrosilanes or polyhydrosiloxanes, and dehydrogenative silylation pathways to the synthesis of siloxane networks.  Via electronic structure determinations and mechanistic studies, highly active manganese catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation, carbonyl hydrosilylation, and dehydrogenative silylation are being developed by judiciously modifying their ligand frameworks.  Successful completion of this project will transform current knowledge of manganese catalysis while revealing potential advantages of high-denticity redox non-innocent chelate utilization."

Controlling the spatial distributions of different metal atoms in nanocrystals offers a simple and versatile way to tailor their structures and properties. Such tailoring has the potential to vastly expand their utility as catalysts in the production of important chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as processes used for conversion of energy and protection of the environment. In this project, Dr. Younan Xia of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr. Manos Mavrikakis of the University of Wisconsin-Madison are developing a bimetallic system, in which the two metals are spatially separated from each other by an interface to form nanocrystals with a Janus structure. The bimetallic Janus nanocrystals offer a broad range of unique properties and applications, including the tuning of optical response and the enhancement of catalytic activity and/or selectivity for specific chemical products. By switching to bimetallic Janus nanocrystals and their derivatives, one can substantially reduce the amount of precious metal in a nanocrystal while potentially improving the performance, enabling Society to achieve cost-effective and sustainable use of precious metals, some of the scarcest elements in the Earth's crust. However, there are only a very limited number of reports on bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, primarily due to the lack of mechanistic understanding and experimental control for their chemical synthesis. As a major requirement for the formation of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, the atoms of one metal can only be deposited at a single site on the surface of a nanocrystal made of another metal and this particular pattern of deposition must be maintained throughout the growth process. The PIs integrate experimental studies and computational modeling in their development of predictable, deterministic, and robust synthesis of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals. They are also contributing to the preparation of a skilled workforce for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines through active engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in this collaborative, multidisciplinary research, as well as curriculum enrichment and development.

They are also investigating the thermal stability of the Janus nanocrystals with respect to atomic inter-diffusion and surface diffusion. As for applications, the Janus nanocrystals are explored as building blocks for colloidal self-assembly and as sacrificial templates for the fabrication of metal nanoboxes with a single, well-defined hole on the surface, preferably located at one of the vertices. Such nanoboxes, when made of platinum, can serve as a highly active and durable catalyst towards oxygen reduction, a reaction key to the operation of hydrogen-based fuel cells. Along with the experimental studies, computational modeling is used to explain the trends and mechanisms involved in the syntheses, as well as the catalysis taking place on some of the bimetallic nanocrystals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By controlling the shape of nanostructures, scientists can optimize their properties for a very wide range of applications. This can enable the production of cheaper solar cells, higher capacity batteries, and better catalysts that lower the energy required to produce fuels and chemicals. Many nanostructures can be grown from atoms, resulting in nanoscale crystals suspended in liquid solutions. However, nanostructure chemists do not completely understand the surface chemistry that results in growing nanostructures with a certain shape.  In this project, Prof. Wiley of Duke University is developing new analytical tools and methods to test ideas for how and why nanostructures grow to form different shapes.  Such understanding is necessary to produce large quantities of nanostructures with precisely controlled sizes and shapes in a way that minimizes the environmental impact of nanostructure manufacturing. Prof. Wiley works with Dr. Moffat at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop these analytical methods. They also organize symposia that bring together researchers focused on nanostructure synthesis and surface chemistry to cross-fertilize these disciplines with new perspectives. Prof. Wiley disseminates his work through hands-on activities at public events. He also hosts promising high school students in his lab for summer internships to encourage their pursuit of a career in scientific research. <br/><br/>Production of nanostructures relies on some form of anisotropic growth, but how and why anisotropic growth occurs in many solution-phase metal nanostructure syntheses remains a matter of debate. With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Wiley at Duke University is providing new insights into the facet-selective surface chemistry that is driving anisotropic atomic addition through the use of electrochemical measurements on single crystal surfaces, as well as by using nanostructures themselves as substrates for in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements. These measurement techniques are being used to test the hypothesis that, in syntheses of Cu, Ag, and Au nanowires, preferential adsorption of halides onto (100) facets promotes adsorption of organic capping agents onto (100) facets. This in turn leads to preferential atomic addition to (111) facets.  In addition, Prof. Wiley is determining the role of capping agents and halides in modulating the rate of nanowire growth through a combination of in situ visualization of nanowire growth rates, and single-crystal electrochemical measurements in the reaction solution. This work is forging a stronger link between the fields of metal nanostructure synthesis and electrochemistry, in part through a new electrochemical society symposium that brings together researchers from both of these fields. The analytical methods and deeper mechanistic understanding developed during this project could enable the rapid development of syntheses with higher productivities and less waste based on fast electrochemical measurements of the conditions that promote anisotropic atomic addition. Prof. Wiley is engaged in educational outreach through the Duke Chemistry Outreach Program, the Durham Museum of Life and Science, and hosting high school students in his lab for summer internships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Malcolmson is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Duke University. The development of new chemical reactions is critical to continued progress within a number of vital technologies, including materials, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals.  The needs for the development of synthetic methods include the use of cheap and abundant starting materials while generating minimal chemical waste. One reaction of interest, called a catalytic hydrofunctionalization, adds new abilities to change to readily available molecules. Hydrofunctionalization reactions are currently limited in terms of the types of molecules that can be used and the speed and selectivity of the overall process. To address these limitations, the Malcolmson laboratory is developing a number of new hydrofunctionalization reactions that form carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds. The reactions take advantage of commercially available reagents and easily accessed starting materials, and they incorporate all of the atoms from all reagents into the products (atom economy) while using minimal solvent. As such, the reactions generate very little chemical waste.  The products generated from the reactions are valuable in that they can serve as synthetic building blocks for use in the fine chemical, agrochemistry, and medicinal chemistry industries. In addition to this work, Dr. Malcolmson and his team are developing a series of short online videos to educate the public and undergraduate and graduate students about how the development of catalytic reactions has shaped the modern world through industrial applications.  This effort increases public scientific literacy and fosters an interest in science among precollege and college students while also broadening graduate education, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, the Malcolmson laboratory at Duke University is developing a number of catalytic site- and enantioselective hydroamination and hydroalkylation reactions of acyclic 1,3-dienes, including challenging internal dienes. Palladium-based catalysts with chiral chelating P,N-ligands allow for efficient and enantioselective reactions of cheap, abundant, and commercially available amines and beta-dicarbonyl pronucleophiles at room temperature within short reaction times.  Hydrofunctionalization of dienes offers an expedient and 100% atom economical way to construct compounds with allylic stereogenic centers, valuable building blocks for assembling fine chemicals, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals.  The high-value products garnered under this project are not easily prepared through competing technologies such as allylic substitution.  The methods development outlined in this application along with the accompanying mechanistic investigations may begin to address long-standing challenges in enantioselective hydrofunctionalization technologies and lay the groundwork for related future studies.  The educational outreach  focuses on increasing public understanding and appreciation for catalysis via production and distribution of a collection of short videos, relating how synthetic catalytic chemistry has shaped the modern world.

Professor Biteen works on using the high-sensitivity microscopy to understand the interaction between metal nanoparticles and the dye molecules and to control coupled emission. She is working toward a real-time, non-perturbative, biocompatible microscope for live-cell imaging. Professor Biteen works closely with undergraduate women students and students from other under-represented minority groups.  She is promoting science as an exciting field to a broad audience by supporting public lectures and developing hands-on demos for middle school girls.<br/><br/>Single-molecule, super-resolution microscopy enables direct investigations of physical and optical effects far below the half-micron diffraction limit of light, but this technique is restricted in practical applications by the limited brightness of probes relative to the background, especially in cellular samples. Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) readily produce over hundred-fold field intensity enhancements to brighten proximal dyes, but the modified dye emission also yields localization biases that have not yet been fully characterized due to the limitations of conventional experimental approaches. Professor Biteen is improving the resolution of single-molecule imaging with NP plasmonics. State-of-the-art single-molecule fluorescence experiments on dyes coupled to metal NPs can directly measure the effects of plasmonic NPs on proximal dyes. Therefore, the single-molecule readout can inform models of dye-NP interactions, while at the same time, plasmonic enhancement can improve the single-molecule fluorescence brightness. Professor Biteen is working toward high-accuracy, nanometer-scale, plasmon-enhanced super-resolution microscopy by: (1) measuring the changes in dye molecule intensity, spectrum, direction, and polarization of emission produced by a plasmonic NP, (2) controlling the dye-NP coupling by tuning the excitation polarization and frequency according to the relationships determined in objective 1, and (3) super-resolving the positions and movements of membrane proteins in living cells prepared on plasmonic surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the lack of a rational synthetic mechanism has impeded advances in NC design and applications. This project investigates new fundamental strategies for low-temperature NC syntheses that are potentially scalable to industrial volumes, and thus are compatible with current chemical manufacturing procedures. Large-scale synthesis of semiconductor NCs, especially those with reduced toxicity, may enable the development of new applications in biology and medicine, optics and photonics.

The two graduate students also organize and direct outreach efforts through interfacing with the Rochester Museum and Science Center. <br/><br/>A long-standing and significant challenge in the field of colloidal semiconductor NCs is to understand at a fundamental level how NCs are synthesized, and to use this knowledge to make improved NCs in a rational manner. The overall goal in this project is to develop a more detailed understanding of NC synthesis mechanisms in route to synthesizing NCs with improved chemical or photophysical properties. Several experiments are conducted utilizing optical, mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies to obtain more complete understanding of the chemical reaction mechanism for the NCs of interest. Also, the important relationship between charge, photoluminescence and impurity atom concentration for doped semiconductor NCs are being determined. These studies will aid in the understanding of unexplained photophysical phenomena in a wide class of nanostructured materials."

In biology and biochemistry, X-bonds have great potential to facilitate the rational design of new halogenated inhibitors against enzyme targets. This project applies a comprehensive strategy to study how structure affects the energy of biomolecular X-bonds in DNA and proteins. This project is developing a unique computational tool that can be used by biologists, biochemists and chemical biologists to rationally design new inhibitors against important enzymes. The tool would also be used to aid design of new biologically-based materials. The impact of this project on society is to improve the scientific literacy of the future workforce by engaging students at the K-12 level with experiential learning through an educational outreach project. This outreach project is introducing high school students to two important concepts in structural biology: 1) the fundamentals of 3-dimensional protein structures and 2) how those structures are experimentally determined. Finally, research training is provided to diverse groups of students, ranging from high school to postdoctoral levels, inclusive of gender, ethnicity and economic background. <br/><br/>The driving hypothesis of the proposed studies is that a force field for biological halogen bonds (ffBXB), once incorporated into a molecular mechanics/dynamics program, can be accurately and efficiently applied to design novel halogenated molecules for bioengineering applications. The project implements and tests the ffBXB in a standard molecular simulation program. The program is tested for its ability to accurately model the structures and energies of X-bonds that involve formally negatively charged oxygen acceptors in a previously-characterized experimental model DNA junction. The new program is independently cross-validated for its ability to accurately model the structures and energies of X-bonds that involve formally neutral oxygen acceptors in the model DNA junction and in T4 lysozyme. The validation studies are performed by X-ray crystallographic atomic level structure determination of these molecular systems and measuring their energies of interaction by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in solution. Free energy perturbation methods are used to study the effects of engineered X-bonds on the conformational and solvent dynamics of a biological system. The primary hypothesis is tested by applying the ffBXB to design new protein-protein interfaces. A coiled-coil polypeptide model system has been designed in which halogenated amino acids are introduced to serve as X-bond donating ""knobs"" that fit into engineered acceptor ""holes"". The resulting ""X-Zipper"" serves as a proof of concept that X-bonds can be used to facilitate specific assembly of proteins in a rational manner."

While it was described as a new renal hormone secreted into blood by the kidney to consume adrenaline and thereby lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate, no convincing demonstration of this activity was ever made. Based on a recent discovery by the principal investigator, it appears that the true function has nothing to do with blood pressure.  Renalase instead appears to be a salvage enzyme that prevents the loss of a molecule at the heart of metabolism in all living organisms.  This molecule has a tendency to alter its structure in a way that makes it useless in metabolism.  Renalase prevents the accumualtion of the inactive molecules, saving or salvaging them, by turning them back into the correct, active structure.  This function for renalase involves unprecedented enzyme chemistry that is likely to be found to be pervasive, utilized by many if not all forms of life. The intent of this award is to establish a foundational understanding of this curious new chemical activity.  As new enzyme chemistry, the investigation of renalase will be an excellent platform to teach graduate students about enzymology. Moreover, the principal investigator will integrate the discovery of new examples of this activity into an Introductory Biochemistry Laboratory class such that undergraduates can participate directly in the advancement of this research by making genuine scientific discoveries in the laboratory classroom.<br/><br/><br/>This award from the National Science Foundation, Division of Chemistry, Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Dr. Graham R.

The methods employed will use a combination of rapid-mixing pre-steady state spectrophotometric kinetic techniques, structural elucidation of substrate analog and product enzyme complexes, numerous biophysical approaches that take advantage of the spectrophotometric reporting power of the enzyme's cofactor and site directed mutagenesis of conserved active site amino acids. In addition, Dr. Moran intends to develop an undergradaute laboratory course in which students discover new examples of this chemistry in a broad range of organisms such that the course will provide new avenues of investigation by which the full importance of and context for this activity can be established."

The olefin metathesis reaction has revolutionized the synthesis of organic molecules relevant to natural and unnatural products for treatment of diseases such as cancers and AIDS, as well as the synthesis of specialty materials.

Magnetic resonance measurements (similar to those in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI) can reveal key information about molecular structure and bonding, but they have hardly ever been made at THz frequencies because of technological challenges with the sources of THz light. Professor Nelson overcomes these challenges using short THz pulses generated in a simple, tabletop-sized, experimental setup to make THz magnetic resonance measurements in about one minute. Measurements of molecular and biomolecular complexes with iron or similar elements are being conducted to understand molecular structures and how they change during chemical processes. The project has broader impacts in making facile and inexpensive THz measurement available to scientific communities in chemistry, biology, and materials science with applications spanning energy harvesting to chemical catalysis to biomedical measurement.

THz EPR spectra of high-spin transition metal complexes with zero-field splittings that arise from spin-orbit coupling are measured. The splittings are highly sensitive to the ligands and their configuration around the central transition metal ion. The EPR measurement can be preceded by an optical (""pump"") pulse that initiates photochemical changes, with associated changes in the spin states monitored on picosecond time scales. 2D THz EPR measurements, demonstrated on the collective spin states of magnetic materials, are being extended to multinuclear organometallic complexes in order to measure spin-spin interactions between the transition metal ions, revealing detailed information about the ground and excited-state electronic structures of the complexes. In addition to these measurements in which THz magnetic fields coherently drive electron spins, the combined THz electric and magnetic field components are being used to drive both electric and magnetic dipole moments of chiral molecules in experiments that seek new methods for enantiometric separation.

Electron-electron repulsion makes it difficult to calculate precisely the properties and behaviors of molecules, and remains one of the greatest challenges for the science of chemistry. With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Robert Field and his research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are using advanced laser and microwave spectroscopy techniques to prepare and interrogate what are called Rydberg molecules. A Rydberg molecule is a normal molecule in which one electron has been excited (by laser light) to such a high orbit that the system resembles a simple hydrogen atom (one negatively charged electron plus one positively charged proton). Because of their simplicity, Rydberg molecules can be modeled more accurately with theory, and it becomes possible to answer other questions with more accuracy, for example, how do electrons interact with light? Or how do electrons exchange energy with each other and with the positive-charged ""ion core"" of the molecule? This research project challenges conventional thinking about the structure of molecules and how they interact with light. The discoveries from this project may also have implications for the new field of quantum computing. The post-doctoral scientists and undergraduate researchers engaged in this project are gaining experience in both cutting-edge laser/microwave technology and computational chemistry. <br/><br/>This project is focused on three experimental goals and targeted at answers to three fundamental questions. The feasibilities of the principal experimental components have been independently demonstrated. The experimental goals are: (i) to record Rydberg-Rydberg spectra at a spectral velocity of 100,000 resolution elements per second, organized and assigned by a suite of on-the-fly diagnostics; (ii) to exploit systematic spectroscopic access to core-nonpenetrating Rydberg states, bypassing a region of fast nonradiative decay previously deemed to be impassible (called the ""zone of death""); (iii) to exploit superradiance on Rydberg-Rydberg transitions to obtain information about quantum many-body interactions.  If these experiments are successful, our methods and results will challenge spectroscopists to imagine and target new frontiers for the spectroscopy of gas phase molecules.   This project is leading to new methods for  the determination of multipole moments an polarizabilities of molecular-ions, which are essential to model dense plasmas, which are relevant to astrophysics and new technologies.  The refinement of Multi-channel Quantum Defect Theory promises a priori calibrated methods for production of state-selected molecular ions devise new classes of schemes for external control of molecular dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will utilize a recently developed layer-by-layer chemical electrodeposition method for preparing nanometer-thick crystalline LTMS films to probe the active site structure and mechanism of ORR on these materials. From these studies, the work aims to extract broad periodic trends and overarching design principles that will be used to synthesize high-performance nanoparticulate LTMS ORR catalysts primed for integration into advanced fuel cell cathodes"

Professors Billiot and Billiot of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, Kevin Morris of Carthage College, and Yayin Fang of Howard University form a multi-institutional collaboration. The work focuses on the investigation and elucidation of the factors responsible for molecular self-assembly, and how these factors affect the ability of the self-assembled molecular structures to interact and recognize other molecules of biological importance. A variety of experimental and computational methods are used to developed Quantitative Structure Enantioselective Retention Relationships (QSERR). QSERR is then used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different chiral selectors for capillary electrophoretic separations. Two of the three institutions are primarily undergraduate institutions that currently do not have a master's program in chemistry. Thus, the research will be conducted at these two schools exclusively by undergraduate students. One of these is also a Hispanic Serving Institution. The third university involved in the research is an HBCU. The research serves as a tool for the PIs to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds and to encourage these students to pursue post baccalaureate degrees in science.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is part of an ongoing, long-term multi-faceted study focusing on investigating and elucidating the factors responsible for (a) self-assembly, (b) function, (c) higher ordered structure and (d) molecular recognition of amino acid based macromolecular assemblies (AABMAs). In particular, the research will focus on examining the effects that pH, ionic strength, surfactant concentration, and type of counter-ion have on the factors mentioned above. These AABMAs are being utilized in this study as chiral pseudostationary phases in capillary electrophoresis. Thus, the major focus of these studies is to gain insights into the factors responsible for chiral recognition with this class of chiral selector. A deeper understanding of these factors will lead to enhanced chiral separations and improved pseudostationary phases. Understanding such interactions is not only important in the development of chiral recognition media but also in the optimization of the separation conditions. In addition, since enantiorecognition of the systems under study are amino acids, the knowledge gained from these studies will be potentially transferable to other amino acid based systems such as proteins."

This sulfur-sulfur chemical bond can be found in opened or closed states under different biological conditions, such as during different physiological stresses or within unique cellular locations. To study the functional impact of the disulfide bond in a permanently closed state, one sulfur atom is replaced by a carbon atom to generate an alternative bond that is locked in place under all biologically relevant conditions.

Current peptide synthesis utilizes a solid phase approach, where the amino acid links of a peptide chain are added one at a time, in a specified sequence. This technique revolutionized peptide synthesis when it was introduced, but as currently implemented it is a highly wasteful process, with typical reaction conditions utilizing five times the amount of excess reagents for every amide bond synthesized.  Professor Arora's work is building on classical and recent advances in peptide synthesis to develop new, more efficient approaches. In the new approach, excess reagents are replaced with optimized catalysts giving an efficient, ""green"" catalytic cycle.  This research has applications in pharmaceutical and biomedical industries.  The project provides valuable training to students at the interface of chemistry and biology. Students engaged in the project gain experience in molecular design, conformational analysis, organic synthesis, and biochemistry.  Professor Arora co-directs the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in Chemical Biology at NYU.  This site introduces young scientists to this rapidly growing and technologically-important research field by incorporating studies from the project into the REU curriculum.

This project advances the fundamental understanding of human health and produces a well-educated, diverse workforce in STEM. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop new methods of amide bond synthesis that are both atom-efficient and sustainable. There is an urgent need for methods that do not require excess reagents and are mild enough to not lead to epimerizaton of adjacent stereocenters.  In this project, amide bond formation is accelerated by organocatalysts that transiently enforce a hydrogen-bonding-mediated intramolecular reaction between the carboxyl and amine termini of two fragments. The new approach engages the substrates through non-covalent and covalent interactions to reduce the entropic penalty of organizing the optimal transition state for catalysis.  The project includes significant educational and outreach activities including the integration of new laboratory experiment modules based on the science of the project within undergraduate chemistry courses at NYU.

Even more remarkably, the nickel in lactate racemase is present in a unique environment never before observed.  This project investigates how the bacterium makes the cofactor that creates the unique environment.

Blackwell from the University of Wisconsin-Madison to investigate the chemical signals that bacteria use to communicate with each other. This communication pathway is important, as many common bacteria use it to initiate infections in humans, animals, and plants. This project aims to study the chemical structures of the signals used by one class of bacteria and use the obtained information to design and create signals that the bacteria cannot make themselves. These non-natural signals are used to activate and inhibit bacterial communications pathways on demand. Such a chemical approach provides fundamental new insights into the biological mechanisms by which bacteria communicate and shape basic understanding of bacterial signaling. Realization of these project goals is providing research training  for graduate students in modern experimental techniques, preparing them for advanced careers in science. Another major thrust of this project is, in collaboration with an established artist, creating artwork and an immersive installation piece where the potential of bacteria to act as cooperative partners is re-imagined. This medium is being used in communicating the presence of bacteria, their chemical signaling networks, and their importance to a broad non-scientist audience in the USA and beyond. <br/><br/>The broad goals of this research project are to characterize the chemistry and biology of the autoinducing peptides used by Gram-positive bacteria for cell-cell communication, or ""quorum sensing"" (QS), and to exploit these findings for the development of new chemical tools. QS in Gram-positive bacteria depends on peptide-derived signals and is best characterized in staphylococcal species. These bacteria use agr-type, two-component signaling systems for QS that are reliant on autoinducing peptide (AIP) signals and cognate AgrC receptors. Many infection-related (i.e., virulence) phenotypes are under the control of the agr QS system. Accordingly, there is significant interest in the development of chemical and biological strategies to modulate agr-type QS signaling and thereby attenuate the impact of these pathogens. Professor Blackwell's laboratory recently discovered a suite of non-native, AIP-derived peptides that are the most potent synthetic inhibitors and activators of AgrC receptors, and thereby QS. Despite their potency, AIP-derived AgrC modulators possess physical qualities that limit their utility as chemical tools. Further, there is a lack of basic mechanistic understanding of how these ligands interact with AgrC receptors and modulate their function. This project addresses these limitations with the integrated use of synthetic chemical, biochemical, microbiological and structural biological approaches. The expectation is an expansion in the current knowledge of agr-type QS."

Only two biological systems are capable of exploiting light as a source of energy: chlorophyll systems and rhodopsins. Chlorophyll systems are complex, composed of dozens of protein and pigment molecules. Rhodopsins, on the other hand, consist of one protein and one retinal molecule assembled in a simple architecture. In spite of such simplicity, rhodopsins carry out a variety of important light-powered functions such as ion-pumping, ion-channeling and color-sensing in microorganisms, and vision in invertebrates and vertebrates. These photoswitchable properties are of enormous interest in tailoring proteins for use as specialized probes, actuators, and switches. This research uses a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena as a reference system. Professor Olivucci's ARM (Automatic Rhodopsin Model) protocol is used to construct a large number of computationally ""mutated"" rhodopsins, involving an artificial amino acid substitution in the protein sequence. ARM is used to simulate the mutated protein using a combination of classical and advanced quantum mechanical techniques, and predict the relationship between the changes in protein sequence and specific responses to light. Large numbers of mutated rhodopsins can be computationally generated and simulated in parallel, enormously extending the range and diversity of variants that can be explored. This project will extend ARM to predict a range of new properties, with the goal of developing a systematic theory of rhodopsin light sensitivity for application to fluorescence microscopy, molecular evolution, and optogenetics. ARM is being implemented by BGSU students as an online web-based server to facilitate open student and researcher access to the protocol. This will allow high school students and undergraduates to generate and explore sophisticated, atomic-scale rhodopsin models without requiring significant theoretical background. Professor Olivucci is integrating ARM into the BGSU graduate program in photochemical science, to provide a novel introduction to structural and functional photobiology using molecular visualization techniques complemented by 3D printing capabilities.  <br/><br/>This aim of this project is to understand how proteins control elementary photochemical reactions by developing a novel computational technology. Building on Professor Olivucci's ARM protocol for the fast and automated construction of QM/MM models of light-responsive proteins, a more accurate, second-generation version will be developed featuring free energy calculation capabilities and an expanded benchmark set. The goal is to learn how to reprogram protein spectroscopy and thermochemical and photochemical reactivity by tailoring the chemical properties of a protein reference system---in this project, a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena. The construction and analysis of sets of mutated models and their experimental verification are expected to reveal novel engineering principles. More specifically, and together with external collaborators, Professor Olivucci is learning how mutations may control the excited state isomerization dynamics and lifetime of the system and, among other applications, to use this knowledge to design, and express in the laboratory, fluorescent rhodopsins that could be employed as sensors in optogenetics. Specific aims of the research include computationally screening large numbers of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) mutants, searching for ASR mutants exhibiting longer excited state lifetimes, and improving the accuracy, applicability and automation of ARM to a level suitable for dissemination and broad use by the scientific community."

Despite their prominent role in biological redox mechanisms, heme propionates (HPs) have received little attention and their reactivity is not well understood. Using three systems of progressively increasing complexity (a heme peptide, a monoheme protein cytochrome (cyt) c2, and a tetraheme protein cyt c3), this project is establishing the factors set by the biological environment to control the interplay between proton transfer (PT) and electron transfer (ET) in HP-mediated PCET reactions. The effects of the biologically relevant solvent, protein scaffold, neighboring amino acids, and multiple redox centers on the PCET reaction landscape are being examined. With special emphasis on methods to monitor elusive PT steps, thorough characterization of the reaction mechanisms, the studies are addressing major challenges in the PCET field. Site-specific labeling techniques are enabling determination of redox-dependent pKa values of HPs by NMR and explicit observation of both ET and PT steps in photoinduced studies with electronic absorption and vibrational spectroscopic methods. Isothermal titration calorimetry is being used as a novel label-free approach to identify redox-dependent changes in HP protonation, examine a possibility of intraprotein proton relay, and evaluate reactions with buffers. The detailed studies of less understood HP-mediated reactions is expanding the mechanistic database of PCET reactions, which is important for the development of predictive tools. These studies are advancing the understanding of ubiquitous heme proteins and are yielding valuable tools and tactics for mechanistic studies of other redox centers, both biological and man-made."

Such protein engineering is of growing importance to academic and pharmaceutical research due to the mild and green conditions under which the biological world operates. Therefore the goal of this work is to combine engineering and evolution to create enzyme scaffolds that assemble in cells and which can incorporate building blocks not typically found in nature. This research expands the chemical diversity and reaction landscape available to protein engineers and generates new tools with broad applications in biotechnology and biomedical imaging, as well as chemical synthesis. Dr. Brustad has developed a symposium for biotechnology research to foster communication and collaboration between local scientists and students. This symposium is now expanded to promote diversity by reaching out to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  Dr. Brustad is also developing a hands-on educational modules for K-12 populations in rural North Carolina, serving primarily young African American and Hispanic populations.<br/><br/>This research introduces a new paradigm for the construction of non-natural metallocofactor proteins in cells through the creation of orthogonal heme/enzyme pairs. An orthogonal heme:enzyme pair is composed of two key components: 1) a non-natural, synthetic cofactor that is similar to heme but does not interact with existing heme enzymes, and 2) an evolved heme-binding protein that recognizes only the non-natural cofactor. This ""orthogonality"" creates a new cofactor:enzyme system that can interact self-sufficiently in cells without disrupting endogenous cofactors or enzymes. A significant advantage of this approach is that it simply builds on (and adapts to) existing cofactor-binding motifs in nature to construct binding sites for metals and cofactor catalysts not typically found in nature. Scaffolds identified from this study provide robust and systematically adaptable artificial metalloproteins for green chemical synthesis as well as metal-based imaging applications. In addition, this program is focused on broadening the impact of biotechnology research by expanding education outreach to young underrepresented minorities and undergraduates students as well as fostering increased scientific communication among research institutions across the state of North Carolina."

Bacteria surround themselves with ""jackets"" called bacterial cell wall to protect themselves from environmental insults. The ultimate goal of this research is to determine how different organisms bind to and are activated by bacterial cell wall fragments leading to an immune response. This information is critical in understanding how a variety of species have solved the problem of binding bacterial cell wall ligands as an initial step in a stimulated response. Using synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology, the principal investigator is developing a framework of understanding of how bacterial cell wall ligands are recognized across nature. This work ultimately results in a deeper understanding of how three systems; bacterial, human and fungal, function in a common environment. As part of this CAREER award, the principal investigator is developing creative mechanisms for educating students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, on how chemists begin to understand the problem of molecular recognition. There are three educational objectives that are integrated with each other, draw inspiration from the problem of sensing bacterial cell walls and are directed at teaching students what it means to be a scientist. The activities involve: (a) partnering with an expert in Early Childhood Education to develop and implement a new curriculum for grades K to 2 focused on how a chemist ""senses"" phenomena such as light and sound, (b) developing a program to enhance the chemistry background of K to 2 educators, allowing them to more readily approach science concepts when they start their own careers and (c) developing and implementing an introductory biochemistry lab in which undergraduate biochemistry majors use problem-based learning (PBL) to understand how concepts in molecular recognition are used in antibiotics that target the destruction of bacterial cell wall.<br/><br/>Organisms from plants to humans take advantage of the strong polymer unique to the bacterial cell wall to recognize the presence of a bacterial cell. However, the molecular details of recognition are not well understood. This project involves the preparation of synthetic analogues of bacterial cell wall to investigate the binding events used by mammalian and fungal systems. The use of these systems allows a comparison of the solutions devised by nature to bind the highly conserved polymer that comprises the cell wall. In two objectives, this research determines the binding events that drive the recognition of bacterial cell wall fragments by innate immune human and fungus receptors. The principal investigator is using chemical synthesis to build modified, tagged versions of bacterial cell wall fragments that are used for the identification and characterization of the binding sites for these molecules and their respective receptors. Bacterial cell wall fragment binding proteins Cyr1p, Nod1 and Nod2, from yeast and humans are being used in the investigation. These proteins are structurally diverse and each has been shown to be stimulated by bacterial cell wall fragments. The principal investigator makes use of a dynamic approach in refining the rules for binding to bacterial cell wall fragments.

The strategy being developed relies on DNA molecules capable of folding into complex three-dimensional structures and adhering to specific targets of interest. The DNA serves as an adhesive to bring a modifying chemical structure into close proximity, resulting in selective modification of the target.

The methanogens use simple one- and two-carbon compounds as substrates to form methane utilizing one of Nature's most fascinating nickel enzymes, methyl coenzyme M reductase. Approximately one billion tons of methane is generated every year by methanogenesis. In view of its relative abundance and clean burning properties, methane continues to be an attractive fuel. On the other hand, methane is also a potent greenhouse gas. This project is focused on elucidating specific aspects of the mechanism of function of MCR. A greater understanding of MCR mechanism and the process of methanogenesis may enable design of enzymes for reducing agricultural methane emissions and provide a basis for improving bioreactor technology to produce, capture, and store methane as a source of sustainable energy.

For many of these applications, the incorporation of MOF thin films grown directly on supporting materials is required.  To effectively fabricate devices with smart interfaces that harness the properties of these MOF materials, it is crucial to understand the fundamentals of film formation.  This research systematically investigates thin film MOF growth and develops design rules for low-energy processing techniques on a variety of technologically-relevant substrates.  These design rules, for tailoring film structure and composition, are utilized 1) to tune the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of the film and 2) to develop fabrication techniques that integrate MOF thin films into cutting-edge technologies for chemical sensing and harvesting solar energy.  Undergraduate students are actively engaged in all aspects of the research, providing them with experience in the interdisciplinary areas of materials chemistry, surface science, and modern analytical instrumentation.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>With this award the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanchemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. Anderson at Hope College to investigate the formation of surface-anchored metal-organic frameworks (SurMOF) for integration directly into device architectures for chemical sensing and photonic applications.  Film formation is studied for different systems with incrementally increasing complexity (i.e. HKUST-1, MOF-14, MOF-5, IRMOF-3).  Effects of deposition variables such as temperature, time, and deposition methods (i.e. layer-by-layer, co-deposition, seeded deposition) are investigated.  Studies are extended to understand deposition on different substrates of technological relevance, such as oxide materials (i.e. SiO2, ITO, Al2O3) and flexible polymeric materials.  Rational design rules for growth initiation as well as inhibition are determined.  Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and surface-specific spectroscopies (i.e. ellipsometry, FT-IR) are used to characterize SurMOF film growth to determine the effect of deposition conditions with particular focus on foundational layers forming at the substrate-film interface.  Mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of films are evaluated using advanced SPM modes (i.e. quantitative nanomechanical mapping, conductive probe), electrochemistry (i.e. cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry), and spectroelectrochemical characterization. By following developed design rules, understanding material properties, and employing membrane-templating techniques, this research integrates SurMOF films as smart interfaces into test-bed structures fabricated for chemical sensing and solar energy harvesting."

Venoms of brown recluse spiders have toxins that cause the death of cells and tissue in mammals, but also help the spiders immobilize and/or digest insect prey.  The toxins that are known to affect mammals can damage cell surfaces by cutting a specific ""head group"", called choline, off of a molecule called a sphingolipid. Other recluse spider toxins can only cut off a different kind of head group, called ethanolamine, that mammals do not have in their sphingolipids, so these toxins may be less harmful to mammals. Many insects have both kinds of head group, so both types of toxin are probably important for predation, perhaps in different ways. Dr. Cordes, a structural biologist and biochemist, and Dr. Binford, a biologist and expert on venomous invertebrates, combine their expertise to determine how these toxins distinguish the different head groups, and what the biological consequences are for predators and their prey. The specific action of these toxins on different head groups could also make them useful in biotechnology for detecting or manipulating different kinds of cell surfaces.  The broader impacts of this project  involve outreach through mentorship of undergraduates doing integrative and collaborative research at two different institutions.  Spiders attract public interest and afford an opportunity to inform the public on scientific investigations on the subject. An innovative program known as ""SpiderFest"" is conduucted both at the laboratory and at a science expo in Portland. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand the causes and effects of substrate head group (ethanolamine vs. choline) preference in phospholipase D toxins from recluse spiders. The specific goals are to map interfacial binding sites in the toxins, elucidate amino-acid sequence determinants of substrate head group preference; characterize the evolution of substrate preference in the recluse spider toxin family; and correlate head group preference to biological effects of the toxins. Methods to be used include NMR, X-ray crystallography, computational structural biology, site-directed mutagenesis, phylogenetic reconstruction, enzymatic assays, and biological assays. Information from this study illuminates differential recognition, by proteins that act at membrane surfaces, of the two most common lipid head groups in nature, phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine. The project also sheds light on toxin recruitment and specialization in venoms and interesting aspects of arthropod biochemistry and neurobiology.

This project addresses a newly-recognized class of 'electron transferring flavoproteins' (Etfs) that act as energy brokers, trading quantity for quality by accepting pairs of modest-energy electrons and concentrating their energy onto just one of the pair to produce one high-energy electron.  Crucially, this biochemical 'step-up station' makes it possible for cells to fix nitrogen gas from air to generate their own fertilizer, making food production possible where it otherwise would not be.  The project seeks to understand HOW these Etfs accomplish this complex process. The research seeks to learn what is special about the site at which energy is reallocated among the two electrons by studying the molecule on which this happens (this flavin is a derivative of the riboflavin vitamin B2).  The research also seeks to identify safety mechanisms built into the protein scaffold that allow such demanding transformations to occur within a benign, non-toxic protein.  Thus the work aims to articulate the underlying principles of the process, so that they can be designed into human-made devices and materials, to increase our ability to use solar power and boost the efficiency and versatility with which we use electrical energy in general.  Flavins are just one example of many plant pigments that present powerful chemical properties along with glorious colors.  The project scientists share their enthusiasm for pigments via a series of workshops and a course on plant pigments, fibers and fragrances in which participants create a fiber art project using natural materials while learning about the chemical principles underlying plant colors.  This creative chemistry course gives all participants a chance to design experiments and integrate science and art.<br/><br/>A long-familiar family of proteins has recently been found to have a surprising capacity to re-allocate energy among pairs of electrons acquired from NADH, yielding one with more reducing power than the NADH source (electron transfer bifurcation, or 'bifurcation').  This research establishes which of the two flavins plays which of the contrasting roles identified in the newly-purified bifurcating electron transferring flavoprotein (Etf), and then seeks to understand what aspects of the protein environment are responsible for each of the different activities (conventional electron transfer vs. bifurcation).  Spectroelectrochemical titrations measure the extent to which individual amino acids change the flavin reduction potentials (Eo) in proteins bearing amino acid substitutions, and spectroscopic studies elucidate changes in flavin covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding and protonation states, mapping out the active site's role in producing bifurcating activity.  Residues to be targeted include a cysteine common to all the Etfs associated with nitrogen fixation but not conserved in others.  Thus the research may reveal the protein context needed in order to exploit flavins' capacity for this reactivity while suppressing side-effects.  The objective is to elucidate principles underlying the versatility and efficiency of bifurcation, for implementation beyond biochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neal Waxham at University of Texas (UT) Health-Houston to investigate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. The initiation of learning begins with changes at neuronal synapses that can strengthen (or weaken) the response of the synapse. This process is termed synaptic plasticity. Stimuli that produce learning lead to structural changes of the post-synaptic dendritic spine. The initial events of memory and learning include a temporary rise in calcium concentrations and activation of a protein called calmodulin. The next step is activation of calmodulin-dependent enzyme, kinase II (CaMKII).  At the same time, structural rearrangements occur in the actin cytoskeleton leading to an enlargement of the spine compartment. How these initial events lead to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is largely unknown. This project focuses on the events that lead to the changes in actin cytoskeleton. The research also addresses the question of how these structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton are used to maintain memory. State-of-the-art computational modeling is used to answer these questions. Modeling is applied at molecular and supra-molecular scales. The models examine molecular changes that bridge the time scales between the initial steps and start of synaptic plasticity. The computational modeling goes hand in hand with state-of-the-art structural and functional imaging and biochemical pathway analyses. The research allows graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in computer simulations and mathematical modeling of a subcellular system. The students and fellows acquire an understanding of the brain starting from a molecular level.  The team of theoreticians and experimentalists working cooperatively on this problem strengthens the training process. This project is integrated into an outreach program to introduce undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to science by participating in the research.<br/><br/>This research project quantitatively characterizes the relevant molecular processes involved in the dynamical ""tectonic"" reorganization inside a dendritic spine involved in forming memories.  It focuses on the actin cytoskeleton using computer simulations and experimental analyses at both molecular and supra-molecular scales. This study therefore contributes directly to understanding the role of mechanics and structure in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Explicitly, the hypothesis is that the transient effects from calcium influx create, in a CaMKII-dependent manner, changes in the spatial patterning of the actin structure. Such changes may be be stabilized by feedback loops with prion-like proteins. These stabilized structures may be a type of ""structural engram"" which then serves as long-term reservoir for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength in the postsynaptic neuron. Testing, modifying, and verifying this hypothesis may help point the way towards a more quantitatively-sophisticated approach to the first stages of learning and memory in the brain."

Differences in gene expression lead to differentiation, such that a skin cell is different from a liver cell, for example.  Research into understanding how genes are expressed is an important area because the factors that control gene expression can lead to many diseases.  One factor that controls gene expression, but that is poorly understood, is a phenomenon called protein methylation, which involves the ""tagging"" of certain proteins with a molecule, here a methyl group.  Studies indicate that incorrect methylation is a critical component in many diseases, particularly cancer, and that the processes that lead to methylation are potential medicinal targets.  However, the ability to detect methylation is currently severely limited.

Proteins are the workhorses of biology. They perform more than 20,000 different chemical and mechanical functions in humans, and in all other living organisms. A major challenge in understanding the detailed mechanisms of biology is that proteins are not rigid objects. They move and twist in ways that are essential for their function. This is often where the crucial recognition between molecules takes place, as molecules adapt and pull on each other to confirm that they are interacting with the correct partner, much as two hands adapt during a handshake. These crucial motions can be studied via atomically-detailed computer simulations, using classical approximations to the underlying quantum mechanical forces, known as force fields.  Force fields enable the accurate simulation of proteins and their interactions, studies that would otherwise be intractable, even on the largest supercomputers. In addition to fundamental biological studies, accurate force fields are essential for drug discovery and the design of novel nanoscale and biomimetic materials.  Professor Simmerling, in collaboration with Qin Wu of Brookhaven National Laboratory, is performing a comprehensive, systematic, physics-based reshaping of one of the most important models used in molecular dynamics simulations of biophysical and biomolecular systems, the Amber force field. The goal of the project is to significantly improve the force field's accuracy and fidelity, while preserving its ability to simulate large biomolecular systems for long times. The newly-parameterized force field will be made freely available for download and use by the simulation community, for use within the most widely-used molecular dynamics simulation codes running on XSEDE supercomputers and small lab clusters. Outreach efforts for the project include regular research and recruitment trips to HBCU institutions, coordinated through the SBU Center for Inclusive Education, and the recruitment of undergraduates from underrepresented minorities to participate in the research.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to systematically and consistently address several key limitations of existing protein classical force fields in order to improve their accuracy without dramatically increasing computational complexity. Current models work in some cases, but fail to agree with experiment in many others, including quantitative reproduction of amino-acid specific properties such as helical propensity. Professor Simmerling, in conjunction with collaborator Qin Wu of Brookhaven National Laboratory, is developing more accurate descriptions of the energy profiles for protein backbone structure and dynamics, with better sequence-dependent structure and dynamics, in order to extend and reparameterize the Amber force field. The project has three principal aims: (1) to improve the description of backbone energetics through fitting to multidimensional scans using high-level QM calculations in solution, (2) to expand the Amber force field parameter library to include non-standard amino acids encountered in biology and those frequently used as experimental probes, and (3) to begin to address longstanding weaknesses in the treatment of short-range van der Waals interactions, by taking advantage of recent advances in quantum mechanical energy decomposition methods to train alternate functional forms. These should improve the ability of the model to reproduce the known influence of side chain rotamer on backbone conformational preference. The new force field models are being validated, documented, and distributed via the widely-used Amber molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program, and can be independently downloaded for use in conjunction with other widely-used MD codes.  Education and outreach is focused on recruiting and providing lab research experiences for students from underrepresented groups at SBU, and encouraging student interest in science and research through outreach trips to HBCU institutions."

Venoms of brown recluse spiders have toxins that cause the death of cells and tissue in mammals, but also help the spiders immobilize and/or digest insect prey.  The toxins that are known to affect mammals can damage cell surfaces by cutting a specific ""head group"", called choline, off of a molecule called a sphingolipid. Other recluse spider toxins can only cut off a different kind of head group, called ethanolamine, that mammals do not have in their sphingolipids, so these toxins may be less harmful to mammals. Many insects have both kinds of head group, so both types of toxin are probably important for predation, perhaps in different ways. Dr. Cordes, a structural biologist and biochemist, and Dr. Binford, a biologist and expert on venomous invertebrates, combine their expertise to determine how these toxins distinguish the different head groups, and what the biological consequences are for predators and their prey. The specific action of these toxins on different head groups could also make them useful in biotechnology for detecting or manipulating different kinds of cell surfaces.  The broader impacts of this project  involve outreach through mentorship of undergraduates doing integrative and collaborative research at two different institutions.  Spiders attract public interest and afford an opportunity to inform the public on scientific investigations on the subject. An innovative program known as ""SpiderFest"" is conduucted both at the laboratory and at a science expo in Portland. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand the causes and effects of substrate head group (ethanolamine vs. choline) preference in phospholipase D toxins from recluse spiders. The specific goals are to map interfacial binding sites in the toxins, elucidate amino-acid sequence determinants of substrate head group preference; characterize the evolution of substrate preference in the recluse spider toxin family; and correlate head group preference to biological effects of the toxins. Methods to be used include NMR, X-ray crystallography, computational structural biology, site-directed mutagenesis, phylogenetic reconstruction, enzymatic assays, and biological assays. Information from this study illuminates differential recognition, by proteins that act at membrane surfaces, of the two most common lipid head groups in nature, phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine. The project also sheds light on toxin recruitment and specialization in venoms and interesting aspects of arthropod biochemistry and neurobiology. These toxins could also be developed into valuable analytical tools to probe important differences in cell surface structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical signals are packed into vesicles in a ""sending"" cell that are expelled in the direction of a ""receiving"" cell.  Many molecules must organize in space and time to trigger the fusion of a vesicle with the receiving cell membrane. In doing so, cells are capable of releasing hormones and neurotransmitters on demand.  The research examines two of these critical fusion-inducing molecules and their relation to one another.  This work allows undergraduate and graduate students to be trained in the field of biophysical chemistry where they master cutting-edge technology for observing the behavior of cells.  Throughout this project, research and education are integrated into outreach events for students in Denver Public Schools and in the education of non-science majors at the University of Denver. The scientific results of this work are disseminated at scientific conferences and through publications to ensure incorporation of the new found knowledge into the bigger picture of how cells function in the brain and nervous system. <br/><br/>The process of membrane fusion requires an input of energy to merge the vesicle lipid bilayer with that of the plasma membrane. In doing so, the membrane quickly transforms from a relatively flat bilayer to a negatively curved tube to form the fusion pore. Although SNARE proteins drive fusion, it is hypothesized that certain lipids aid in the formation of the negatively curved pore. The formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid that forms negatively curved membranes in vitro, is thought to occur at the fusion site to stabilize the membrane shape changes. Evidence shows that inhibition of the enzyme that makes PA, Phospholipase D1, reduces the amount of PA at the plasma membrane and membrane fusion is blocked. Despite knowing that the presence of PA dramatically affects exocytosis, a clear picture of the timing of PA formation and accumulation at the fusion site is not known. Using high resolution, fluorescence imaging methods, the location of PA and Phospholipase D1 are mapped in time during secretion. This research uses a combination of biochemical reconstitution studies in conjunction with mammalian cell culture to characterize how PA is recruited to the fusion site and how PA affects membrane curvature. Ultimately, the findings determine how PA facilitates exocytosis and lead to a molecular understanding of lipid sorting in cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many chemical and biological processes involve  reactions where electrons are transferred from one molecule to another.  Nature is known to use metalloproteins to control these electron transfers so that they occur within specific pairs of molecules. This research synthesizes mimics of biological metalloproteins that have use in very specific electron transfers. These metalloproteins are also used in catalytic processes involved in solar energy conversion and fuel cells. The research projects educate graduate and undergraduate students as the next generation of scientists. The knowledge and skills acquired from multiple fields are preparing students to tackle difficult problems facing science and society. The Yi group includes students from diverse demographics. The UIUC campus infrastructure is enhanced by developing lecture and lab modules to integrate the multidisciplinary research results of the project into graduate and undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>This project seeks an enhanced quantitative understanding of the factors that fine-tune metalloprotein redox potentials (E) and applies the knowledge gained to design systems with modulated functional properties.  Many studies have identified which factors are important for tuning the E. Much less information is available on how these features quantitatively contribute to E tuning.  To achieve this goal, unnatural amino acids are engineered in both primary and secondary coordination spheres of the metal to isolate one factor (e.g., steric) from another (e.g., electronic). In this approach, E tuning becomes more predictable and quantitative. Previously, Professor Yi's lab demonstrated that tuning of a type 1 copper azurin is sufficient to span the entire 2 volt physiological range. In order to advance knowledge beyond cupredoxins, loop-directed mutagenesis is used to incorporate a type 1 copper center into ephrin-B2, a protein that does not contain a redox center. Redox tuning and secondary coordination effects through mutations are used to control reversible Sulfur-nitrosylation catalyzed by a red copper azurin. The success of the project is assessed by a) the range of E achieved through natural and unnatural amino acid incorporation; b) the predictability of E resulting from mutations; and c) the degree of control achieved in reversible NO binding."

Beyond their nutritional value, sugars play numerous other critical roles in biology.  For example, they are attached to the outside of cells like an identification number for cell-cell recognition.  Recognition depends on the specific shapes the molecules adopt on the cell surface. They fit together much like the pieces of a puzzle.  The shapes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein molecules are determined routinely, but sugar structures defy solution so far.  The research targets the discovery of a general method for the determination of sugar structures in solution based on both experiments and theory.  When the experimental structures match the theoretical ones, there is confidence that the shape is obtained correctly.  This new approach is entirely general, applicable to any sugar in solution.  Senior investigators, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates with interests and expertise in experimental and computational science collaborate to achieve the goals of the project.  Research by Professor Serianni has been commercialized at Omicron Biochemicals, Inc., which he cofounded in 1982. Omicron prepares sugars and their derivatives based on novel reactions.  These sugars are used in fundamental chemical, biochemical and biological research, in biomedical and clinical studies, and in the development of diagnostic tools. Omicron regularly collaborates with the Professor Serianni's laboratory at Notre Dame by providing synthetic expertise and reagents to support fundamental and applied studies of sugar chemistry and biochemistry.<br/><br/>This research project uses stable isotopically labeled oligosaccharides, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-couplings, and density functional theory calculations and circular statistics to determine conformational populations of the flexible domains of oligosaccharides in solution.  This experimental approach is possible because saccharides contain multiple redundant NMR spin-couplings that report on the same conformational domain, allowing quantitative treatments that yield populational models. Depending on the domain, single- and multi-state models are tested.  Once a given domain is parameterized (e.g., an O-glycosidic linkage), its conformational properties are investigated in different structural contexts to determine the degree to which it adapts conformationally to environmental cues.  Experimentally-derived models are compared to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to validate the latter. This work may lead to new experiment-based conformational classifications of O-glycosidic linkages in oligosaccharides, and to a deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence oligosaccharide conformation in solution."

This research will develop a novel approach towards studying these reactions by combining laboratory experiments with computational chemistry to better understand how these metalloproteins function.  This methodology will be applied to the study of hydrogen production and oxidation in natural and engineered enzymes, with future potential applications for alternative energy, sustainable fuels, carbon dioxide fixation, and nitrogen cycling, among others.

Site-selective and state-specific excitation in conjunction with theoretical predictions of spectroscopic properties will be used to characterize intermediates and transient species that are inaccessible by conventional approaches.  Small molecule activation reactions at metalloenzyme active sites, including proton reduction, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction in hydrogenases and models, will be investigated to demonstrate the utility of this experimental-computational approach and identify key structural motifs during catalysis. This synergistic methodology will be broadly applicable to the study of many classes of enzymes, particularly those containing multiple metallocofactors, such as nitrogenase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.

While structure is clearly related to function, Professors Franzen and Ghiladi are investigating whether structure uniquely defines function. Research on DHP suggests that structure does not uniquely define function, at least within the scope of the heme protein function. DHP was initially identified as a dual function protein capable of both oxygen transport and the enzymatic dehalogenation of halophenols as a natural function. DHP has been recently shown to also possess peroxygenase, oxidase, and oxygenase activities. TDHP represents an ideal platform for testing whether the structure-function paradigm too closely associates protein structure with a single function. It may be revealed that the classic view of protein structure may be too narrow to capture all functions a protein may possess. The focus of the research is a combined structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic (kinetics) study that elucidates the specific set of substrate/inhibitor interactions and dynamics changes for each of the four known functions of DHP."

Bioenergy transduction, a type of energy transport in which the form of the energy also changes, is one of the most fascinating aspects of life.  Biomolecular motors and pumps transduce energy from one form to the other with remarkable efficiency. The study of energy transduction in biomolecular ion pumps involves developing quantum mechanical and classical models that properly describe the energetics and efficiency of ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein. The problem of macromolecular assembly, which underlies many fascinating biological processes such as the formation of muscle fiber, requires the development of effective coarse-grained models that strike the balance of computational efficiency and biophysical specificity. The project offers research opportunities for students at all levels who wish to work at the intersection of chemistry, biology and engineering.  Dr. Cui is actively engaged with programs aimed at broadening participation in physical and biological science by members of under-represented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>For the problem of ion pumping, by adopting the minimum free energy path approach and a multi-layer Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QMMM) model, Cui and co-workers can significantly improve the accuracy and sampling for the study of long-range proton transfers in complex biomolecules compared to previous efforts. By adopting the chemical potential equalization scheme to represent the polarization of different QM regions, they can properly describe ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein that is rich in polar and charged motifs. This computational framework represents the first attempt to include the membrane potential in QM/MM type of simulations. For the problem of coiled-coil assembly, which describes a broad class of problems in which the proper assembly of biomolecules relies critically on a limited degree of flexibility in their structures, their proposed multipolar coarse-grained model makes a natural connection between atomistic and coarse-grained representations with a transparent framework for parameterization. Compared to continuum mechanics models, this model can access similar length and time scales but can be efficiently studied using standard molecular simulation software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ciszek of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago studies the surface chemistry of the prototypical organic semiconductors: tetracene and pentacene.  Because these materials bear little resemblance to classical surfaces, the rules governing their reactivity require entirely new reaction mechanisms which are examined herein.  The results from these experiments allow us to improve the performance of these materials in next generation devices including the light emitting diodes and transistors found in small displays (e.g. smartphone screens).  This grant also supports their Emerging Scientists Workshop, which immerses high school students in experiments found in host laboratories.  This heavily subscribed program is also evaluated as part of the grant, and is expanded as a pilot at DePaul University.<br/><br/>More specific to the science, this project looks at three areas, which highlight differences between chemistry at traditional inorganic substrates and the surfaces of molecular crystals.  The first two center on the fact that geometric considerations (based off molecular orientation in the crystal) appears to be the primary determinant of reactivity.  In part one, the idea of a surface cavity, where surrounding molecules envelop the reactive loci, is developed to explain the reactivity differences between the faces of tetracene and pentacene crystals.  Coverage is assessed over time via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Part two examines how the reaction cavity is also responsible for inhibition of the most reactive bonds in the semiconductor.  This manifests itself in different regioisomers formed on the various surfaces of tetracene and pentacene crystals.  Both substrate and adsorbate parameters (electronic, steric, and phase) are examined for their impact on regioisomer formation.  The final portion of the project examines how adsorbate behavior is impacted by the very low energy surface of the crystal.  With surface energies less than a tenth of metallic surfaces, the coverage and residence time of the adsorbates are expected to be much lower on pentacene and tetracene.  Quartz crystal microbalance studies in conjunction with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy allow reaction kinetics to be corroborated with adsorbate coverage for further mechanistic refinement."

The immediate goal is to model how motion of charged particles (electrons and ions) at gas-metal interfaces can alter the physical and chemical makeup of the metal. These interfaces are of significant technological importance because of their use in platinum-based catalytic converters that are in every automobile. In addition, the new methods can be used to study how heat is transferred out of metallic nanoparticles (spheres of metal smaller than a millionth of an inch across). These particles have been proposed for use in photothermal therapies for cancer, but exactly how heat moves through the molecules that coat the surface of the particles is not yet understood.<br/><br/>The engines driving this effort are new computational algorithms for investigating coupled charge and energy transport properties (e.g. thermoelectric properties and electron-phonon effects). The new methods allow simulating electrical current densities in computer models of molecular motion using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, as well as novel potential energy functions for metals that feature multiple oxidation states and fluctuating valence densities, and new methods to understand ion screening in complex fluids.  An integral part of this effort (and part of its broader impact) will be the release of all of the algorithms and software to the public and other researchers under a permissive open source license.

Lipids are a diverse group of molecules with a variety of biological functions.  In addition to serving as the structural components of cell membranes and energy storage units in plants and animals, many lipids and lipid-containing compounds possess important biological activities and play significant roles in the development of various human diseases.  Therefore, the ability to detect specific types of lipids provides a method to detect the diseases and in some cases treat them.  Towards this long term goal, Prof.  Glass conducts fundamental studies to gain a better understanding of the interactions between lipids and synthetic receptors.  His research aims to provide guiding principles for designing organic molecules that recognize and bind specific types of lipids, signal their presence, and extract them from a membrane in which the lipid molecules are embedded in.  This interdisciplinary project provides an excellent platform for research training of graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, Prof. Glass promotes science to the general public by developing content for a summer program to be held at the University of Missouri for high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>The first lipid targeted in these studies belongs to a class of oxidized phospholipid that has been shown to be important in the development of atherosclerosis. The second class of lipids, called glycolipids, are found on many cell surfaces and are involved in various processes such as cancer and inflammation.  The molecular sensor is composed of a large hydrophobic cleft (for binding the hydrophobic tail of the target lipid and signal transduction) with some type of head-group binding functionality (for recognition of the head group of the target).  For the oxidized phospholipid sensors, a hydrazine is used to bind to an aldehyde of the oxidized lipid providing selectivity for just this type of lipid. For the glycolipids, a boronic acid-based binding group is used to provide selectivity for sugar-containing lipids.  The head-group binding moiety is anticipated to be a sufficient ""hook"" to allow the receptor to extract the target lipid from the membrane in which it is embedded.  The hydrophobic cleft then wraps around the lipid tail.  The binding of the lipid target to the molecular sensor is expected to result in change in fluorescence emission intensity, signaling the presence of the target."

Nanoparticles are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes. The aim of the research is to understand the unusual electrochemical reactivity of metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm and of alloy nanostructure composition, arrangement, and reactivity. The aim is to develop new analytical tools for metal nanostructures, and also uncover unique properties, reactivity, and applications. The project impacts the education of students at all levels through research training and wider incorporation of nanotechnology into the undergraduate curriculum. A yearly one-day symposium highlights research by women of all ages from middle school up to academic and industrial professionals. The goal of this symposium is to inspire more young female students to pursue a long term career in science. These activities impact the education and economy in Kentucky and beyond through broad dissemination. <br/><br/>This project aims to correlate the specific size with the oxidation potential for nanospheres below 2 nm, which show unusual electrochemical reactivity that change dramatically as a function of size. The project also addresses the atomic arrangement of metals in two-component alloy nanospheres by determining electrochemical oxidation behavior. This method allows the sensitive detection of transformations that occur during heating or catalytic reactions. Another focus of the project is the size-selective electrochemical deposition of negatively-charged gold nanospheres onto electrodes. This process has potential for the design of highly active supported electrocatalysts. The research team also uses gold nanoplate-nanosphere dimer structures as a platform for sensitive molecular detection by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Images of the structures are directly correlated to the SERS signal. A unique trimer structure is used to study catalytic reactions on non-SERS active metals.

The Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research also contributes to this award.  Traditional states of matter, such as solids, liquids, and gases, self-organize  through interactions among constituent molecules. Active matter, on the other hand, arises from external energy-driven self-assembly.  Such systems are challenging to model due to the strong intrinsic coupling of chemistry and mechanics.  Active matter has emerged as a new frontier in science, at the interface of chemistry, materials physics, and biology.  In fact, the cells in one's body can be viewed as a form of highly complex active matter, where the external energy is derived from food.  Within each cell, an elaborate interplay of interacting molecular motors, self-assembling filaments, the cell membrane, and organelles continuously convert chemical energy into forces that determine cellular shape, motility, and sensing of the extracellular environment.  Papoian's group, by developing and applying the MEDYAN software framework, is working toward the grand challenge of modeling individual cells in all of their extraordinary complexity, by incorporating new models of the cell's constituent chemical, mechanical, and transport processes.  MEDYAN is thus enabling critical new understanding of the molecular principles underlying cellular active matter.  As part of this project, MEDYAN is being used to study self-assembly and structural stability of dendritic spines in neurons, which support formation of long-term memories in the brain, and cell shape oscillations, whose origin and biological role are not well understood.  The software has applications to biomaterials as well as to cell biology and is expected to advance the national health. MEDYAN is being made available to the public as open source software, and an active matter community website and learning resource is being developed as part of the project.  Research is coupled with education and outreach through inclusion of high school students in lab research, and ongoing efforts to expand diversity in applicants within the university's chemical physics program.<br/><br/>This project is extending MEDYAN to support essential components of eukaryotic cell modeling.  These include a deformable, chemically-active plasma membrane model expressed in terms of a 2D mesh and associated Voronoi polygons; incorporation of a free energy penalty for in-plane and out-of-plane membrane deformations; steric and tethering interactions of cytoskeletal filaments with local membrane patches; volumetric forces due to osmotic pressure or associated with the volume conservation; and reaction-diffusion of membrane bound proteins, including the ability of some proteins to induce spontaneous membrane curvature. These advances are further leveraged to formulate computational models for internal organelles such as the cell nucleus. In addition, a model is being constructed to describe self-assembly of spectrin proteins into a dynamically rearranging 2D sheet transiently tethered underneath the plasma membrane. To achieve the computational efficiency needed for simulating at biologically-relevant length- and timescales, MEDYAN is being parallelized on state-of-the-art CPU and GPU architectures. These new modeling and simulation capabilities are being used to study two important problems in cell biology: the molecular underpinnings of the structural stability of dendritic spines, which underlie the stability of long-term memories in animals; and collective oscillatory cycles, propagating as a migrating front from one cell to another, which are based on a cytoskeletal phenomenon called pulsatility. For both of these projects, there is close collaboration with an experimentalist on iterative model development and validation.  This next generation of MEDYAN is providing important new modeling capabilities with applications to programmable matter integrating active and non-active components to achieve smart materials with unique properties. The MEDYAN software and documentation are freely disseminated as open source.

The Odom group is exploring multicomponent coupling catalysis as a means of lowering the time and energy required to access more complex chemical products in greater yield.  Their method focuses on the use of early transition metals like titanium and zirconium, which are earth-abundant and offer unique chemical products. By understanding and systematizing the factors that control the reactivity of these catalysts, the time and effort required for catalyst optimization is minimized.  Catalyst optimization is explored in systems that show promise for a multicomponent, one-pot method of generating a variety of different important heterocyclic cores commonly employed in pharmaceuticals.

The new parameter measured by spin saturation transfer in the 1H NMR spectra has been dubbed the Ligand Donor Parameter (LDP). In preliminary studies, the ligand descriptor LDP has been applied to titanium-catalyzed hydroamination of alkynes with primary amines. The effect of the ancillary ligands on the titanium catalysis can be effectively modeled using LDP for the electronic component and percent buried volume for the steric descriptor. The method allows the prediction of reaction rates prior to catalyst synthesis, the identification of systems that undergo side reactions or catalyst degradation, and, in some cases, the determination of catalytic intermediates. In this research project, the parameters are being expanded to new ligand types.  Additional methods of modeling catalysis involving more diverse ligand types are also being explored."

This project focuses on three specific areas:  1) the application of internal functions of ligands to control (via secondary weak interactions) the self-assembly process, including self-sorting and the control of stoichiometry and stereochemistry of cage complexes; 2) post-assembly modifications of internal functional groups to alter reactivity and to allow controlled, reversible structural switching between different polyhedral geometries and trapping of cage complexes; and 3) the application of these complexes as biomimetic catalysts in tandem, orthogonal catalysis. An important objective in this area is to demonstrate that the sequestration of acidic and basic functions in cage interiors allows normally incompatible reactions to be performed in a single pot."

The goal of this research is to prepare similar encapsulation devices (micelles) that are made from plastics and are capable of protecting their pharmaceutical drug ""cargoes"" until they reach their destination in the human body.  This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division. Professors Marcetta Y. Darensbourg and Donald J. Darensbourg of Texas A&M University are preparing the plastic micelles from the abundant gas, carbon dioxide. Since the micelles are biodegradable, they fall apart in living organisms and slowly release their drug cargo. One of the specific systems to be investigated involves entrapping nitric oxide (NO)-releasing drugs. Nitric oxide is implicated in vasoregulation and immune function. The broader impact of this work is to heighten students' awareness of the roles chemists play in issues of societal importance, like medicine. Professor Marcetta Darensbourg and her group are leaders in programs such as Women in Science and Engineering, Broadening Horizons for 6th Grade Girls, and the Chemistry Olympiad.  These activities reach out to school children in the Bryan/College Station communities. Professor Donald Darensbourg focuses on carbon dioxide utilization and its impacts on carbon management. He develops courses and education materials on Green Chemistry for advanced undergraduates in chemistry and chemical engineering.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the preparation of triblock, ""ABA"", polycarbonates that, on addition of water, self-assemble into micelles as the A blocks are hydrophilic and the B blocks are hydrophobic. The hydrophobic interiors of the micelles are loaded with molecular payloads of pharmaceutical potential, binding either by non-covalent van der Waals interactions or by covalent attachment. Syntheses and full characterization of the polymers are conducted. The protection of reactive NO-release drugs within the hydrophobic region of a biodegradable micelle may tune and control NO delivery in biological/pharmaceutical applications. Chemical assays and cell studies (cytotoxicity and cell uptake) test this assumption and compare dinitrosyl iron complexes of NO release ability in solution and imbedded within the micelles. Further, the synthesis of polymer immobilized diiron complexes, linked by cyanide to metallo-porphyrin photosensitizers are oriented towards development as hydrogen production catalysts, initially in the absence of water. The research team looks for the stabilization of the fragile diiron or nickel-iron complexes by attachment to (organic solvent) soluble polymers, generating base metal, organometallic catalysts protected from oxygen degradation and aggregation."

Professor Chen is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. He is developing new methods of chemical catalysis for the synthesis of new types of plastics (polymers).  These new plastics are renewable, meaning that they are prepared from grown feedstocks, and thus are sustainable.   The second feature of these new polymers is that they have regular and well-controlled (stereoregular) chemical structures.  Plastics with these characteristics have better physical properties for many applications. These two properties, stereoregularity and renewability, are important for new applications of plastics in the modern economy. The proposed research encompasses diverse areas of chemistry, materials science, and sustainability, thereby providing an excellent opportunity for training and teaching of students, including underrepresented minorities and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The proposed study addresses three currently unmet challenges still facing both the metal catalyzed and organocatalyzed polymerizations of acrylic monomers. First, existing chiral metal catalysts show high stereoselectivity in the polymerization of linear, petroleum-based acrylics but lack of stereochemical control over the polymerization of biomass-derived compact cyclic acrylics. Hence, the first specific objective of the work is to design advanced chiral transition-metal catalysts, assisted by theory, to enable stereoselective polymerization of such challenging bio-derived cyclic acrylic monomers. Second, the recently developed organocatalyzed proton-transfer polymerization can convert diacrylics uniquely into biodegradable unsaturated polyesters, but the current polyester product is an amorphous non-crystalline material, thus limiting its application. Accordingly, the second specific objective of the work is to develop the stereoselective proton-transfer polymerization for the synthesis of stereoregular crystalline unsaturated polyesters. Third, the current organocatalytic conjugate-addition polymerization of acrylic monomers produces only achiral acrylic polymers. Thus, the third specific objective of the work is to establish asymmetric organopolymerization of acrylic monomers to produce optically active chiral polymers. The education plan includes training and teaching of a diverse study body with complementary experimental and computational methods employed in this catalytic chemistry research, as well as for educating students and the general public about the central role of chemistry in addressing the global sustainability challenges."

For example, polymers and inorganic nanoparticles, once considered separate topics, are blended in this work to make ""hybrid structures"", each component interacting with the other to produce striking effects.  Professor Emrick's group synthesizes polymers (""soft materials"") that markedly influence the surface electronic properties of metals (i.e., ""hard materials"") onto which they are coated.  This ability of soft materials to dramatically change the properties of the materials they contact has profound implications for improving the efficiency of numerous devices, including solar cells that collect charge and generate power more efficiently than conventional structures.

The dipole-inducing groups fixed pendent to the polymer chains include zwitterionic substituents (hydrophilic dipoles), with preliminary results describing the impact of conjugated polymer zwitterions on metals, producing polymer solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the effect of the polymers on high work function metal electrodes.  These results translate to functionalized 2-D nanostructures, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), ultimately seeking polymer chemistry-enabled device enhancement.  New synthetic zwitterionic polymers will delineate the effect of the pendent zwitterionic groups on underlying substrates, as distinct from polymer backbone characteristics, by comparing aromatic and aliphatic polymers having zwitterionic pendent groups.

Professor John Poutsma employs mass spectrometry-based experiments to study the subtle interplay between the structure of peptides and their gas-phase energetic properties. He studies peptides containing non-protein amino acids (NPAA), which are found naturally in plants and fungi, but are not used in natural protein synthesis. Many NPAAs are toxic to humans and other animals in part due to structural similarity to one or more of the twenty common protein amino acids (PAA). NPAAs can compete with PAAs in a variety of biological pathways including being mis-incorporated into proteins and peptides. Studying the behavior of peptides into which NPAAs have been systematically substituted helps to understand the relationship between a peptide's structure and its behavior in the mass spectrometer. Ultimately this enhanced understanding may lead to improved automated peptide sequencing algorithms for proteomics experiments. Professor Jennifer Poutsma performs density functional theory calculations to predict structure and energetics that support and guide the experimental studies. Both research programs integrate research and educational components through the training of undergraduate researchers.  This research is carried out by undergraduates at William and Mary and Old Dominion University. Performing independent research helps to teach these students not only the joy of discovery but also how to handle and work through the inevitable failures that accompany real-world science.<br/><br/>In this research, intrinsic gas-phase properties of peptides and their fragments are determined using 1) the extended kinetic method, 2) hydrogen deuterium exchange, 3) infrared multiphoton dissociation spectroscopy, 4) peptide fragmentation studies and 5) density functional computations.

The molecules interact in solution to form aggregates and order in the solid state.  Through this aggregation the molecules are able to communicate electronically and generate interesting optical properties.  Such molecules could be applied to improving solar energy harvesting, enabling the construction of flexible color displays, and improving the sensitivity of sensors.

Key to this project is the effort to understand and control aggregation and solid-state order, as Professor Anthony's group has demonstrated with acenes. By exploiting key functionalization strategies, new molecules are being devised that exhibit ambipolar charge transport, minimized charge-carrier anisotropy, and understand how the nature of aggregation (in solution and solid state) impact singlet fission properties.

Currently, flame retardants are assessed with methods such as the Underwriter Laboratory Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances (UL 94) using a bunsen burner, a stopwatch, and a cotton pad.  The UL method is practical, but does not provide a chemical/physical insight into the effectively development of new flame retardants. The approach under development in the labs of Professor Butler and Dr. McCarney evaluates flame retardants by fast recording 2-D x-ray images (i.e. movies) during the burning period.  The resulting movie enables direct visualization of chemical and physical processes, such as particle dissolution, gas bubble generation, the flow of the melting plastic, char-layer development, and micro-cracks in the char layer.  In addition, the x-ray images provide quantitative information for more in-depth performance evaluations of new flame retardant materials relative to traditional tests.

The project is motivated by the fact that the past 20 years have seen a revolution in chemists' ability to make materials on extremely small scales, notably in the form of ""nanocrystals"" (nanometer-sized excerpts of crystalline materials). Realizing the immense technological promise of nanocrystals, however, requires much more control over their composition, shape, structure, and relative arrangements than is currently possible. This project concerns a recently discovered route towards gaining control of this kind: exchanging one set of ions in a nanocrystal with a chemically distinct set of ions, remarkably without altering the nanocrystal's structure. The mechanism, energetics, dynamics, and physical consequences of such ""cation exchange"" are very poorly understood, greatly limiting its precise application. The project uses tools of theory and computation to develop and explore models that shed light on the chemical underpinnings of ion exchange. It further evaluates the consequences of exchange on electronic properties relevant to desirable technological advances.<br/> <br/>Specific activities of this project include (i) construction of models for exploring reaction mechanisms of doping and ion exchange, (ii) development and application of state-of-the-art computational techniques needed to explore the long-time behaviors of these models, and (iii) the assessment of resulting electronic properties. Interaction models are built through judicious comparison with electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with techniques such as transition path sampling are employed to examine how impurities/cations enter the nanocrystal from solution, how they diffuse through the host lattice, and how they exchange places with host atoms. In order to calculate emergent electronic properties, semiempirical pseudopotential models adequate for doped materials and heterostructures are developed. Finally, a theory for heavily doped nanocrystals in the spirit of a ""hydrogenic-like"" model for multiple impurities is being constructed to elucidate at a fundamental level the alignment of bands, localization of excitons, electron-hole interactions, and how these properties depend on the size, shape, and choice of materials."

Catalysts are compounds that accelerate and direct reactions toward desirable products without themselves being consumed.   Many catalysts contain a metal atom and surrounding organic compounds bound to it, called ligands, and in most catalysts the reaction chemistry occurs on the metal atom.  Professor Brown is studying ways in which to make the ligand participate in the catalysis along with the metal atom or to perform all of the catalysis itself. The structural features of the catalysts and the mechanisms through which the chemical bonds are made or broken are being studied, and this information is being used to design new ligands that should perform better catalysis.  Because catalysis accounts for processes that total one third of the global gross domestic product and a majority of the commercial chemical products and chemical processes, the discovery of new or improved catalysts for organic reactions can have a great impact on economic development and growth.  The research team investigating these issues includes high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students, with the aim of developing their technical and intellectual skills to prepare them appropriately for further training and careers in science or engineering.<br/><br/>Professor Brown is preparing new multidentate redox-active ligands to create environments where ""nonclassical"" redox reactions can take place.  One target is oxygen atom transfer or dioxygen activation in which bonds to oxygen will be formed at the metal center, but redox events will take place at the ligands.  A key design element is the use of high coordination numbers, which may stabilize small bite angle intermediates such as peroxo complexes and allow the assembly of enough ligands around the metal to marshal up to four electrons at a single site.  A second class of reactions being explored is based on concerted, purely ligand-centered 1,2-dehydrogenations of substrates.  These can be carried out even by coordinatively saturated metal complexes, which may lead to greater catalyst lifetimes.  The scope of such reactions, and the possibility that orbital symmetry constraints will steer the selectivity of such reactions, are being explored.  Novel catalysis mechanisms often open up new selectivity pathways, and understanding what electronic and structural features make the reactions more efficient may lead to improved catalysts with impact in the use or production of chemicals and chemical fuels.  A series of educational materials are being developed to help bring introductory students up to speed on practical approaches to chemical kinetics, allowing students to be intellectually engaged with the work at an early stage in their studies."

The forces of nature embodied in thermodynamics dictate that bare nanoparticles are intrinsically unstable; they will inevitably merge (coarsen), becoming larger (and fewer) under normal conditions. Eventually they will lose the properties inherent to smallness. And that can be detrimental, since the properties of nanoparticles are exploited in numerous technologies. Drs. Thiel and Evans are investigating a major, and largely unexplored, aspect of the coarsening process, namely, the nature of the species that shuttle material back and forth between nanoparticles, allowing them to change size. This is a challenging task, but Dr. Thiel is gaining deep and surprising new insights by studying model systems of nanoparticles supported on flat surfaces. Her co-PI, James Evans, models these systems computationally, and helps interpret Dr. Thiel's experimental efforts.  Focusing on nanoparticles of Cu, Ag, and Au, which have valuable optical and catalytic properties, Dr. Thiel can directly ""see"" stoichiometric surface complexes that are involved in coarsening. These complexes can be thought of as mobile molecules containing a few atoms from the nanoparticles and a few atoms from the environment. She has discovered, for example, a heart-shaped ""molecule"" containing two copper atoms and three sulfur atoms, which can shuttle copper atoms across a surface. The instrumentation and experimental/theoretical approach involved in this research are complex. Because of this, as well as her supportive mentoring, Dr. Thiel's students have a wide reputation as excellent experimentalists and scientists. They are valued, for instance, in the microelectronics industry and other high-tech environments, where they constitute a part of the human technological infrastructure of the nation.  Dr. Evan's students are also in high demand for their excellent computational modeling skills.<br/><br/>In this research program, Dr. Thiel and Dr. Evans of Iowa State University are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to study the mechanisms and kinetics of coarsening of metallic nanoclusters on surfaces in the presence of chemical additives. The success of nanoscale science and technology is dependent on robustness of such synthesized functional nanostructures, especially in operating environments. Their analysis exploits a closely integrated combination of experimental studies in a controlled ultra-high vacuum environment and predictive system-specific theory/modeling studies. In-situ Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) studies provide key information on the coarsening mechanism (e.g., Ostwald ripening where small clusters disappear, versus Smoluchowski ripening where cluster diffuse and coalesce) and kinetics. mass transport is mediated by additive-metal complexes, where the interaction of metal additives with the surface has the potential to induce restructuring, and the formation of such complexes is of particular interest in these studies. Theoretical studies utilize Density Functional Theory to assess the metal-metal and metal-additive energetics which control the above described behavior. These energies inform statistical mechanical models describing the surface structures and dynamics observed in the STM studies.

The method is termed backscattering interferometry (BSI).  BSI is a simple and inexpensive way of studying chemical reactions, like those used to understand how a drug molecule works, to monitor environmental pollutes, or to diagnose disease from a blood test.  BSI works by placing a sample into a microscale, glass or plastic, liquid-filled chamber that is illuminated by a laser like those used in a grocery store checkout.  When the laser light is reflected back from the chamber it forms a set of alternating bright and dark spots (interference pattern) that are captured by a camera.  These patterns are exquisitely sensitive to chemical or biochemical changes of the solution in the chamber.  Most tools used to measure chemical interactions require the solution to be modified by tagging, labeling, or attachment to the chamber surface, yet in BSI none of these modifications are required to make the measurements.  With support from this grant Professors Bornhop and Flowers are developing and validating the physical model for these ""free-in-solution"" measurements, by showing that the BSI signal originates from property changes in the solution, such as molecular shape (conformation) and the amount of water closely associated with the molecule (hydration).  These properties have not previously been recognized or measured.  The BSI model, termed the Free-solution Response Function (FreeSRF), is being expanded to a wide array of chemical and biochemical interactions (such as protein-to-protein, DNA-to-DNA interactions)to determine if FreeSRF can be used to predict chemical structural changes. Professor Bornhop is working with companies closely to commercialize a benchtop, compressed BSI that will allow more users to apply the developed approach to their own research. The students engaged in the project receive a broad range of scientific training, ranging from the construction and modification of the instrument, to the development and benchmarking of bioassays, to the development and refinement of the FreeSRF models. Professor Bornhop is also actively engaged in K-12 outreach through the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science (VSVS) program and the Tennessee Governors' School program.  <br/><br/>Back-scattering interferometry (BSI) is the refractive index (RI) sensor used in the studies performed under this NSF project.  BSI is a free-solution, label-free technique with sensitivity that rivals fluorescence assays, is compatible with a wide range of analytes, can be used with complex matrices, and is fully quantitative.  Professors Bornhop and Flowers are studying how intrinsic property changes report molecular binding events at unprecedented sensitivities (pM-fM) in complex milieu, even when the individual binding partners are undetectable by BSI.  Having shown that interferometric, free-solution, label-free studies performed on BSI report conformation and hydration changes, two groups are working together to develop a model that provides a theoretical and experimental underpinning for the phenomenon being measured by BSI and other label-free methods. In addition, building on their theory that refines, or redefines, the basis for label-free free-solution RI measurements, the Free-Solution Response Function (FreeSRF), they are expanding investigations to a more diverse set chemical and biochemical interactions, including DNA and RNA hybridization, metal ion-chelator binding, and protein folding.  It is anticipated that the research will impact on how scientists generally think about label-free sensing, going beyond BSI and SPR, leading to the development of new sensing/imaging systems and novel approaches to the analysis of ligand-protein interactions.  A newly developed, highly compensated scattering interferometer (CSI), is being combined with FreeSRF to enable translation of the methodology to a broader scientific community.   This bench-top CSI for mix-and-read free-solution assays enables a wide array of applications and serve as a foundation for an experiment-based curriculum that teaches students how understanding interaction determinations are critical in chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, and medical technology."

It was suggested recently that when illuminated with low intensity ultraviolet-visible light (i.e., from the Sun), small particles of silver and gold known as plasmonic metal nanoparticles can efficiently deposit energy into specific chemical transformations. This is in contrast to conventional, thermally-driven chemical reactions on metals where energy is indiscriminately distributed among every available reaction. In this project, Dr. Suljo Linic of the University of Michigan is developing an understanding of which physical properties govern the energy flow in plasmonic catalysts and how to control these properties. Developing these insights is critical for a targeted design of selective catalysts for specific chemical transformations. Dr. Linic is also engaged in a wide range of educational activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.

He postulates that these structures would allow for complete control over the resonant energy flow at the nanoscale, funneling it efficiently into desired chemical transformations. He is employing a slate of characterization techniques including atomistic characterization of the geometric structure of the nanostructures, analysis of electronic and optical properties of the multicomponent plasmonic materials as well as vibrational and reaction spectroscopies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy-dense chemical fuels have emerged as an important means of storing renewable energy.

Recently, ordered intermetallic materials have attracted significant attention as high performance electrocatalysts in comparison to disordered alloys. However, these materials often require high temperatures to form, making it difficult to control the size and shapes of the particles. Dr. Hall has recently found that various phases of Pd-Bi ordered intermetallics can be synthesized at more moderate temperatures, allowing access to these materials via low temperature colloidal synthesis. Preliminary results indicate that Pd-Bi ordered intermetallics possess unprecedented catalytic activity, and stability for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), suggesting that Bi can modify the properties of Pd, facilitating enhanced catalytic activity. To understand the origin of high catalytic activity, electro-kinetic and in-situ spectroscopic studies are performed, a mechanistic pathway is proposed, and catalyst performance and stability is evaluated. The goal of these studies is to gain understanding of why Pd-Bi intermetallics are excellent catalysts for ORR, and how to grow ordered intermetallic nanoparticles with controlled sizes, shapes, and compositions.

Unfortunately, catalysts that are effective for deoxygenation also often catalyze other, undesired reactions that lead to the loss of carbon.  The ability to design solid materials that specifically remove oxygen from a feedstock is thus a goal of modern catalysis research. In this project, Dr. J.

It is especially important to identify catalysts that are selective for carbon-oxygen bond activation, since cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds generally results in carbon loss and reduced efficiency.

To avail ourselves of this practically inexhaustible source, several important problems in solar energy capture, storage, and distribution need first to be met in order to harness solar radiation to satisfy global energy demand. One promising method is the use of solar energy to drive chemical reactions that produce easily stored fuels.  Carbon dioxide (CO2), the undesirable ""greenhouse gas"" byproduct of burning fossil fuels and other industrial processes, is potentially an abundant, economic feedstock for solar-driven catalysis to produce hydrocarbon fuels.

McNeil of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry to develop catalytic, synthetic procedures to make polymers that conduct electricity with improved structural control. Conductive polymers represent an interesting subset of polymers that are used as the light-harvesting layer in solar cells, the light-emitting layer in diodes (i.e., LEDs), and the charge conducting layer in transistors.  One key advantage of conductive polymers is that they are flexible, and therefore they can be coated onto flexible substrates using simple, high-throughput technologies (e.g., ink-jet printing). Moreover, the starting materials are inexpensive. As a consequence, the conductive polymers market is rapidly growing and expected to reach 1.6 billion dollars in the US by 2017.  The goal of this research is to broaden the types of polymers that can be made, and at the same time, increase the user-friendliness of the preparation procedure. Polymers with variable composition along the polymer chain are prepared. The objective is to improve the robustness and lifetime of polymer-based solar cells.  The project may have a broader impact on the scientific community and the society at large, given that conjugated polymers are widely used for many applications.  During the course of this work, students are trained in organic, inorganic, organometallic and polymer synthesis and characterization, mechanistic organometallic chemistry, solar cell fabrication and testing. Students from historically underrepresented groups are involved in the project through participation in the Michigan Math and Science Scholars Program and the research partnership with Washtenaw Community College.<br/><br/>Gradient sequence conjugated copolymers are prepared and evaluated for use as compatibilizers in solar cells. Polymer composition, length, and sequence are all crucial factors that influence the properties of the polymer.  As a result, each application often requires different polymer structure to be synthesized.  The copolymers are prepared using palladium catalysts following a mechanism known as catalyst-transfer polycondensation (CTP). Current CTP methods, however, have many limitations, including sensitivity to oxygen and moisture and the fact that many functional groups are not tolerated, large monomers are difficult to polymerize, and few electron-deficient monomers have been polymerized.  The aim of this research is to identify chain-growth methods that are functional group tolerant and user-friendly, and to enable polymerization of large monomers containing electron-deficient arenes. Once optimized, the methods are applied to the gradient copolymer synthesis of higher-performing polymers (beyond poly (3-hexylthiophene)) with side chain fullerene for compatibilizing solar cells. The resulting mechanistic insight and catalysis discoveries may interest the synthetic organic, organometallic and polymer chemistry communities."

The ""containers"" act as nanovessels that show robust stability and can be used and re-used over a wide range of conditions. A broader impact of this research is the benefit of developing sustainable chemistry.  Another impact is the discovery of new molecules for use in water-proof coatings and nanomachines.  Postdoctoral researchers benefit from learning how research projects translate from chemical discovery to applications in new materials.<br/><br/>The chemistry of molecules confined to small containers - nanoscale compounds known as cavitands - is a relatively new undertaking. This research takes advantage of an early discovery that long-chain organic compounds assume unusual, folded shapes within the cavitand's space. The folded shapes, induced by hydrophobic forces, push the substrate's ends together and promote large-ring cyclization processes. The cavitands act as templates. Folding also blocks some sites on the chain and exposes others to reactions with agents in the aqueous medium. The blocking action promises new chemical pathways for remote carbon-hydrogen activation in functionalization reactions that typically lead to 5 or 6-membered ring sizes. Functional groups that are remote in extended molecules are brought into proximity when folded in cavitands.

This challenge is to model the dynamics of active materials over experimental time scales.  Conventional computational algorithms allow for simulations of atomic scale systems for very short times: from nanoseconds to microseconds. Such simulations are useful, but they are a million times smaller than the timescale needed to study important systems and processes including catalysis and batteries.  Henkelman and coworkers aim to bridge this so-called ""timescale gap"" through the further development and improvement of a method called adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC). In AKMC, an efficient exploration of the potential energy surface is used to determine reaction rates and reaction mechanisms.  The goal of this project is to overcome the technical and algorithmic challenges related to applying AKMC to the discovery of new catalysts and functional materials.  A significant broader impact of this project is the development, distribution and support of a software tool that is freely available to the entire research community.  This software permits scientists to directly model their materials over relevant experimental timescales.<br/><br/>The efficiency of AKMC relies on transition state theory, where the simulation timescale is determined by the rate of the slow chemical transitions of interest rather than the vibrational timescale of atomic vibrations, which is the limitation for molecular dynamics.  While AKMC has been used routinely for model systems based upon empirical potentials - fit to experiment - it needs to be extended to accurate calculations based upon quantum mechanics which can be used to model systems that are relevant to, for example, energy applications. For that, AKMC need to be coupled to standard chemical and materials modeling software, based upon density functional theory, so that the scientists and engineers working to discover new catalysts and improved materials can use this methodology to simulate the timescales of relevance for their applications. <br/><br/>A limitation of AKMC and an ongoing challenge that is addressed in this project is the problem of low barriers. An explicit treatment of the state-to-state kinetics can require an intractable number of KMC transitions over low barriers between the higher barrier events of interest. A strategy for overcoming the low barrier problem is to use an analytic solution of the master equation such as the Monte Carlo with adsorbing Markov chains method. In large and disordered systems, however, the number of states connected by low barriers (superbasin states) grows exponentially with system size. Not only is this a problem for the efficient solving of the rate equations, large global superbasins need to be reconstructed whenever an AKMC step alters the superbasin structure. A localization algorithm is being implemented to avoid the combinatorial increase of superbasin states. Development also focuses on a method to automatically build reaction networks of catalytic systems. Specifically, Cu oxidation and catalytic CO oxidation is being modeled on supported metal alloy nanoparticles. The intrinsic activity of these nanoparticles can be a result of direct and dynamic participation of the nanoparticle and support atoms in the reaction mechanisms. In this project, stable states are defined by a clustering algorithm of reactive events from long time scale trajectories. In this way, long time scale dynamics may be used to determine reactivity descriptors for complex catalytic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often catalysts are based on precious elements that are rare and expensive such as platinum and rhodium. In contrast, biological catalysts or enzymes, often use abundant and inexpensive elements such as iron and copper to carry out important physiological reactions. Professor Abu-Omar is drawing inspiration from biology to develop and study catalysts based on manganese and iron, earth-abundant elements, for chemical reactions that are important for energy and the environment: making hydrogen peroxide directly from air, decomposing an environmental contaminant made up of chlorine and oxygen atoms into harmless table salt and oxygen, and also converting this contaminant into a disinfectant on-demand in water and at room temperature. <br/><br/><br/>Professor Abu-Omar is developing high-valent oxo complexes of first row transition metals, specifically manganese and iron, supported by corrole, prophyrin, and pyridyl or amidato macrocylic ligands.  Some of these complexes are being used to study the kinetics and mechanism of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) in manganese(V)-oxo corrole to establish a catalytic system for the selective two-electron reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Generation of hydrogen peroxide directly from air would provide greener methods for making this important industrial chemical and contribute to strategies for renewable energy conversion and storage.  Others of these complexes are being used to study the reaction chemistry of the oxyanion, chlorite.

Nanoparticles are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes.  Professor Yarmoff uses specialized characterization methods to investigate how the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles are affected by defects in a solid support material.  Measurements are made as a function of nanoparticle size, the number of intentionally produced defects in the support material and exposure to gases that ""stick"" (or adsorb) to the clusters. The research has significant broader impact in the field of surface chemistry. Learning how to control the electronic properties of nanoparticle will facilitate their use in numerous applications such as electronics, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar power generation and catalysis. This research project impacts knowledge in basic science, technology and the environment while directly contributing to the education of the university's diverse student body. Graduate and undergraduate students obtain hands-on laboratory experience in a field that is at the forefront of modern research, while local high school teachers benefit from a summer program that includes laboratory experience. <br/><br/>In this project professor Yarmoff studies how the local electrostatic potential (LEP) of supported metal nanoclusters is affected by (1) the intentional introduction of defects in the substrate, (2) adsorption of various adatoms onto the nanoclusters, and (3) the manner in which defects in the substrate act to modify any subsequent adsorption. Although there has been a proliferation of research on metal nanoclusters, there are still many unanswered questions and no consensus as to the underlying mechanisms responsible for their catalytic enhancement and other properties. There is a strong body of evidence, however, that the charge state of metal nanoclusters is a critical factor in their electronic and chemical behaviors. Supported metal nanoclusters are produced on oxide and fluoride substrates by direct deposition and buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG).  Professor Yarmoff uses a novel form of low energy ion scattering (LEIS), which relies on the neutralization of scattered 1-5 keV alkali ions, to monitor the surface LEP and charge state of the nanoclusters. Incorporation of intentionally produced defects and adsorption of small molecules are used to tune the amount of charge localized on each cluster. The research has significant broader impact on the field; these studies provide an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of solid-state materials while developing methods to control them, which will facilitate their use in numerous applications such as nanoelectronics, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar power generation and catalysis.

Heat, light (photons), and electrons provide different routes to initiate chemical reactions.  While heat- and photon-driven chemical processes are well studied, electron-driven processes are not well understood, even though electrons are ubiquitous in nature. Electrons are generated by radiation, and their collisions with atoms and molecules are essential in biology and chemistry, as well as in technology. Examples of electron-driven phenomena can be found in interstellar chemistry, radiation chemistry, environmental chemistry, stability of waste repositories, plasma processing of materials for microelectronic devices, and other applications. A major complication in electron-driven processes is that the states that are involved are metastable. Matsika and her research group develop computational and theoretical approaches to treat metastable states and their chemical reactivity. They specifically apply these methods to better understand DNA damage by radiation as well as formation of prebiotic molecules in interstellar medium.  The research is expected to provide valuable insights into the understanding of important electron-driven phenomena in many areas of chemistry, specifically biological systems and formation of prebiotic molecules. This research is carried out by a research team involving collaboration of undergraduate and graduate students with postdoctoral associates. The involvement of high school students in research activities  inspires students to be involved in science.

The complex absorbing potential approach is used in combination with multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) to obtain both the energies and lifetimes of these states.  The performance of the complex absorbing potential method (CAP) is compared with that of orbital stabilization methods for medium sized molecules in combination with various electronic structure methods. Gradients and nonadiabatic couplings for CAP/MRCI are developed. These methods are used to explore complex potential energy surfaces and conical intersections between complex surfaces.

The University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) has a strong tradition of training students in STEM fields.  This award will allow Professor Coombs to extend hands-on research opportunities to both undergraduate and M.S.-level students interested in conducting original research in preparation for careers in chemical science.  The projects funded in this proposal will be used to teach students how to approach research questions from a molecular perspective and to troubleshoot challenges encountered in the laboratory.<br/><br/>The proposed research is aimed at developing new methods for the enantioselective organocatalytic synthesis of enolizable alpha-amino aldehydes bearing sulfonamide protecting groups.  These protecting groups may be removed under non-reductive conditions, permitting the incorporation of reducible functional groups in the starting aldehydes.  Extending these methods to use tryptamines as reaction substrates for the synthesis of 3-amino-pyrroloindolines via a similar mechanism will also be investigated, as will the development of an enantioselective route to enolizable alpha-azido aldehydes for use in tandem reactions generating nitrogen heterocycles.  The proposed research seeks to develop new enantioselective amination methods for streamlining organic synthesis."

Porphyrins are large-ring heterocycles which possess many valuable properties and have applications in materials science, catalysis and medicine. Porphyrins are widely distributed in nature as catalytic sites in enzymes.  Far less research has been reported on porphyrin-like macrocycles or porphyrinoids even though these systems demonstrate properties that complement those of true porphyrins. This research will lead to more efficient routes to carbaporphyrinoid systems, in which one nitrogen is replaced by carbon, and will also provide access to new classes of porphyrin analogues. These projects will improve our understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts such as aromaticity. The new porphyrinoids may find applications in the preparation of fine chemicals, since metalated derivatives can be used to construct catalysts for chemical synthesis. Broader impacts of this research lie in applications of these new substances and in student training.  The target compounds have potential medicinal applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. These projects provide an excellent environment for training undergraduates and M.S.-level graduate students in the field of organic synthesis.  Students will be exposed to the multidisciplinary nature of modern scientific research.<br/><br/>In this research, synthetic routes to novel carbaporphyrins and related porphyrinoids, including ""neo-confused"" porphyrins, carbachlorins and dicarbaporphyrinoids, will be developed. Further application of the [3 + 1]-variant on the MacDonald reaction will allow the synthesis of porphyrinoids with pyranone, phenalene, pyrene and benz[f]indene units, and these studies will be extended to the preparation of fused carbaporphyrinoid dimers. A new synthetic approach to carbaporphyrinoids will also be developed using carbatripyrrin intermediates. This strategy will allow more direct access to carbaporphyrins, heterocarbaporphyrins and dicarbaporphyrins starting from indene or cyclopentadiene. Carbachlorins have been little studied to date, and new routes to dihydroporphyrinoids will also be developed. Carbachlorins have useful properties in their own right and may also act as precursors to carbaporphyrins. Furthermore, syntheses of adj-dicarbaporphyrins will be investigated using a base catalyzed MacDonald [2 + 2]-approach and attempts will be made to prepare tri- and tetracarbaporphyrinoid systems. The properties of this new collection of macrocycles will be investigated."

Catalytic chemicals can greatly enhance the reaction rates, which allows the reactions to proceed under milder and more controllable conditions, and improves the selectivity to the desired product (fewer by-products). Currently, developing a good catalyst for a specific, desirable reaction is challenging and requires good knowledge of how the reactants and catalyst interact. In this project, Dr. Zhenmeng Peng is researching the key factors that determine reactant-catalyst interactions for transition metals in carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalysis. Dr. Peng's approach is to improve upon an adsorption model for accurate calculation of these interactions from easy to perform measurements.  Knowledge gained in this research helps to significantly accelerate the search for new catalysts. Catalysis plays an essential role in chemical, petrochemical and energy industries, with catalytic materials being widely used for chemical conversions and energy generation, and thus the research has broad societal impact.  Dr. Peng is also actively engaged in a number of outreach activities, aimed at creating early scientific interest in high school students and influencing their career development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.  He is involved in the development of a nanocatalysis learning module for K-12 teachers, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, development of a community learning network course, and diversity outreach efforts with Women in Engineering (WIE) and Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academics (IDEA) programs at the University of Akron.

He is using a multi-approach mechanistic study of carbon monoxide oxidation to test this improvement.  To this aim, Dr. Peng is synthesizing model catalysts with a controlled d-band center and work function parameters and examining their correlations with CO and O2 adsorption.  The research employs Ead of the reacting species to obtain information on the reaction mechanism and other important catalytic properties which are challenging to measure experimentally. Establishing an exact Ead-catalyst parameter relationship allows Dr. Peng to characterize adsorbate and reactive intermediate bonding to the metal substrate, the knowledge of which helps to understand the catalytic mechanism, identify reactive intermediates, and guide catalyst research.  Driven by the hypothesis that implicit inclusion of both covalent and ionic contributions to d-band theory can significantly improve the accuracy of the theory, Dr. Peng relates the metal d-band center and work function to Ead for inclusion of the covalent and ionic fractions, respectively.

As fossil fuels are depleted, chemists have turned their focus to investigating synthetic methods for obtaining alternative energy resources and producing chemicals. A central challenge to developing such sustainable and renewable strategies is the conversion of abundant, yet unreactive, molecules such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen into useful chemicals that meet societal needs.  In Nature, the conversion of these abundant molecules is accomplished by multi-metal assemblies that share and transfer the electrons required to carry out the useful chemical reactions.  Drawing inspiration from these systems, Dr. Matson is investigating the electronic interactions between metal-oxide clusters and transition metals.  The goal of this project is to understand how transition metals work cooperatively to mediate the multi-electron activation of the strong bonds of chemical pollutants. Dr. Matson is actively engaged in a number of outreach activities in Rochester, building upon her previous training as a chemistry teacher.  These events are designed to improve the dissemination of scientific knowledge to young students by increasing exposure through demonstrations and training teachers to be more effective in their communication with students.  <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Matson and her research group are investigating the synthesis and reactivity of a family of iron-functionalized polyoxovandate-alkoxide clusters.

PAH materials are formed upon dehydration of the reaction products, meaning water is the only chemical byproduct. This project lies at the interface of organic, organometallic and materials chemistry and provides a suitable forum for the education of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scientists.

Professor Song Lin is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.  Prof. Lin's lab aims to develop new methods for building organic molecules that contain carbon-nitrogen bonds.  Carbon-nitrogen bonds are critically important. Over 85% of the top-selling pharmaceuticals have at least one carbon-nitrogen bond. With this in mind, the goal of the research being pursued is to establish efficient, selective, and sustainable reaction technologies that will promote the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds from abundant starting materials.  Electrochemistry, a process that directly uses electricity to drive chemical reactions, is an intrinsically efficient, selective, and sustainable technology. It would appear to be an ideal method for making carbon-nitrogen bonds in a sustainable manner. However, electrochemical reactions frequently do not afford the chemical selectivity and efficiency necessary to accomplish a particular transformation. The introduction of catalysis that can control the chemical reaction portion of the process can solve this problem. In so doing, the catalyst augments the energy efficiency of electrochemical reactions by offering an opportunity to better control the yield and identity of the end product. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis, catalysis, and electrochemistry. Therefore, it is also well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.

Three specific aims are being pursued simultaneously. The scope of the electrocatalytic diazidation of alkenes for the synthesis of vicinal diamines is being investigated, the electrochemical azidooxygenation of alkenes for the synthesis of aminoalcohol products is being advanced, and an electrocatalytic paradigm to decarboxylative and deborylative azidations is being expanded. Additional efforts are studying the mechanisms of the electrochemical reactions using kinetic and voltammetric experiments. Finally, the new reaction methods are being employed to improve the synthesis of bioactive complex targets.  The proposed educational plan is working to expand the nation's infrastructure for STEM education on collegiate and K-12 levels with a particular emphasis on sustainability.

Undergraduate and graduate students conducting this research learn about developing practical methods, including improving reaction conditions through systematic variation of conditions and detailed investigations into fundamental chemical processes.

In addition to the above benefits, the use of a non-electrophilic oxidant, allyl acetate, allows for transformations that tolerate highly oxidation-prone functionality, such as unprotected amines and alcohols, common to bioactive small molecules.  Furthermore, these investigations into palladium-catalyzed processes, akin to the Saegusa oxidation, utilize alpha-hydride elimination to effect diverse carbon-carbon bond forming construction reactions.

Glasses have been used by mankind for millennia.  The first historical record of man-made glasses appears as far back as 4500 years ago and the use of glass in windows began over 2000 years ago. Today the technological and economical impact of glassy materials is both immense and diverse.  Despite its technological success, glass scientists and engineers still often resort to Edisonian approaches in attempts to understand the chemical compositions of glasses with desired properties.  This is because the physical and chemical processes responsible for the properties of glasses and for glass transition are incompletely understood.  Professor Grandinetti and his coworkers aim to achieve significantly higher throughput NMR measurements on such samples by optimally integrating two NMR sensitivity enhancement strategies, echo train acquisition and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. Such high throughput NMR measurements in silicate glasses would considerably expand the range of chemical compositions that could be studied and eliminate the burden and cost of preparing isotopically enriched samples. This would have benefits for scientists studying the physics, chemistry, and materials science properties of glasses. The project will also provides interdisciplinary training opportunities to undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students. The PI's ongoing partnership with scientists at the CEMHTI-CNRS lab in Orleans, France, will provide students the opportunity to collaborate across national boundaries. A partnership between Professor Grandinetti and Berea College will provide undergraduate students with summer research opportunities.<br/><br/>In this multi-tiered project, the Grandinetti group will bring natural abundance Si-29 and O-17 2D NMR measurements of oxide glasses into the realm of routine measurements.

The group will then employ the DAS probe in a suite of complementary 2D NMR measurements to explore a series of thirty binary glass compositions of fundamental interest. In these studies, the Grandinetti lab will quantify the distributions of Si-O distances, Si-O-Si angles, and network-forming anionic species distributions. They will also develop the chemical shift anisotropy of Si-29 and the quadrupolar coupling of O-17 into a qualitative and quantitative probe of network modifier cation clustering, and develop the Si-29 J coupling across a Si-O-Si linkage into a more reliable probe of Si-O-Si angles and network connectivities. Taken together, these studies aim to provide a new level of qualitative and quantitative detail about structural order and disorder in glass.  The structural details of glass to be elucidated through these studies would also benefit scientists seeking to develop thermodynamic models of glasses and melts, and seeking to refine potentials used in molecular dynamics simulations of glasses. Details on modifier cation clustering behavior in glasses will be useful to scientists developing improved structural models of ionic transport, of the mixed alkali effect, and of the microscopic structure of chemically strengthened glass."

In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection of molecules and determination of their structure even when present in a complex mixture.  The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students as well as high school students through a variety of programs such as Engaging New Generations at Georgia Tech through Engineering and Science (ENGAGES), a  program that is directed towards underrepresented students in the Atlanta area. This advanced mass spectrometer serves as a regional resource through collaborations involving multiple institutions such as Emory University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, Georgia State University, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other institutions.<br/><br/>This mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It benefits researchers studying proto-peptide evolving systems: post-translational modifications in large, intact, G-protein coupled receptors and their associated G proteins. The instrumentation is also used in investigations of metabolomics and lipidomics, and in developing 3-dimensional surface analysis tools and applications that may be useful to follow brain changes after traumatic brain injuries. The mass spectrometer benefits research in cell manufacturing, synthetic phage modification, nanoparticle metabolomics, and glycoproteomics. In addition, the instrument is used for research studies of photosynthetic electron transfer, quorum sensing, food-disinfection by-products, protein trafficking, and nanomaterials."

In one set of experiments, Vaccaro and his group will extend their past work on the chiroptical spectroscopy of isolated molecules in the gas phase.  In the next phase of this work, the Vaccaro group will use cavity ringdown polarimetry to probe the electronic circular dichroism and electronic circular dichroism of some fairly complex chiral molecules in the gas phase, including molecules like (R) - norbornenone and the very weakly optically active species cyclopropane-1,2-d2.

The Notre Dame groups also plan to develop the characterization methods needed to pursue the rational design of SWIR tags and apply them to deep-tissue imaging studies.  A comparison of SEHRS and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) shows that SEHRS can be more sensitive than SERS in certain situations. Lastly, they explore the potential for hand-held, field-portable devices capable of recording SEHRS spectra with continuous-wave lasers.

The synthetic methods are designed to carefully, and selectively, control the insertion of metal atoms into fullerenes, where the atom will be stabilized.  Endohedral fullerenes have only been prepared in minute quantities in a gas phase process.  They have already shown promise in medical imaging technology as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (using paramagnetic gadolinium) and X-ray contrast agents (using the strong X-ray absorber lutetium).  The project is focused on the development of new methods for the preparation of endohedral fullerenes in large quantities to facilitate their practical use for such diagnostic medical imaging and other possible technological applications.  Students at college and high school levels are involved in the project and trained in state of the art synthetic and structure characterization techniques.  Several outreach activities, including a chemistry peer mentoring program, and seminar courses, such as "" Symmetry in Art and Science"" and ""Chemicals and their Effect on California History"" are being developed.         <br/>  <br/>In this project, known chemical procedures are used to fashion holes in the fabric of the fullerene cages of C60 and C70 to form open-cage fullerenes.  These open cage structures frequently have Lewis base sites suitable for metal ion bonding near the orifice. Subsequently, metal ions are attached to these open cage fullerenes and eventually inserted into their interior. Reduction of the cage is used to attract the metal ion through the opening and into the interior. These reactions are monitored by spectroscopic means and the products, including metal ion complexes of the open cage fullerenes with metal ions on the outside and on the inside, are isolated and structurally characterized, particularly by single crystal X-ray diffraction.  Once the metal center enters the cage, chemical reactions are used to begin to close the hole in the fullerene network.  Physical properties, such as ability to function as MRI contrast agents and X-ray contrast agents, of the new endohedral species will be examined. The project is also designed to examine two new synthetic routes to make macroscopic amounts of metallo-heterofullerenes, carbon cages with some of the carbon atoms replaced with metal atoms.

This enzyme is molecule important for the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) in methanogens, which are single cell microorganisms that can be found for example in the human gut and in wetlands. These organisms are very efficient at transforming dihydrogen (H2) and CO2 from the environment in which they live into methane.  In contrast, artificial way to capture and transform H2 and CO2 are much less efficient. Furthermore while the enzymes, in particular mono-iron hydrogenase, utilize earth abundant metals like iron and nickel, many synthetic analogues of the enzymes utilize precious metals like platinum, iridium or palladium. The research of Professor Rose focuses on understanding how the mono-iron hydrogenase catalyzes the chemical transformation in the methanogens and applying this understanding to developing artificial catalysts as efficient as the enzyme. Professor Rose also participates in the outreach program called H2fromH2O. He interacts with high school students in the central Texas region to demonstrate the fundamental science, environmental impact and possible applications for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and derive energy from this process. The students who participate in the outreach program further disseminate such lessons to their families and communities.  This serves to raise awareness about the importance of developing renewable energy technologies. UT Austin undergraduates directly participate in the outreach efforts, become motivate to do research, and pursue job opportunities and graduate education in energy-related fields.<br/><br/>The available, iron-based synthetic (artificial) systems of a molecular nature do not replicate the speed and efficiency of the naturally occurring system.

First, synthetic model complexes are hybridized with protein hosts to determine the effect of the protein environment on the spectroscopic properties and functional reactivity of the model complexes (versus stand-alone metal complexes). Second, the ""anthracene scaffold"" strategy for assembling the biomimetic fac-CNS motif is modified with more flexible ""anthranoid"" scaffolds to investigate the role of protein-like flexibility of the donor arms on the reactivity of the model complexes.

Molecular rings are found in many compounds that possess significant biological activity and are potentially applicable to human health. Examples include colchicine, used in the treatment of gout, and the experimental resiniferatoxin, a lead compound in the treatment of pain. Molecular rings are also of interest in the development of new materials. In addition to synthesizing these compounds, Dr. Harmata is investigating the how the reactions progress. Certain molecules have a 3-dimentional structure that makes them non-superimposable on their mirror image, just as right and left hands are not superimposable on each other. Dr. Harmata is developing methods to control which mirror image product is formed. Because the different mirror image forms of a molecule can have very different biological activity, the methods Dr. Harmata developed have broad, general significance. Dr. Harmata is also engaged in activities directed towards younger chemists and the general public. He organizes a symposium called Organic Chemistry Day to bring chemists from Missouri and neighboring states together to talk about organic chemistry frontier.  Dr. Harmata also speaks at a program at the University of Missouri called Saturday Morning Science. These outreach activities enable him not only to teach organic chemistry, but to explain how research is done and how it serves the general public, sometimes to children as young as six or seven years old. Last but not the least, Dr. Harmata sponsors a summer program for underrepresented high school students to work in his lab. <br/><br/>Dr. Harmata is studying two unique (4+3)-cycloaddition reactions. The first synthetic scheme is an asymmetric, catalytic process. Expanding the scope of this process beyond cyclopentenyl oxyallylic cations that are currently being used and understanding the origins of the high enantiocontrol observed are being investigated both experimentally and computationally. The second area makes use of developing oxidopyridinium ions as dienophiles in (4+3)-cycloadditions. This research is being pursued at the most fundamental levels, developing tools for simple stereoselection as well as the control of diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. For all of the reactions mentioned, the investigations include both intermolecular and intramolecular prospects. Finally, unique aspects of these reactions are being studied.

Immunoassays offer a powerful approach to quantitating a variety of biological substances such as proteins, peptides, antibodies, and hormones, etc., in complex mixtures such as blood, saliva and sweat.  Immunoassays are based on antigen-antibody interactions and as such, are very specific, capable of measuring very low concentrations.  Professors Debashis Dutta and Michael Taylor of the University of Wyoming (UW) are developing electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassays. The limits of measurement with this technique are over 1000-10,000 times lower than those using the current Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA). The development of even more rapid processes and new antigen-antibody interactions are central to this research.  Education efforts include constructing a portable ECL instrument for use in the undergraduate classroom as well as developing a laboratory module for the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at UW. The team also continues to develop an outreach program with the Central Wyoming College (CWC). CWC enrolls significant numbers of Native Americans and first generation college students.  The outreach activities with CWC include presentations on micro-/nanoscale analytical devices to the Science, Math and Engineering Club at CWC, as well as intensive on-site demonstrations of nanotechnology for the interested club member.  These activities encourage the students to pursue careers in biotech and biomedical fields. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the capture of antigen molecules on an electrode surface using a steady or a pulsating electric field.

The project lies at the interface of physical organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.

These findings provide an opportunity to transport charges to desired locations without a loss in Gibbs free energy.  Particular focus wiis being given to address the following fundamental questions: How can molecular structure be tuned to control intermolecular electron transfer?  Is there a correlation between self-exchange reactions in fluid solution and those on oxide surfaces?  Does self-exchange electron transfer between dyes influenced unwanted recombination reactions?  Can self-exchange with molecules that contain two (or more) redox active groups be controlled by the bridge that links them?  A kinetic approach that enables redox equilibria at the adiabatic/non-adiabatic border to be quantified for the first time is being utilized.

They cannot resolve two objects that are closer to each other than the wavelength of light, which for visible colors is about 500 nm, or about 1/100 the diameter of a human hair. Recently super-resolution microscopes have been developed that can resolve individual molecules that are only 10 nm apart. Super-resolution microscopy has had tremendous success when imaging fluorescent dyes near other molecules, such as proteins, but it has trouble when the molecule is located near a metal nanostructure. The problem arises when the molecule interacts with the loosely held electrons in the metal, which blurs its location. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Willets at Temple University is studying the interaction of fluorescent molecules with metal nanoparticles. Professor Willets and her students are developing protocols that can better pinpoint the location of the fluorescent molecule.  The project could pave the way to producing higher fidelity super-resolution images, which may help to advance nanotechnologies for biosensing, nanomedicine, and solar energy conversion. The work also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, furthering the development of the Nation's scientific workforce. In addition, the Willets lab is actively engaged with the 9th grade science classes at Freire Charter School in downtown Philadelphia, helping the students to foster an appreciation for scientific exploration and discovery.<br/><br/>Working alongside her students, Professor Willets is functionalizing gold nanorods and nanospheres at specific sites with fluorescently-labeled DNA.   A combination of super-resolution imaging and polarization-resolved microscopy is then used to track how the position and orientation of the fluorescent molecules impacts the localization precision of the fluorescent molecule.  In super-resolution imaging, single fluorescent molecules are localized by fitting their diffraction-limited emission to a model function, such as a two-dimensional Gaussian, to localize their spatial position with better than 10 nm precision.  However, coupling between the fluorescent emitter and the plasmon modes of the nanostructure impacts the localization accuracy, resulting in the calculated position of the fluorescent molecule being shifted from its true position.  Theoretical modeling provides insight into how the position and orientation of a single molecule relative to the plasmonic nanostructure affects the localization error.  By creating well-defined hybrid organic-plasmonic nanoparticles, the team is developing new analysis tools to extract information hidden in the fluorescence images to improve agreement between the super-resolved images and the actual nanostructure properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA acts as a scaffold that precisely controls the positions of individual silver ions.  When another chemical reagent is added to provide electrons to the Ag+ ions, the array of Ag+ ions in the DNA become small clusters containing no more than a few dozen metal atoms. These miniscule clusters have remarkable optical properties, including for example fluorescence. Fluorescence is a process by which a molecule absorbs light at one wavelength and shortly afterwards emits light of another color.  This is a property that macroscopic silver objects do not possess. Their fluorescence properties makes these silver clusters attractive for sensing and imaging applications. However, despite widespread interest in these clusters, very little is known about what controls their light emission. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Bern Kohler of The Ohio State University and students working under his direction are investigating DNA-metal assemblies that are excited by short laser pulses (a few hundred femtoseconds, where a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of one second).   The Kohler team observes how the color of the light emitted from the silver clusters depends on the color and time interval of the impinging laser pulse.  Under some conditions, no light is emitted at all.  These studies are revealing the mysteries of how light energy is absorbed by small metal clusters, and either emitted again as light or dissipated into the clusters' surroundings. The undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project are gaining experience in state-of the-art laser techniques, and the kinds of analysis needed to solve problems at the interface of spectroscopy and nanoscience. This multidisciplinary training is important for upholding the nation's workforce of scientists. <br/><br/>This project targets fundamental understanding of excited electronic states formed by UV and visible excitation of DNA-metal complexes and nanostructures. Silver ions coordinate to the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the nucleobases, giving rise to metal-mediated base pairs and a rich variety of self-assembled structures. Reduction of the bound silver ions produces compact metal nanostructures containing small numbers of silver atoms with remarkable, but poorly understood photophysical properties. Using femtosecond spectroscopy, nonradiative and radiative decay pathways are being observed and characterized in mononucleotide-metal ion complexes and their self-assembled nanostructures, and in DNA-hosted silver nanoclusters. Time-domain measurements are employed to develop a comprehensive photophysical model of silver nanoclusters. Fundamental understanding of the electronic interactions between DNA and metals can provide new insights into hybrid organic-inorganic interfaces that are attractive for controlling the separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers and redox equivalents.   The study of few-atom noble metal nanoclusters by ultrafast spectroscopy promises to accelerate societally beneficial advances in science and technology.

To address these problems, Dr. Gadzikwa's lab is co-opting the strategies of enzymes and transferring them onto the solid-state scaffold of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials.

Heterodimetallic Mo-Cu compounds with bridging carbonyl and sulfido ligands are prepared as analogues of intermediates in the catalytic cycle of CODH. This portion of the study first involves an investigation of the of CO binding to two-coordinate Cu(I) bis(thiolate) complexes. This resembles the first step of the CO oxidation pathway in CODH.

In this project, Dr. Samuel Odoh of the University of Nevada Reno is developing and using computational chemistry methods to understand exactly how these catalysts work and how to improve them. The new computational approaches being developed to solve this problem also have applications to other problems in chemistry and catalysis. The techniques and software being developed will be provided to the research community. Dr. Odoh and his group are providing education and research opportunities students from underrepresented groups and low-income families in Northern Nevada. These activities include summer research internships for high school students in Dr. Odoh's laboratory as well as outreach and recruitment drives to the inner-city areas of Reno-Tahoe. These activities are improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at the middle school, high school and college levels.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Odoh of the University of Nevada Reno, is developing fundamental understanding of how the properties of copper-exchanged zeolites dictate their activity, turnover rates and selectivity in the oxidation of methane with oxygen to form methanol under mild temperature conditions. A theory-based understanding of the physical and chemical properties of these catalytic platforms can lead to improved predictions of materials with better performance for methane-to-methanol conversion (MMC). The researchers are developing and using new and existing quantum-mechanical methods capable of accurately describing the multireference properties of the metal oxide clusters that are the active sites for MMC. These methods are being used to investigate the nature and identity of the active sites in copper-exchanged zeolites. Dr. Odoh's laboratory is providing greater understanding of MMC and side-reactions in these materials. This work is guiding the design of better catalysts and leading to a pivot in the direction of developing catalysts for MMC. In addition, the computational techniques and software being developed will be provided to the research community for use in attacking other problems in chemistry and catalysis. Dr. Odoh is actively engaged in STEM outreach programs focused on recruiting students from low-income families and under-represented backgrounds. This is being done through high school student research internships, mentoring drives and educator development in support of the broader impacts of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When many polymer chains are aggregated together they form plastics, whose properties depend on the monomer's chemical structure. While some polymers are made to be stiff or flexible, others are designed to absorb light, transport excited state energy (called excitons), and conduct electricity, giving rise to electronic devices that are thin, light, and flexible. While such polymers have been known for some time, designing materials that have the same performance as traditional electronics materials (e.g. silicon) is difficult. The movement of excitons through a polymer involves both motion along a single chain, as well as transfer between chains, and studying this interchain hopping is a challenge.  With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Laura Kaufman at Columbia University is using sophisticated microscopies to study the flow of excitons through polymer aggregates.  The insights gained from the project could help pave the way to inexpensive solar cells and flexible electronics, which would have significant societal benefits.  The project is also providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will enter the Nation's science and technology workforce, and Professor Kaufman and her students are engaging with local elementary school students to promote interest in scientific exploration and discovery. <br/><br/>The project is exploring the excited state properties of individual polymer chains, as well as polymers that are organized together as aggregates.  The focus is on polyfluorenes, perylene diimides, and polyacenes, each of which are promising for optoelectronic applications.  Professor Kaufman and her students use approaches recently developed in her laboratory to control the assembly of single polymer chains into aggregates of particular size and structure through variation in solvent mixture and swelling. Preparation of aggregates of different packing densities is accomplished by careful selection of molecular properties and by tuning the aggregation to be driven by Ostwald ripening or coalescence. Spectroscopic properties (e.g. absorption, emission, anisotropy) are characterized on chromophore-by-chromophore basis using polarization modulation and super-resolution microscopies, which provide a detailed picture of the correlation between polymer conformation and excited state photophysical properties. Through the combination of controlled aggregate formation and detailed spectroscopic measurement, the research team is attempting to ascertain whether morphological ordering on mesoscopic length scales can be used to tune exciton diffusion length and other photophysical characteristics of aggregates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor George Whitesides at Harvard University is exploring how electrons tunnel though molecular layers.  Working with his students, Professor Whitesides is developing new experimental tools to probe tunneling and using them to study how charge flows through self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).  The discoveries could have broad implications for our understanding of biological processes, such as photosynthesis, where charge is transferred across cellular membranes, as well as advance technologies ranging from modern electronics to the lubrication, friction, and wear in soft materials.  <br/><br/>The project is examining the rates of quantum tunneling across organic and organometallic SAMs using EGaIn junctions, which are constructed by sandwiching a SAM between a metal electrode (e.g. Au or Ag) on one side, and an EGaIn (i.e. liquid eutectic between Ga and In) electrode on the other.  The project's goal is to correlate the tunneling current density with the atomic structure of the molecules that make up the SAM, as well as monolayers in contact with polar and non-polar liquids. The team is collaborating with theorists from around the world, who are aiding in the interpretation of the observations.

Professor Cook is studying new catalytic reactions that produce molecules containing a carbon atom bound to four other carbon atoms. Such carbons atoms are called ""all-carbon quaternary centers"".  These carbons can possess a property known as ""chirality"" or ""handedness"". Chiral molecules, like human hands, are not superimposable on their mirror images. The two-handed forms of such molecules (like the left hand or the right hand) can be difficult to generate selectively.  This is even more so in the case of compounds that bear all-carbon quaternary centers. Roughly 10% of the 200 top selling pharmaceuticals contain chiral all-carbon quaternary centers; however, none can be synthesized entirely in a laboratory. Instead, they are formed from naturally occurring sources.  Professor Cook addresses this problem by developing new palladium-catalyzed methods that can selectively form chiral, all-carbon quaternary centers with a preference for one handed form over the other. Professor Cook also works closely with Professor Neufeldt, also at Montana State University, to investigate the mechanism of theses reactions so they can be further improved and optimized.  This project provides excellent preparation for graduate and undergraduate students in future careers in STEM fields, in either academia or industry.  Professor Cook also works on an outreach program to introduce K-12 school students living in Montana's rural areas (including a large Native American population) to practical science and modern instrumentation, with the aim of fostering their interests in STEM subjects and improving their enrollment rates at college.<br/><br/>Professor Cook is exploring the use of new pi-allylic rearrangement chemistry to generate stereogenic all-carbon quaternary centers with high levels of stereoselectivity. He is adopting two approaches, both of which utilize N-alloc carbamates that undergo a decarboxylative rearrangement to generate the requisite stereocenter. These methods overcome the major challenge in pi-allyl chemistry in acyclic systems, efficiently controlling E/Z selectivity in the nucleophile. By utilizing N-alloc enamines, which are much more configurationally stable than their enolate analogs, geometric fidelity can be retained.  This allow catalyst control to dictate the stereochemical outcome. Another strategy being pursued uses N-alloc ynamides, which generate ketenimines following a pi-allylic rearrangement. These ketenimine intermediates then undergo a subsequent sigmatropic rearrangement, nucleophilic addition, or a second pi-allylic rearrangement to generate an all-carbon stereocenter. These ketenimine intermediates are chiral but undergo epimerization, and are being used in dynamic kinetic resolution reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies of both of these reactions are being conducted experimentally and computationally in collaboration with Professor Sharon Neufeldt at Montana State.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play an essential role in the metabolism of living organisms. Anions such as phosphate and nitrate provide essential nutrients for agricultural crops and are therefore widely used in fertilizers.  Inorganic anions, including the highly toxic chromate, are also used in industrial processes and are sources of environmental pollutants. The excessive accumulation of inorganic anions in water could harm the environment by causing eutrophication of lakes and rivers and by poisoning the groundwater that supplies drinking water.  Prof. Gellert Mezei's group at Western Michigan University designs and synthesizes a unique class of anion-binding agents, termed 'nanojars'.  By studying the interactions of anions with these nanojars, the team aims to gain a better fundamental understanding of the factors governing selective recognition of anions and to provide insight to the future design of highly efficient anion-binding agents, not only for removing toxic anions from water, but also for recovering valuable anions, such as phosphate.  This project also provides research opportunities to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, offers education of the general public about Science through public events such as the ""Chemistry Day at the Museum"", and promotes collaborations with the industrial sector.<br/><br/>Selective extraction of specific anions from water is a challenging task, especially in the case of hydrophilic oxyanions of high charge density. Such anions, including phosphate and chromate, are strongly bound by water and are difficult to transfer into a water-immiscible, hydrophobic phase, from which they could be recovered or properly disposed of.  With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Prof. Mezei's group investigates anion encapsulation in nanojars to understand the structural intricacies needed for designing highly selective anion-binding agents. The nanojars are nanometer-sized supramolecular structures with a hydrophilic anion-binding pocket lined with hydrogen-bond donors and a hydrophobic, rigidifiable outer shell.  They offer a promising compromise between the large size of anion-binding proteins (which are impractical for large scale, industrial applications) and the poor selectivity of small-molecule anion receptors in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Professors Maryanne Collinson and Sarah Rutan at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) are exploring an alternate approach in the field of chemical separations. Instead of manipulating the composition of the mobile phase during the course of a separation, the stationary phase composition is instead changed. Gradual changes in stationary phases have many advantages including the ability to improve selectivity, separation times, and the ability to detect species in the mixture.  The synergy between the collaborating research groups enhances the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art materials synthesis, chromatography, and the predictive power provided by simulations. In addition, by developing a peer-coaching relationship with new faculty, undergraduate instruction in analytical chemistry at VCU is being enhanced.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the following three specific aims: (1) design, construction, and characterization of liquid chromatography columns with a continuous gradient in chemical functionality along their length, (2) development and implementation of tools to predict the chromatographic responses for various sets of analytes on a continuous gradient stationary phase, and (3) coupling simulations with experiments to determine what gradient lengths and compositions are needed to obtain optimum separations, thus avoiding the trial and error approach usually used in method development. For proof-of-principle, silica monolithic columns and columns packed with superficially porous particles are strategically modified to incorporate a continuous gradient in C8, C18, amine, and/or phenyl groups using silane chemistry and controlled rate infusion (CRI), a method recently developed in the Collinson group. The integration of the Collinson group's expertise in sol-gel chemistry and surface chemical gradients with the Rutan group's expertise in modeling of separations and liquid chromatography is leading to the development of new methodologies for problems of societal relevance, ranging from biomarker discovery to detection of low levels of environmental contaminants."

The synthetic methods being developed target carbon-carbon bond formations, which are central to the advancement of polymer, materials, and medicinal chemistry.  Graphene's extraordinary properties have generated considerable interest in this material and its substructures for many applications, including molecular electronics, catalysis, and sensing.

This chemistry is being used to target several novel classes of graphene nanostructures and related large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and all syntheses are driven by the pursuit of novel or enhanced properties. Electronic and optical properties are firmly established at the molecular level using various absorption and emission spectroscopies and electrochemical methods. As appropriate, these properties are then probed at the supramolecular, monolayer, and/or solid-state levels.

NMR's clinical cousin, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also a useful tool for producing images of soft tissues in the body.  Both methods usually suffer from relatively low sensitivity - meaning that it cannot detect small amounts of sample.  ""Hyperpolarization"" methods, which can increase the signal by a factor of 1000 or more, have been extensively explored over the last decade, but fewer than 1% of all NMRs and MRIs have access to this technology.  Hyperpolarization is technically challenging and extremely expensive.  With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - A Program, Professors Warren Warren, Steven Malcolmson, and Thomas Theis and their groups at Duke University are working to expand the availability and utility of hyperpolarization (a readily prepared reagent).  They are developing new catalysts to speed sample preparation and an instrument that can be built for about 1% of the cost of competitive approaches.  This research is both expanding the range of possible molecular targets and increasing the attainable sensitivity.  The project could ultimately enable low-cost, portable MRI instruments.  The team is providing research and training opportunities in these critical technologies for members of underrepresented groups, and providing substantial K-12 science outreach.<br/><br/>The low sensitivity of NMR and MRI is often a severe limitation.  Hyperpolarization methods (mostly dynamic nuclear polarization, DNP) can increase the observable signal as much as 10,000 times in virtually any organic molecule, but hyperpolarization decays back to thermal equilibrium at a rate given by the nuclear spin lifetime T1, which in solution is commonly seconds.  These short relaxation times limit the processes that can be studied by the method.  In addition, the associated apparatus is complicated and expensive (ca. $2.5M for clinical systems).  The team at Duke has shown that pulse sequences can load and unload long-lived states in many molecules, effectively lengthening homogeneous relaxation times to many minutes. Their new approaches to hyperpolarization (SABRE-SHEATH and LIGHT-SABRE) have increased 15Nitrogen or 13Carbon polarization by up to five orders of magnitude (relative to thermal populations) using an ultralow-field apparatus (about 1% of the Earth's field) that can be built by undergraduates.  They are now working to improve polarization rates, total polarization, and the generality of these methods.  The aim of this research project is to reduce the sensitivity to molecular parameters and increase reliability.  The work includes a mixture of discovery, basic theoretical extensions of the density matrix understanding of magnetic resonance, detailed quantum mechanical and molecule dynamics simulations, targeted synthesis, and demonstration of useful applications. The research is addressing fundamental questions about spin dynamics. The systems reflect a new class of ""reactive intermediates"" which go back to their original state, yet create a useful product (spin polarized nuclei).  Other extensions focus on the complex role of molecular symmetry in isolating states from their environment, and on developing tools to access ever-better protected states.  Broader impacts arise from the potential to create a wide variety of Magnetic Resonance-trackable molecular targets, with applications from organometallic chemistry to clinical imaging."

One specific objective is to construct a thin-film molecular magneto-electric system where the magnetic properties of the molecular overlayer are altered by an applied electric field in either the ground state or the excited state.  The starting point is the combination of an iron spin-crossover complex with the highly dipolar p-benzoquinonemonoimine zwitterion.  The research project grows to include other spin crossover complexes in combination with a wide range of strongly dipolar molecules.  Another objective includes the construction of a co-crystal heteromolecular structure in order to isothermally control switching between magnetic low-spin and high-spin states of selected molecules.  The ultimate goal is to achieve voltage-controlled, magnetic moment-based devices of very small dimensions while delivering low-power, gigahertz, nonvolatile, local magneto-electric logic or memory operations with diminish latency time and much reduced power consumption.  This project brings together investigations of fundamental interface chemistry, dipole coupling at hetero-molecular interfaces, the modeling of frontier orbitals, the fabrication of defined high-quality organic multilayers, and the characterization of magnetic induction with an applied electric field."

Despite the growing interest in this field, there remains a large gap in the fundamental understanding of how the structure of a protein and/or protein complex dictates the measurements. This research seeks to fill this knowledge gap by detailing how making the measurement itself can change the protein or protein complex. Mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are used to analyze biological samples that are important to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.

The goals of this research include demonstrating the means by which the opposite charge contributions to ESI-generated ions can be manipulated.  The project also tests trends predicted by models; e.g., effects on gas phase cross-sections, on the products and charge-state distributions arising from collision induced dissociation of gas phase assemblies, and on the relationship between gas and solution phase structures of intrinsically-disordered proteins.

Nanocrystals are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes. Nanocrystals are also unusual in that a large fraction of the atoms are at or very near the surface, so rearrangement, exchange and addition of atoms in the particle with the atmosphere or a surrounding liquid is much easier for a nanocrystal than for a bulk solid in contact with the same gas or liquid, where the atoms are typically inside the solid and not accessible.  Professor Mayer is studying particular metal oxide nanocrystals, including titanium dioxide (the pigment in white paint and a primary component of dye-sensitized solar cells), zinc oxide (a UV protectant in some sunscreens), and cerium oxide (a key part of automobile catalytic converters).  The PI and his team are performing experiments that elucidate a new way of thinking about chemical processes at the surfaces of these materials.   The results from these studies should have broad impact in many fields, since metal oxides are extremely common materials. The broad and fundamental approach provides an excellent training environment for graduate students. The Mayer lab is also sharing with middle and high school students the excitement of developing a new way of thinking about an important area of science, through open houses and hands-on summer programs. <br/><br/>Oxidation and reduction reactions at semiconducting metal oxide/solution interfaces are pervasive, from catalysis to the environment. Work in the Mayer laboratory at Yale University, supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program at NSF, is developing a new paradigm for such chemical processes at oxide surfaces. Mayer and co-workers are studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of stoichiometric transfers of electrons, protons, and hydrogen atoms to colloidal nanocrystals of ZnO, TiO2, CeO2 and other materials, suspended in organic solvents. Their studies show that current focus on transferring electrons needs to be broadened to include the cations that balance the electron charge. Thus the reaction chemistry is in many cases better described as inner-sphere processes, in which electron transfer is coupled to the making and breaking of chemical bonds. Reactions such as hydrogen atom transfers and multi-electron processes are being examined. Part of this new approach is a rethinking of the thermodynamics of interfacial reactions, building a new thermochemical scale for oxide materials based on their affinities for hydrogen, rather than using electronic band energies. The ubiquity of interfacial redox reactions makes this work of substantial potential broader impact, from energy conversions to corrosion. The broad approach is providing a challenging and stimulating interdisciplinary environment for the scientific growth of a diverse group of graduate students. The excitement of developing a new way of thinking is the basis of the Mayer lab's outreach to middle and high school students, both via open houses and hands-on summer programs."

As the probe moves across the surface it generates electrical signals which describe the properties of the surface (hardness, roughness, cracks, wettability, elasticity, etc.).  In this way, it produces an image of the surface. This information is important for visually characterizing the surface. AFM is useful for understanding why a chemical reaction may occur on the surface, or why the surface is unreactive (inert).

Emphasis is being placed on attracting students to STEM fields, including those from groups that are presently underrepresented. <br/><br/>The current understanding of electron delocalization in saturated molecules such as oligosilanes and polysilanes (silicon analogs of saturated hydrocarbons) lags far behind that in conjugated pi-electron systems. Geometrical distortions induced in peralkylated oligosilane chains by light absorption are particularly intriguing. Fluorescence reveals that they are negligible in long chains and very pronounced in chains containing fewer than about seven silicon atoms. Calculations suggest that the distortions can be described as a transformation of one or two of the silicon atoms from the normal tetrahedral to trigonal bipyramidal geometry, in which silicon used five ""valence"" orbitals instead of the usual four. Such expansion of the silicon valence shell would have fundamental importance for bonding theory. Professor Michl's group is attempting to verify the theoretical prediction experimentally, using vibrational spectroscopy of the short-lived excited species. The same methods of transient vibrational spectroscopy are useful for other photophysical problems, in particular in the investigation of materials known to undergo efficient singlet fission, such as the higher polyacenes and derivatives of isobenzofuran. The work involves continuing international collaborations, providing undergraduate students a research experience, and giving classroom demonstrations to high school students."

The type of reactor being studied utilizes a catalyst molecule that contains either ruthenium or copper to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Energy from sunlight is, thus, used to extract a sustainable source of fuel from water, but the precise way it works is not fully understood. This lack of understanding hinders the design and improvement of catalysts and reactors for this important technological process. One of the complicating factors in studies of this system is the presence of the water itself. The current research is getting around this problem by removing the molecules produced in the solar reactor and putting them into a vacuum. Highly sophisticated pieces of equipment can then be used to study the detailed nature of these chemical species. The measurements made in vacuum will then provide signatures that can be used later to identify those species when water is present, in other words, in the reactor as it normally functions. The work addresses an important societal problem, the development of alternative sources of energy that do not rely on carbon-based fuels. Training the next generation of scientists is an integral part of this project. It includes budding researchers as young as grades five through nine through a Saturday morning science program.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators are studying the electronic and geometric structures of selected ruthenium- and copper-based catalysts for water oxidation, as well as certain reaction intermediates that arise in the catalytic conversion process. Ions of catalyst and reaction intermediates are transferred into the gas phase by electrospray ionization. The ions are then cooled in an ion trap, mass selected, and irradiated by pulsed light, which is tunable throughout the mid-IR, visible and near-UV spectrum. Photon absorption is monitored by photofragmentation of the target ions, allowing the measurement of their vibrational and electronic spectra.  Cooling the ions to low temperatures is crucial to obtain the necessary spectroscopic detail. Vibrational spectra will result in structural information about the ions under study, which is particularly important for reaction intermediates. Measuring the electronic spectra of catalysts and reaction intermediates will aid clarification of speciation in reactive solutions. In addition, the excited state vibrational structure is assisting the investigators in computational modeling studies of the excited state dynamics and reactivity."

The objectives of the molecular modeling work are to (1) understand the driving force for surface freezing in chain-like molecules, and (2) calculate liquid-solid nucleation rates to compare directly to the measured values. Supersonic nozzle flows are to generate liquid droplets in highly non-equilibrium states with static pressure measurements to characterize the flow, spatially resolved small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) to characterize the aerosol, and infrared spectroscopy to quantify the distribution of the condensable fraction among the vapor, liquid and solid states. Efforts to develop single nanodroplet/nanocrystal X-ray diffraction measurements to measure the structure of freezing clusters on a particle-by-particle basis using free electron lasers are to be extended.

To realize a practical quantum computer, an important prerequisite is the construction of the basic hardware units for performing quantum computation, called qubits.  The qubit is analogous to the bit found in modern digital computers. However, unlike a bit, which can be in one of two different states, qubits can exist in many different states. One of the challenges in quantum computation is the construction of the qubits in large scale and in a robust manner for practical and low-cost implementation of quantum computation. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Dong Son and Alexey Akimov at Texas A&M University are developing a new qubit platform based on chemically synthesized quantum dots that can be mass-produced with extremely high uniformity and assembled in a precisely controlled manner. While the fabrication and positioning of the QDs on the nanometer scale is very risky, the research may have broad implications for the development of quantum computers and quantum information systems. The project also provides training opportunities for students, in an interdisciplinary environment that combines chemistry and quantum optics. <br/><br/>Working alongside with their students, Professors Son and Akimov are developing templating strategies to fabricate qubit structures based on finite-sized arrays of perovskite quantum dots, with each structure being replicated many times in large scale. The approach takes advantage of recent progress in chemical synthesis of structurally identical quantum dots used as the building blocks of the qubits. Understanding and controlling the behavior of the quantum mechanically coupled excitons and spins of the magnetic impurities doped in the quantum dot arrays is particularly important to verify the functionality of the new structures. For this purpose, photoluminescence optical microscopy methods are used to characterize the qubit structures and to confirm the quantum mechanical behavior needed for the scaled-up qubit platform to function as a robust quantum computer. These are necessary steps to take towards the application of quantum computation to solve real-world problems. The team, composed of a chemist and a physicist, is also actively developing the interdisciplinary and outreach programs that utilize the new frontiers of modern science to educate the next-generation scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moore's Law, which has held for the last four decades, states that the density of transistors on an electronic device ""chip"" will double approximately every two years, making electronic devices smaller, faster and more powerful.  A pressing question is whether Moore's Law will continue into the future or has it reached its fundamental limits.

They design, synthesize and evaluate the conductive properties of porphyrinoids assembled into specific structures on surfaces. Using imaging techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the team can place individual molecules into precise arrangements on surfaces and measure not only their assembled structure at the molecular level but also how the structure controls the movement of electrons through the molecules.  This research has broader impacts in science and technology, and enables the rational design of potential molecular electronic devices, including enhanced photovoltaics, chemical sensors and molecular electronics.

In this project porphryinoids are assembled on Au surfaces in precise architectures via a combination of nanolithography and directed click-chemical reactions to create nanoscopic assemblies of less than 10 nm in lateral dimension.  Characterization methods (time resolved florescence, UV-visible absorption, STM and AFM) are applied to understand how local molecular interactions influence electron transport properties in small molecule assemblies, how spatial confinement of molecules on a surface influence their resulting assembly process and the structures that can be formed, and how the assembled architectures control electron transport.   Broader impacts of the research result in an improved fundamental understanding of the assembly and electron transport properties of the porphryiods, with potential to influence molecular electronic device and solar light harvesting applications.  Broader impacts through education and outreach incorporate aspects of the work, including atomic scale imaging, nanolithography, molecular self-assembly and nanoscale electronics, into demonstrations for elementary school students as part of a weeklong summer camp on Nanotechnology (at Texas A&M University), and into the undergraduate and graduate classrooms at Texas A&M University and CUNY Hunter College."

Therefore, the chirality of an object is sometimes termed its handedness. Many important molecules are chiral, including drugs, proteins, and DNA.  In the case of pharmaceuticals, the chirality of the drug is absolutely essential to its function.  Molecular chirality is measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.

As such, Raman spectroscopy is extremely useful for a number of applications in chemical, environmental and threat detection monitoring.  While a highly useful technique, the Raman scattering cross-section of most molecules is extremely small, and this generally limits its potential uses. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS), the techniques investigated in this research project, can be used to improve the small signal intensities, thus making Raman spectroscopy-related applications more practical. In terms of broader impacts Dr. Cronin creates workshops for Los Angeles high school chemistry teachers. He leverages existing relationships between USC and its neighboring high schools (e.g., USC's Good Neighbors Campaign, Joint Education Project, and the Service Learning Program) to increase the attendance from disadvantaged schools (i.e., central Los Angeles inner city schools) serving underrepresented minority groups. The content of the workshop is reformulated to expose underrepresented students to the results and, more importantly, the excitement of research. Research projects for undergraduate students introduce them to fundamental scientific research and give them confidence to pursue careers in science and engineering. A new module devoted to SERS is developed for a new course at USC on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and their research accomplishments are discussed in class and integrated into the curriculum.

Specifically, Professor Cronin's group at USC performs Raman spectroscopy of single molecules on various SERS substrates, which enables a direct comparison with the theoretical calculations preformed at the Jensen's group at PSU.  The Raman spectra are collected under various electrochemical conditions in order to explore the role of the molecule-metal energy level alignment and decouple the vibrational-mode-specific chemical enhancement from the uniform chemical enhancement.  Professor Jensen's first principles calculations provide a detailed theoretical framework for interpreting chemical enhancement in SERS and GERS spectra to facilitate a better understanding of the chemical enhancement mechanism.

Professor Brooke Kammrath from the University of New Haven and colleague Virginia Maxwell have acquired a laser induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system.  This instrument is used to identify the chemical elements in a range of samples. It employs a laser to ablate (vaporize) material from the sample of interest. The plasma produced by the laser contains excited atoms which emit their characteristic light. The emitted light is then detected by a spectrometer. The acquired spectrum can identify and quantify the elemental composition of the sample. The LIBS system is used for elemental analysis of a variety of samples of interest to forensics, chemistry, geology, biology and engineering. Several of the projects are directed at forensic science. Here the goal is to evaluate whether the technique can be established as a reliable tool. This provides a significant societal effect.  Undergraduate and master degree students receive training to use the LIBS system in their research projects.  This training in chemical analysis helps prepare them for future careers and advanced degrees.    <br/><br/>The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels It especially aids in the identification and characterization of microscopic samples of forensic interest. Other projects test the reliability of the technique in soil analysis, evaluating drug delivery vehicles in living cells, carrying out paint analysis and in geological applications. The spectrometer is also used for the development of new methods to analyze forensic evidence and for the analyses of bullet metals and gunshot residue.

In simple materials, chemical reactions or processes can be experimentally parsed into fundamental steps, each with a well-defined rate.  When a material is composed of complex molecules or molecular assemblies, these fundamental steps often appear to have a spread of rates.  The multidimensional methods being developed at the Professor Berg's lab help to determine the nature and lifetime of states which cause the spread of rates.  The methods being developed here extend to a wide range of processes and materials in biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering. Professor Berg works with graduate and undergraduate students closely on the development of these complex methods of characterizing matter. He is also involved in a number of creative approaches to engage students from underrepresented minority groups in the research project. <br/><br/>Three subprojects each address a different material, kinetic problem and technical challenge.  The rotation rates of probe molecules inserted into microstructured materials are currently used to measure local viscosity at specific points within the structure.  These experiments often yield a range of rotational rates.  Six-pulse, polarized optical experiments are being developed to determine whether this range is caused by variability in the microstructure or by local anisotropy in the structure.  The green-fluorescent protein (GFP) is a prototype for understanding reaction dynamics within a protein.  A multicolor, multidimensional, optical experiment is being developed to determine if the multiple rates observed in GFP kinetics are due to multiple protein substates or due to unresolved intermediate steps in the photocycle.  Multidimensional methods of analyzing computer simulations are being developed to understand the formation of long-lived structures within liquids as the liquid is cooled.  Although experiments can see these effects at low temperatures, simulations are currently the best approach to probing their initial formation at higher temperatures. Professor Berg intends not only to advance fundamental understanding about molecular reaction kinetics but also to provide students an interdisciplinary training experience, in particular those students from underrepresented minority groups."

Weinert of Oklahoma State University to synthesize molecules that contain chains of germanium atoms (oligogermanes). Systems with very long germanium chains and germanium nanomaterials are known to have important electronic and optical properties that depend on the number of germanium atoms in the chain and on the other groups appended to the chain. In this study, both the number of germanium atoms and the substituent groups are carefully controlled.  Since the properties of these molecules can be tuned by variation of their composition, discrete molecules with specific absorbance, emission, and conductive properties can be designed and prepared. The broader impacts include the development of conductive new materials with tunable optical properties that may be used in lenses, detectors, or other optical applications. In addition to the education and training of graduate students, the project will involve Native American high school or undergraduate students from Oklahoma with the ultimate goal of inspiring these students to pursue careers in science. <br/><br/>Singly-bonded catenates of germanium are of interest sigma-delocalization that results in interesting optical and electronic properties that can be tuned by varying their composition.  Recent DFT calculations indicate that polygermanes, and potentially oligogermanes, can function as quasi-one dimensional semiconductors with a direct bandgap, where the valence and conduction bands result mainly from the catenated germanium skeleton. In this project, the Weinert research team is undertaking the synthesis of a diverse array of long-chain linear oligogermanes in order to ascertain if these new molecules will exhibit useful optical and/or conductive attributes akin to the polygermane analogues. The new molecules prepared in these investigations are characterized by a variety of techniques, including NMR, UV/visible, emission spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. Studying the solid-state structures of these molecules is important since the overall geometry of the oligogermane affects its physical properties.  Another aspect of this project involves the incorporation of oligogermanes into the graphite electrodes of high-end batteries in order to improve the overall performance of these systems, and these studies are being done in collaboration with a research team at Technical University in  Graz, Austria.  The photochemistry of these oligogermanes is being investigated, with the goal of affecting photochemical rearrangements of these molecules to new species that are not available by purely synthetic routes."

Specifically, Professor Cheong is developing theoretical tools and applying these methods in order to determine the central factors that determine the mechanism and the stereoselectivity of: (i) site-selective desymmetrization of cis-1,2-diols by scaffolding organic catalysts; (ii) kinetic resolution of beta-amino alcohols by beta-hairpin peptide-catalyzed acylation, and (iii) phosphine-catalyzed nucleophilic coupling of allenoates.

The goal of this research program is to design new catalysts that allow for the direct functionalization of both simple and complex aromatic molecules, including pharmaceuticals and proteins. Lewis basic groups are capable of activating electrophiles and are readily incorporated into catalyst structures, allowing for modular catalyst design.    The project lies at the interface of catalytic, synthetic and physical organic chemistry. Therefore, it is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Gustafson's group is well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science due to San Diego State University's unique and diverse student population.  Outreach activities involving underrepresented students at community colleges are part of the project. <br/><br/>Lewis bases can catalytically activate diverse electrophiles towards electrophilic addition reactions. The Gustafson group has recently demonstrated that Lewis bases such as thioureas and phosphine sulfides can catalyze the halogenation or sulfenylation of aromatic feedstocks under very mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest this chemistry proceeds through a covalent halenium-catalyst adduct, and that the structure of the catalyst can influence the reaction outcome.  The proposed research involves both in-depth mechanistic studies and the development of new catalysts to extend the project to more complex systems.   There are three major questions this proposal strives to answer: How do Lewis base catalysts control the regioselectivity of phenol chlorination, and can this selectivity be extended to other classes of arenes? Second, how do Lewis bases conjugated to Bronsted acids catalyze the mild sulfenylation of heterocycles, and can this reaction be extended to peptides, proteins, and natural products? Furthermore, can changes in the Lewis base lead to chemoselectivity towards other classes of arenes?   Finally, can chiral Lewis base catalysts be designed to effect enantioselective halogenation and sulfenylation? The educational plan includes outreach to underrepresented students at local community colleges to introduce them to research opportunities available to undergraduates. This outreach activity includes hands-on presentations at local community colleges that introduce students to computational chemistry in the context of the conformational analysis of butane."

Actually, nitrogen is abundant and easily accessible as it makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, atmospheric nitrogen gas is very difficult to convert into forms that can be used for practical applications. In fact, the industrial conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (the basic component of agricultural fertilizer and many industrial processes) utilizes extreme amounts of energy and the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen directly to a number of other industrial chemicals is not developed. In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Connie Lu of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities is addressing these problems by developing ways to convert atmospheric nitrogen into chemicals other than ammonia. The methods utilize cobalt and iron compounds to transfer electrons to nitrogen. This activates the nitrogen and permits it be converted to a class of compounds know as amines, which are the basic building blocks for many industrially important chemicals.  The project contains a strong educational component in which undergraduate and graduate students are trained for future careers in science and technology.  Additionally, an outreach component provides  experimental modules for middle and high-school students to teach topics of sustainability and catalysis.<br/><br/>The redox processes available to first-row metal-metal bonded complexes can be more flexible than those of individual metals. This effect is seen in multi-metallic compounds, which are versatile catalysts for a broad range of organic and inorganic transformation. This property is utilized to prepare catalysts for the conversion of dinitrogen to amines. A series of bimetallic Co-M and Fe-M (M = Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Co) complexes are prepared and their redox flexibility characterized by synchrotron and theoretical methods. The ability of these species to catalyze the silylation of dinitrogen is investigated and the mechanism of this process is determined by chemical and theoretical studies. The goal  is to devise catalytic N&#8722;C bond formation directly from dinitrogen. Throught these activities undergraduate and graduate students become skilled in syntheis, catalyst development, and mechanistic studies.

However, there are important problems for which the existing techniques are inadequate.  Most prominently, current computational tools do not properly describe the strong correlations which are responsible for superconductivity and various important magnetic phenomena.  This research seeks to remedy that deficiency by extending conventional methods in a new and unique direction.  These new methods will be applied to study the strong correlations in graphitic systems, which serve as prototypes for systems displaying magnetic ordering.  In the longer term, the tools developed in this proposal will be useful for other researchers in chemistry, physics, and materials science as well.  A diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral associates are involved in carrying out this research. <br/><br/><br/>In order to accomplish these goals, Scuseria and coworkers  combine the recently developed pair coupled cluster theory (which is able to describe strong static correlations) with Lie algebraic similarity transformation (which is able to describe the remaining weak correlations needed to reach quantitative accuracy).  The combination of these two techniques should describe both strong and weak correlations with reasonable expense while avoiding the unphysical symmetry breaking which more conventional methods require but which makes their predictions somewhat suspect.  The applications to fullerenes, graphene nanoribbons, and nanodots will demonstrate the capabilities of this new computational approach and will help explain their unique properties."

Naturally occurring nucleobases are known to protect themselves against UV radiation through processes within the nucleobase molecule that dissipate potentially harmful UV energy into heat. However, the details of these processes are not well understood.   Prof. Ullrich is uncovering these details by making slight changes to the nucleobase structure, and observing changes in how UV light is dissipated.   In some cases, for example when an oxygen atom is replaced by a sulfur atom, the nucleobase has difficulty dissipating the energy from the UV light.  This is to say it remains ""excited"", and therefore vulnerable to damage.

The inclusion of the boron also provides the potential for polymers with inherent sensing capabilities.  The main thrusts of this research are: 1) to synthesize boron-containing conjugated homopolymers and study the n-type conducting properties; 2) to explore the potential application of boron-containing conjugated polymers in detecting electron-rich gas; and 3) to develop novel synthetic approaches to boron-containing donor/acceptor copolymers (which contain alternating electron-accepting and electron-donating moieties) as narrow band-gap conjugated polymers."

Many parts of research plans are modularly designed in to accommodate the tight schedules of high school and college students. This facilitates the participation of these students into the STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project employs individual macromolecules, such as DNA, as platforms for analyte sensing. Upon the binding of an analyte, the macromolecule changes its conformation, which is accompanied by a variation in mechanical properties, such as tension, due to the mechanochemical coupling. Using laser tweezers, the change in the mechanical property is monitored in real time, accomplishing the sensing without extra infrastructure used in a separate signal transduction unit. Since single-molecule templates are used, detection of individual molecules is the result. This represents the utmost sensitivity for biosensing. Compared to other single-molecule detection schemes such as fluorescence, the force signal employed in a mechanochemical sensor suffers little from environmental noise. In addition, the measurement of force does not require direct light excitation, which avoids photo-damage to the sensing template. All these facts render strong reliability and high sensitivity for this new sensing strategy."

Building upon insights gained from extensive kinetic study of iron-catalyzed hydromagnesiation, the latter strategy investigates new systems that achieve hydrozincation/carboxylation in a single catalytic reaction. Rational method optimization is accomplished in parallel with studies of catalytic reaction mechanisms using a combination of operando spectroscopic techniques, studies of stoichiometric reactions and preparation of plausible intermediates, as well as computational methods. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Professor Popp is organizing new training and career mentorship opportunities for STEM-interested student Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces at WVU, collaborating with a primarily undergraduate institution in the Appalachian region on catalysis research relevant to this project, and developing a new multimedia tool for organic chemistry education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposal has impact in several areas; the elevation of nitrile chemistry, student training and development, and improving the ability of students' writing. The research falls into three broad areas that will develop new reactions of nitriles for the synthesis of cyclic, carbon-based scaffolds of relevance for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and new materials. The first third of the proposal focuses on an extremely rapid synthesis of bicyclic nitriles, the middle third develops counter-intuitive methods of creating new carbon-carbon bonds, and the last section of the proposal develops new routes to reactive nitrile intermediates to control the three dimensional shape of nitrile-substituted scaffolds. The project continues an excellent track record in training students and post-doctoral associates, particularly minorities and women, to provide a stream of bright, highly motivated students for careers in science. The approach features vigorous research training with synergistic mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and an emphasis on career life balance through group educational events and annual professional development retreats. Improved writing skills are taught through a review writing strategy that transitions undergraduate and graduate students from novice learners to expert practitioners. The approach simultaneously addresses a general writing deficiency in many students while instilling tools to critically evaluate the primary literature. Publishing the strategy in the Journal of Chemical Education should allow others to replicate the strategy with other students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project focuses on a blend of conceptually new bond constructions and new chemical entities, many of which challenge conventional processes. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of preparing chiral decalones in a single synthetic operation, potentially replacing multi-step technology based on the Wieland-Miescher ketone. A highly unusual equilibration is under development which changes the stereochemistry of a quaternary bridgehead center; a process that challenges conventional notions. A counter-intuitive alkylation of metalated nitriles with unactivated alkenes is rapidly assembling tricyclic ketones. A complementary alkene addition uses S-ketenimines as particularly attractive nucleophiles to address two long-standing challenges: rapid access to stable ketenimine nucleophiles, and nitrile-based alkenylations. The last section of the proposal provides an orthogonal, innovative asymmetric alkylation with metalated nitriles. Collectively, the proposed research exploits the unique reactivity of nitriles consummate with the long-term objective of elevating metalated nitrile alkylations to a level of influence comparable to that of enolate alkylations."

Professor Overman is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. He proposes to develop new ways to join complex molecular fragments to prepare high-value organic molecules. By building complex pieces of a molecule independently and then coupling them together at the end of a synthesis, inefficient linear sequences that build the entire structure one step at a time can be avoided. The method under development is particularly impressive in that it combines the complex fragments in a one to one ratio. Thus, it avoids the more common need to waste valuable material by using one of the complex fragments in excess. In these studies, Professor Overman and his coworkers employ photoredox catalysis for the coupling reactions. Such transformation are attractive because they use visible light as the energy source for making new bonds. This use of sustainable energy for the reactions help to minimize their environmental impact. The broad scope of the research involving photocatalysis, mechanistic and target-directed synthesis objectives is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Overman's group has a long established record of providing the highest level of education and training for coworkers including those underrepresented in science. Many of these students now hold leading positions in both academics and the pharmaceutical industry.  <br/><br/>Bimolecular chemical reactions that combine complex fragments in good yield, and, where important, with high stereocontrol, are fundamental for implementing convergent synthetic strategies. When the atoms joined in a fragment-coupling step are chiral, this union is particularly challenging. Recent discoveries from Professor Overman's laboratories show that bimolecular reactions of structurally elaborate tertiary carbon radicals and electron-deficient alkenes can join complex fragments by forming new bonds in high yields and high stereocontrol using equimolar (or nearly equimolar) amounts of the two coupling partners. Such chemical transformations are not currently a common part of the repertoire of organic synthesis, yet hold exciting potential to solve formidable challenges in constructing complex organic molecules. The proposed studies define the mechanism and optimize the generation and coupling of tertiary radicals formed from tertiary alcohol hemioxalate precursors, explore 1,6-additions of carbon radicals to electrophilic dienes and develop multicomponent radical-anionic crossover reactions, and define the utility of tertiary-radical fragment coupling strategies in the enantioselective total synthesis of structurally elaborate diterpenoids harboring dioxobicyclo[3.3.0]octanone fragments and ent-kaurene diterpenoids.  These organic reactions have important technical broader impacts on the pharmaceutical industry."

However, CO2 is hard to react and requires additional complexes (catalysts) to assist in the conversion to other molecules. Despite considerable progress, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the principles that connect catalyst structure with catalyst performance.

In biological systems enzymes are exceedingly efficient at carrying out chemical reactions that are important to life. In fact, enzymes are often much more efficient than laboratory or industrial catalysts. Because of this they can be very useful guides in the design of new catalysts. Dr. Douglas B.

The physical and chemical properties of fine particles are critical in controlling their behavior. The properties of these particles are significantly different from liquids or solids. Typical particles are about 300 nanometers in diameter and contain roughly 10 million individual molecules. Well over half of those molecules are organic (carbon containing) compounds, and even a single particle often contains hundreds of thousands of different organic molecules, most of which have never been isolated or synthesized by chemists. These organic molecules stick to the tiny particles rather than letting go of the particle and floating (volatilizing) into the air. Some of the organic compounds resemble asphalt or complex sugars.  This research advances fundamental understanding of how combustion processes and products related to energy production may influence human health.    <br/><br/>Professor Neil Donahue and his graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University study the behavior of a number of model systems using sophisticated mass spectrometers that can measure the composition of individual 300 nm particles along with complementary chemical ionization mass spectrometers that can measure individual molecules in the gas and particle phases. They generate organic particles mimicking those found in the atmosphere with progressively higher degrees of oxidation to see if the particles become more viscous in a way that matters - by directly testing if semi-volatile organics can diffuse into the particles and whether two initially distinct populations of particles with semi-volatile constituents evolve toward each other because of mixing. The researchers conduct these experiments over a wide range of relative humidity conditions as humidity varies widely in the atmosphere and because wet particles are known to be much less viscous and more diffusive. Via a collaboration with colleagues at Northwestern University, they use synthesized molecules containing the stable carbon isotope, 13C, to cleanly separate molecules from different particle populations using mass spectrometry. The project prepares doctoral students for a research career. Professor Donahue is an ambassador in the Science and Engineering Ambassadors Program founded by the National Academies.

New processes may eventually permit industrial chemists to achieve more sustainable processes by employing available and underappreciated carbon feedstocks, and abundant, non-toxic reagents in production.  Within this project, the mechanisms of specific reaction steps involved in hydrocarbon functionalization, such as carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and incorporation of oxygen from air, are being carefully investigated for their optimal application in selective catalysis. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students is being trained in modern methods for studying catalysis and mechanism.  Students are encouraged to pursue careers in science, with emphasis on the need for a strong workforce of effective independent scientists.  Outreach to high school students and the general public is being planned to communicate the vital role of catalysis research in finding new energy efficient and environmentally benign methods for making many everyday products from plastics, to paints, to pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>Professor Goldberg is developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of fundamental organometallic reactions with potential applications in the functionalization of carbon-hydrogen bonds of hydrocarbons, including selective methane oxidation. New strategies for activating carbon-hydrogen bonds, for selectively activating and incorporating oxygen into metal-alkyl bonds, and for regioselective olefin hydroarylation transformations are being investigated.  Key model reactions are being studied, and through investigations of these stoichiometric and catalytic reactions, critical variables for promoting these transformations are being determined.  Insights concerning specific coordination environments, metal and ligand options, substrate requirements and reaction conditions that favor particular reaction steps are envisaged.  The mechanistic information gleaned from these studies may have a distinctly broader impact on catalysis research, in both academic and industrial settings."

This technique provide the unique fingerprint for chemical identification. As such, Raman spectroscopy is extremely useful for a number of applications in chemical, environmental and threat detection monitoring.  While a highly useful technique, the Raman scattering cross-section of most molecules is extremely small, and this generally limits its potential uses. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS), the techniques investigated in this research project, can be used to improve the small signal intensities, thus making Raman spectroscopy-related applications more practical. In terms of broader impacts Dr. Cronin creates workshops for Los Angeles high school chemistry teachers. He leverages existing relationships between USC and its neighboring high schools (e.g., USC's Good Neighbors Campaign, Joint Education Project, and the Service Learning Program) to increase the attendance from disadvantaged schools (i.e., central Los Angeles inner city schools) serving underrepresented minority groups. The content of the workshop is reformulated to expose underrepresented students to the results and, more importantly, the excitement of research. Research projects for undergraduate students introduce them to fundamental scientific research and give them confidence to pursue careers in science and engineering. A new module devoted to SERS is developed for a new course at USC on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and their research accomplishments are discussed in class and integrated into the curriculum.  Professor Jansen uses a website, nanoHub.org, to share their computational tools with scientists outside of his labs.  <br/><br/>In this collaboration, Professors Cronin and Jensen investigate the mechanism behind the strong spectroscopic responses observed in two surface-based spectroscopic techniques: Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS).  They use both experimental and computational tools to carefully isolate the enhanced Raman signals caused by Chemical Enhancement (CE) from those signals caused by ElectroMagnetic Enhancement (EM) in order to understand the CE mechanism.  Specifically, Professor Cronin's group at USC performs Raman spectroscopy of single molecules on various SERS substrates, which enables a direct comparison with the theoretical calculations preformed at the Jensen's group at PSU.  The Raman spectra are collected under various electrochemical conditions in order to explore the role of the molecule-metal energy level alignment and decouple the vibrational-mode-specific chemical enhancement from the uniform chemical enhancement.  Professor Jensen's first principles calculations provide a detailed theoretical framework for interpreting chemical enhancement in SERS and GERS spectra to facilitate a better understanding of the chemical enhancement mechanism.

He studies peptides containing non-protein amino acids (NPAA), which are found naturally in plants and fungi, but are not used in natural protein synthesis. Many NPAAs are toxic to humans and other animals in part due to structural similarity to one or more of the twenty common protein amino acids (PAA). NPAAs can compete with PAAs in a variety of biological pathways including being mis-incorporated into proteins and peptides. Studying the behavior of peptides into which NPAAs have been systematically substituted helps to understand the relationship between a peptide?s structure and its behavior in the mass spectrometer. Ultimately this enhanced understanding may lead to improved automated peptide sequencing algorithms for proteomics experiments. Professor Jennifer Poutsma performs density functional theory calculations to predict structure and energetics that support and guide the experimental studies. Both research programs integrate research and educational components through the training of undergraduate researchers.

One common transformation is an oxidation reaction, where oxygen is added to or electrons are removed from a molecule. Oxidation reactions often rely on toxic reagents that produce a large amount of waste.  The use of molecular oxygen could reduce both the cost of these reactions and the amount of waste produced. Molecular oxygen is also abundant in air.  Scientists generally do not know how to use atmospheric oxygen to transform molecules into desired products. In this project, Dr. McCormick of Portland State University and Drs. Detty and Cook of the University at Buffalo are investigating dyes that can use energy from light to make desirable molecular transformations with atmospheric oxygen. By understanding how changing the structure of a dye influences its reactivity, it may be possible to control and target these oxidation reactions. Drs. McCormick, Detty, and Cook are dedicated to increasing education in areas of sustainability via the implementation of new courses. They provide research internships to students to increase their awareness of the impact of development on the environment and their role as scientists in creating sustainable solutions.  The curriculum revisions may increase student engagement in issues of sustainability and photochemistry. The modules are disseminated to allow schools across the country to adopt the curriculum, which focuses on on principles of green chemistry, environmental protection, and renewable energy.

McCormick, Detty, and Cook are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate chalcogen-containing dyes as photosensitizers for photocatalytic redox reactions. The use of photo-induced redox catalysis for synthetic transformations is of interest due to its potential for the green production of small molecules at both laboratory and industrial scale. The interchange of the chalcogen atoms (O, S, or Se to Te) in the xanthylium or pyrylium core of the dyes allows control of redox behavior in the dyes, as well as wavelengths of absorption, fluorescence yields and lifetimes, and triplet yields and lifetimes. The chalcogen-containing dyes function as photo-oxidants in that the excited state can accept an electron to give a one-electron oxidation of a substrate. The excited state can also intersystem-cross from singlet to triplet and then interact with ground-state oxygen to generate singlet-oxygen, which can function as a potent oxidant.

Furthermore, the facile reactivity of beta-thiolactones enable multi-component one-pot native chemical ligation and metal-free dethionylation procedures to synthesize complex proteins and glycoproteins. The realization of this approach establishes an efficient route for the chemical synthesis of biologics with minimal separation efforts and maximum reaction output.

Nematodes are very diverse (over 25,000 characterized species) and can be parasitic, causing widespread disease in plants and animals (including humans). Despite the huge impact of nematodes, surprisingly little is known about chemical signaling in members of this important class of organisms. Investigations into the chemical structures and biosynthesis of the chemical signals used by nematodes should enable the development of new chemical tools and strategies to interfere with their life cycles and survival and thus provide new treatment options. This award also promotes the development a discovery-based laboratory course for undergraduates in the isolation of natural products from microorganisms that live inside plants. In this course, students isolate endophytes from plants, generate extracts from these endophytes, and screen the extracts for anti-nematode activities.  <br/><br/>This award aims to characterize the chemical structures of key small-molecule signals that nematodes use to control their development.  The small-molecule signals from representative nematode species can be identified using comparative metabolomics between wild-type worms and biosynthetic mutants.  The relevant compounds are then be purified using mass-guided fractionation, and their structures characterized using NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the chemical structures and biosynthetic gene sequences from different nematode species enables the roles of specific enzymatic domains to be mapped across nematode evolution.  To study the activities of specific enzymatic domains, this study uses a multidisciplinary approach incorporating tools from biochemistry, organic chemistry, structural biology, analytical chemistry, and nematode genetics.  The results of this award are expected to shed light on how nematodes control their life cycles and the development of novel methods to reduce the survival of parasitic nematodes.  The educational portion of this project increases retention of undergraduate students in science fields by developing a discovery-based (rather than cookbook style) laboratory course in natural product identification. The proposed course extends the research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students and may lead to the discovery of novel bacterial/fungal metabolites with anti-nematode activities."

These flow batteries are useful for low-cost and more environmentally-friendly energy storage.  The project focuses on the in-depth understanding of the structure and battery performance relationships of battery components. The new knowledge provides guidance in developing low-cost redox active molecules for the use of redox flow batteries as a environmentally-friendly and scalable energy storage platform, thus, alleviating the global reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing the sustainable development of our society.

These reactions are valuable for forming carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and other types of bonds for the construction of complex organic molecules for use in drug design, the design of new biomaterials, and other advanced manufacturing applications. In cross coupling reactions the control of reaction selectivity is often challenging. If the catalyst cannot differentiate between several possible reaction sites on the molecules, a mixture of products will result. Purification of that mixture increases cost and waste. In this project, Dr. Neufeldt is developing catalysts for cross coupling that efficiently differentiate between similar reactive sites. Both laboratory-based and computational studies are being employed to understand how the  catalyst structure influences the way the catalyst interacts with subtly different sites. This information is being used to design improved catalysts to achieve higher selectivity and efficiency. As part of this project, Dr. Neufeldt is involved in activities to encourage participation of underrepresented minorities in scientific research and improve computational chemistry education at the undergraduate level. These activities include involving students from neighboring tribal colleges in computational chemistry research, implementing computational chemistry labs into the organic curriculum at Montana State University, and engaging in outreach to local schools and tribal colleges. <br/><br/>Dr. Neufeldt is identifying and exploiting new mechanisms by which phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands can influence site selectivity in nickel (Ni)- and palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.

In addition, NHC ligands are under investigation for their ability to influence selectivity between aryl triflates and chlorides in Pd-catalyzed couplings. The origin of selectivity in these systems is examined through a combination of experimental and computational studies. Density functional theory is also employed to design new site-selective catalysts on the computer. The work in this project is valuable for improving the functional group tolerance of cross couplings, facilitating sequential or iterative couplings, and providing insight into catalyst structure-selectivity relationships.

This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program to Professor Amy L. Lane at the University of North Florida and collaborator, Rajesh Viswanathan at Case Western Reserve University funds the investigation of enzymes that catalyze the assembly of natural products known as diketopiperazines.  Diketopiperazines are recognized for a variety of biological functions. This project may reveal details of the function of these enzymes and offer shorter and more sustainable routes for the synthesis of novel molecules for practical applications. Cultivation of the next generation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics professionals is integrated into this RUI award via the training of undergraduates in chemical biology and the development of an inquiry-based lab for undergraduate biochemistry courses that increase student competencies at the interface of chemistry and biology. <br/><br/>Aminoacyl tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are recognized for delivering amino acids to the ribosome for protein assembly. A new role of aa-tRNAs as substrates of cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) was recently established. CDPSs catalyze the assembly of bioactive 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) natural products from two aa-tRNAs. Few known enzyme families use aa-tRNA substrates, making CDPSs unique contributors to the chemistry of life. CDPSs are understudied relative to other common biosynthetic enzymes, and it remains unclear how CDPSs recognize specific aa-tRNAs from the pool of ~50+ different aa-tRNAs in cells. This RUI project aims to decipher molecular determinants of aa-tRNA recognition by CDPSs using two recently characterized CDPSs that yield cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp) DKP from tryptophanyl-tRNA-Trp as experimental models. A library of unnatural aa-tRNAs featuring aminoacyl and tRNA structural variations is evaluated as CDPS substrates, to determine the relationship between aa-tRNA structure and recognition by these CDPSs and provide a single step synthetic biology platform to yield novel DKPs. Molecular models of CDPSs guide the design of site-directed mutagenesis experiments to experimentally determine CDPS residues that are responsible for recognition of aa-tRNA substrates. Results from this study may illuminate the molecular basis of aa-tRNA recognition by CDPSs, enable comparison of molecular determinants of substrate recognition between CDPSs and evolutionary relatives, and extend CDPS-catalyzed DKP chemistry. As its major broader societal impacts, this project provides tools to enable the biological construction of complex DKP natural products for practical applications, yields training opportunities for future scientists, and develop sCDPSs as model enzymes for enhancing undergraduate biochemistry course curricula."

One of the greatest accomplishments in the last 50 years has been the progressive miniaturization of semiconductor devices. This progression is described by ""Moore's Law"" which states that transistors decrease in dimension by one-half approximately every two years.  As miniaturization continues, increasing demands are placed on how these devices are made, and now it requires atom addition (deposition) and removal (etching) methods to produce feature sizes at the atomic scale. Atomic layer etching (ALE) techniques have recently emerged to provide control of the etching process so that a single layer of atoms can be removed in a single step.  Professor George employs a number of techniques to determine the amount of material deposited or removed with atomic layer sensitivity. These experiments also are able to measure the material removal and to identify the surface species present during the etching process. This research is important for the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices, and makes a direct impact on electronics and other high-technology industries. The research is interdisciplinary and involves students with interests ranging from basic science to engineering applications. Dr. George and his group members also actively make their results available through publications and numerous talks at scientific meetings. <br/><br/>In this project, Dr. George explores the thermal ALE process that leads to atomic layer controlled etching. The thermal ALE process is based on sequential and self-limiting surface fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions. The surface fluorination reactions are thermochemically favorable and yield a metal fluoride with a surface coverage on the order of a monolayer. The ligand-exchange reactions are analogous to well-known transmetalation reactions in organometallic chemistry. This research investigates various precursors and reaction products for the fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions and examines the dependence of these reactions on temperature and other reaction conditions. This research also explores the conformality of the etching process and determines the effect of film structure on the etching. The understanding of these fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions defines a new important family of surface reactions that are important for advanced semiconductor fabrication and has broader impacts on the field. Dr. George involves undergraduate and graduate students in his research and is active in scientific outreach. The results of his research are widely presented at various scientific meetings including the American Vacuum Society (AVS) and Atomic Layer Deposition meetings."

Polymers are long chain organic molecules that derive many of their properties from the entanglements and interactions between the chains.  Polymers have become ubiquitous materials in our daily lives, impacting most industries, including agriculture and food, health and safety, as well as transportation. The modification of polyethylene, the most common of all polymers (187 billion pounds produced in 2014), to include atoms other than carbon and hydrogen can give rise to distinct new material properties, such as enhanced biodegradability, that could extend the applications of this essential polymer class into new arenas.

Professor Carrow is developing a program designed to reach educators from Trenton and Newark area high schools that also includes plans to train graduate students to communicate and interact with people who are not ""fellow experts.""  These schools have a large proportion of students whose ethnicity is underrepresented in the chemistry field, and therefore the plans have a strong component of broadening the participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Carrow is leveraging the flexible structure of chelating phosphine-phosphonic diamide (PPDA) ligands as a platform for systematic studies of alkene migratory insertion reactions involving group 10 metal complexes relevant to catalytic insertion copolymerizations of ethylene with acrylates, carbon monoxide, or carbon dioxide. Insertion polymerization catalysts are strongly inhibited by intramolecular coordination of a functional group within a polymeryl ligand following polar monomer enchainment, which generally depresses catalyst efficiencies below practical thresholds. These limitations have persisted over many years, and fundamental mechanistic insights are still needed for the design of next generation catalysts, particularly those of base metals, with significantly improved activity, molecular weight control, and sequence distribution control. Professor Carrow is developing structure-activity relationships from reactions of palladium and nickel complexes each with a characteristic PPDA ligand to disentangle the ensemble effects of ligand charge, donicity, and steric encumbrance on the rates of stoichiometric reactions involving model catalyst resting state complexes. Parallel studies within a catalytic manifold are correlating these electrostatic, inductive, and steric forces with changes in relative propagation and chain transfer rates involving ethylene and a comonomer, which ultimately dictate the catalyst control over polymer sequence distribution, microstructure, and molecular weight."

This research group has recently shown that this feature is not only important in modulating the structure and properties of nickel-thiolate ligated systems, but can also be involved in reactions such as proton coupled electron transfer reactions.   This research seeks to understand the properties and reactivities of designed nickel containing small molecules and metallopeptide-based systems that contain the protonated nickel-sulfur bond.  A series of spectroscopic, computational, reactivity, and mechanistic studies are undertaken to understand these systems.   Information learned through these studies is used to rationally design systems with fine-tuned electronic and geometric structural properties that can perform specific reactions towards targeted substrates."

Simple ethers find applications as solvents, motor fuel additives, and as precursors to polymeric materials such as plastics and epoxies. Complex ethers are used to synthesize carbohydrates required for modern biochemical applications. A defining characteristic of ethers is their low reactivity. However, this useful property limits options for their further chemical modification and thus, usefulness. With support from the Chemical Catalysis program of the National Science Foundation, this research project is developing new catalytic methods to enable ether reactivity. Professor Schley and his group at Vanderbilt University are exploring new methods for ether activation designed to address challenges unique to the utilization of both simple and complex ethers. The team is enriched by strong connections between Vanderbilt and local community colleges in the greater Nashville area. Professor Schley is organizing an outreach program designed to promote undergraduate research opportunities for community college students. Internship opportunities for current or recent community college graduates to conduct summer research at Vanderbilt University are also being created.<br/><br/>The stability of the ether functional group with respect to attack by oxidants, strong bases, and nucleophiles is a valuable property in many respects, but limits avenues for direct ether derivatization. As a result, despite the availability, affordability, and low toxicity of simple alkyl ethers, they have been primarily limited to low-value applications. Similarly, the harsh stoichiometric methods used for ether C-O cleavage limits compatibility with complex polyether-containing molecules including carbohydrate derivatives. Through this project the Schley research group is exploring two modes for iridium-mediated electrophilic ether activation involving ether dehydrogenation to electrophilic alkoxycarbenes and ether silylation to give silyloxonium ions. These intermediates are activated towards nucleophilic cleavage reactions of the integral carbon-oxygen bond and represent mechanistically distinct routes to selective, catalytic ether cleavage reactions. This research is being pursued in tandem with outreach to local community colleges in the Nashville area. As a former community college student himself, Professor Schley is piloting an outreach program aimed at disseminating information about undergraduate research opportunities for community college students in Tennessee.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tiny capsules are made of polymers (plastics) and are designed to <br/>regulate the uptake and release of bioactive molecules as well as to serve as compartments for containing chemical reactions where the products can be released at will.  Such structures are designed to mimic nature.  They function in a similar way to cells that control biological functions by housing different enzymes and biological molecules in small specialized compartments.  Controlled catch and release functionality of the nanocapsules may lead to new devices for the delivery of drugs and medical imaging agents.  A cell-mimicking device capable of producing a product in response to an external stimulus may find biomedical applications, for example, regulating the production of insulin in response to the level of glucose in the management of diabetes. To facilitate technology transfer and to enhance the educational experience, Professor Pinkhassik provides mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students participating in the technology transfer of their research. In the recent years, several graduate students from the research group have won awards in business plan competitions. Many specific sub-goals of this project are application-driven and suitable for students interested in product development and advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>Vesicle-templated polymer nanocapsules are emerging as a viable platform for creating functional devices with superior performance.  Controlled polymerization of building blocks in the organized environment of self-assembled bilayers enables the synthesis of nanocapsules with nanometer-thin shells containing nanopores with controlled size and chemical environment.  The ease of synthesis coupled with the controlled permeability of the shells and long-term stability of nanocapsules creates an opportunity for building hybrid cell-mimicking nanodevices.

In food science, the crystallinity of starches within potatoes and pasta directly dictate bioavailability of the stored energy content. In renewable energy, biochemical degradation of biomass is greatly affected by the degree of crystallinity. Biomineralization also relies on careful control over crystal phase, often resulting in selection of metastable structures. In pharmaceutical materials, physical solid state form can profoundly affect bioavailability and drug efficacy. Reliably measurement and monitoring of how crystal forms and transforms requires tools capable of reporting crystalline content at low levels. With the support of this grant, Professors Simpson and Bouman work closely with their industrial partners to develop fast and sensitive imaging tools to do just that.  Through close partnership with AbbVie and Formulatrix, the developed approach is expected to bring impacts in pharmaceutical formulations development and other areas, such as pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion and artificial biomineralization.  In addition to working with their undergraduate and graduate students closely on the project, professor Simpson also organizes an intensive summer short-course program on nonlinear optics that more than 160 students have participated in the past ten years. Professor Simpson plans now to produce short videos on the topics discussed at the short course program and makes it available to a much broader audience through YouTube.  <br/><br/>In the present work, Professors Simpson, Bouman, and their groups work on reducing the detection limits of Raman spectroscopy by several orders of magnitude to enable analysis of glassy metastable assemblies, targeting detection limits in the parts per million (ppm) regime. Three complementary approaches are pursued to achieve this objective, all of which center on signal to noise enhancement through background reduction. In the first, SHG is used to rapidly identify regions of interest for targeted Raman analysis, building on the inherent speed and selectivity of SHG for chiral crystals. In addition, a dynamic sampling strategy is adopted for analysis of the SHG-inactive components of formulations, in which spatially sparse sampling informed by the preceding set of outcomes is used for efficient hyperspectral imaging reconstruction. Finally, a spectral sparse sampling strategy for beam-scanning imaging using a photomultiplier tube array allows low-noise measurements for hyperspectral Raman imaging. Complementing these spectral characterization approaches, triboluminescence detection will be developed for fast screening. All efforts greatly benefit from close partnership between collaborators working in pharmaceutical formulations development (AbbVie) and instrumentation companies (Formulatrix) positioned to transition innovations in the research laboratory to viable commercial products. While the primary focus of the work is on metastable systems of relevance to industrial collaborators, the results of this work provides a foundation for expansion to other metastable biological assemblies, including pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion, crystallinity in edible products, and fundamentals of biomineralization.  Professor Simpson organizes a week- long intensive program, Chautauqua on Nonlinear Optics for graduate student from research groups worldwide.

A major challenge for the next decade is to identify viable alternatives to traditional, silicon-based computing.  Such alternatives are needed to   meet the ever-increasing worldwide computational demands in almost all areas of life.  Quantum information processors may be one viable alternative to meet this demand.  By taking advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena, the computational power of quantum computers may exceed by orders of magnitude that of conventional, silicon-based integrated circuits. However, to date quantum information processing is required to operate at ultra-cold temperatures in highly isolated and protected environments.

However, deployment of quantum systems to diverse application arenas has been encumbered by the fragility of quantum states to the ever-present noisy thermal bath, thereby limiting the operation of current quantum devices to cryogenic temperatures.

The structural control and single-molecule addressability of highly programmable DNA nanostructures are leveraged together with synthetic dyes as an engineering platform for quantum-coherent excitonic systems. Controlling the positions and energies of distinct excitonic states using DNA-based scaffolds enables the integration of qubits into higher-order circuits to create multi-qubit systems and devices.

The project involves the study of a newly discovered chemical modification of DNA in bacteria. This modification involves replacement of an oxygen atom in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA with a sulfur atom. The resulting chemical structure is known as a phosphorothioate (PT). The goal of the project is to understand the biological chemistry that is involved in these DNA modifications. The investigators are using chemical tools to examine the biochemistry of PT modification to bacterial DNA. The importance of this project is two-fold. First, the results advance the understanding of an important and fundamental new feature of microbial physiology known as epigenetics. The studies are significant for their practical impact as well. They contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which DNA-modifying enzymes find their DNA targets. The project findings can be exploited to develop new tools for biotechnology and synthetic biology research. The new tools can be used for enhancing the productivity of industrial microorganisms. The project provides cutting-edge interdisciplinary training at the interface of chemistry and biology. Training is provided for high school, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. The project also develops novel epigenetics educational materials and curricula for high school science classes and teacher workshops.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to understand the biological chemistry of redox-sensitive sulfur-containing DNA modifications widespread in bacteria: phosphorothioates (PT). As a widespread epigenetic mark in all bacterial genera, PTs are incorporated into DNA by a 5-member dnd gene cluster (dndA-E). This gene cluster inserts S in place of a non-bridging oxygen in the DNA backbone as a sequence-specific PT. PTs function in restriction-modification (R-M) systems in many bacteria with Dnd proteins F-H. They are also present in bacteria lacking restriction genes, which suggests non-R-M epigenetic functions in gene expression. One highly unusual feature of PTs is that only 12-14% of short consensus sequences are modified in the genome. This fact raises questions about how the enzymes find their targets. The studies explore PT dynamics and function with the use of innovative sequencing, genomics, informatics and analytical technologies. The project uses a novel chemical cleavage/nick translation sequencing technology. Single-molecule real-time sequencing is used to quantify changes in PT location in response to oxidative stress and cell growth. The problem of genomic target selection is addressed by mining existing genomic maps of PTs relative to genomic landmarks. In addition, PT location is correlated with binding sites for Dnd proteins using ChIP-seq to map protein binding sites in the bacterial genomes. The mechanism of target selection by Dnd restriction enzymes is addressed by mapping restriction-induced cleavage sites in bacterial genomes.

Professors Billiot and Billiot of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, Kevin Morris of Carthage College, and Yayin Fang of Howard University form a multi-institutional collaboration. The work focuses on the investigation and elucidation of the factors responsible for molecular self-assembly, and how these factors affect the ability of the self-assembled molecular structures to interact and recognize other molecules of biological importance. A variety of experimental and computational methods are used to developed Quantitative Structure Enantioselective Retention Relationships (QSERR). QSERR is then used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different chiral selectors for capillary electrophoretic separations. Two of the three institutions are primarily undergraduate institutions that currently do not have a master's program in chemistry. Thus, the research will be conducted at these two schools exclusively by undergraduate students. One of these is also a Hispanic Serving Institution. The third university involved in the research is an HBCU. The research serves as a tool for the PIs to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds and to encourage these students to pursue post baccalaureate degrees in science.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is part of an ongoing, long-term multi-faceted study focusing on investigating and elucidating the factors responsible for (a) self-assembly, (b) function, (c) higher ordered structure and (d) molecular recognition of amino acid based macromolecular assemblies (AABMAs). In particular, the research will focus on examining the effects that pH, ionic strength, surfactant concentration, and type of counter-ion have on the factors mentioned above. These AABMAs are being utilized in this study as chiral pseudostationary phases in capillary electrophoresis. Thus, the major focus of these studies is to gain insights into the factors responsible for chiral recognition with this class of chiral selector. A deeper understanding of these factors will lead to enhanced chiral separations and improved pseudostationary phases. Understanding such interactions is not only important in the development of chiral recognition media but also in the optimization of the separation conditions. In addition, since enantiorecognition of the systems under study are amino acids, the knowledge gained from these studies will be potentially transferable to other amino acid based systems such as proteins."

Lipids are water-repellant molecules that, in biological systems, can act as energy stores, major constituents of cellular membranes, and intracellular signaling molecules. In the latter capacity, signaling lipids such as phosphatidic acid function as second messengers that cause cells to change their metabolism, gene expression, and behavior in response to diverse extracellular stimuli. To elucidate how the locations within the cell where phosphatidic acid is produced relates to each different physiological outcome, it is critical to be able to visualize and perturb the production of this key signaling lipid. The proposed research describes chemical and biochemical tools to both report on and control phosphatidic acid synthesis, as well as their application to study an important signaling pathway thought to be under the control of this lipid. This research to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry and biochemistry of lipids integrates with an educational plan that entails hands-on outreach activities on lipids and biomembranes targeted at underserved populations in middle and high school, to increase awareness of and interest in science in young women and underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>The lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid can, depending on the context, stimulate protein kinases to cause cell growth and proliferation, polymerization of actin to promote cell migration, and vesicle budding to increase protein secretion. It remains a mystery how one lipid signal can cause such diverse physiological events. The main impediment to dissecting the varied functional consequences of phosphatidic acid is a lack of tools to visualize and modulate its production with spatiotemporal control. The research objectives of this proposal are to develop a chemical method to image intracellular sites of phosphatidic acid production within live cells, to develop a chemoenzymatic strategy to enable production of phosphatidic acid on demand at precise, subcellular locations within live cells, and to apply these tools to probe mechanistic questions about the role of phosphatidic acid at lysosomes in orchestrating cell growth pathways. This work will generate both new methodologies for studying lipid signaling and fundamental knowledge into how a single lipid signaling agent can direct precise cellular signaling outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All living systems require RNA to be processed into different molecular forms. Genome sequencing has identified a family of proteins called 'non-classical' zinc finger (ZF) proteins that play key roles in regulating RNA.  Two proteins from this family, TTP and CPS30, are investigated in vitro and in cells to determine how zinc binding affects RNA processing. These studies help define general principles of metal directed protein RNA regulation in living systems and identify how toxic metals disrupt these fundamental biological processes.  Graduate student participants receive training at the interface of chemistry and biology using cutting edge experimental techniques.  A successful outreach program called SIMSI developed by the PI with a women's college in Baltimore, which provides mini-graduate school experiences and mentoring continues. In addition, a new outreach workshop called ""Minding Your Metals"" that draws inspiration form the Flint, MI drinking water crisis is developed for underrepresented minority (URM) students from three Baltimore City urban public middle schools. Graduate students are involved in all outreach efforts, and will be trained in communicating findings and conveying scientific principles to audiences with different levels of science knowledge. <br/><br/>This proposal is focused on the CCCH class of non-classical zinc finger (ZF) proteins. Two CCCH ZFs, tristetraprolin (TTP) and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30) are investigated. TTP is a key player in the regulation of inflammation, when reactive oxygen species are elevated, and outstanding questions include the roles of metal ions (native and toxic), and the participation of reactive oxygen species and reactive sulfur species in the structure and function of TTP. CPSF30 is involved in pre- mRNA processing, and contains a 2Fe-2S cluster, in addition to zinc sites. The PI (1) determines how metal ions, reactive oxygen species and reactive sulfur species modulate TTP function in vitro and in cells and (2) determines the mechanism of RNA recognition for CPSF30 by deciphering the functional roles of the 2Fe-2S cluster, the CCCH domains and the CCHC domain. Biochemical, biophysical, structural and cell based approaches are taken, including fluorescence anisotropy to measure protein/RNA binding, native ESI-MS and ICP-MS to determine stoichiometry, cryo-ESI-MS to elucidate reactivity with reactive oxygen and sulfur species, HDX/MS and crosslinking/ESI-MS to identify structural changes upon RNA binding, and cellular reporter assays to translate in vitro findings to cells."

Pierce at The University of Texas at Arlington will investigate the factors influencing the extent of biological oxidations.  The proposed activities provide an opportunity to better understand structural factors driving biological oxidations and thus provide a framework for the rational design of biologically-inspired or bioengineered oxidation catalysts.  Oxidations result in a net transfer of electrons from the initial molecule (or substrate) to molecular oxygen.  From an accounting point of view, the ""extent"" of an oxidation can be defined as the number of electrons transferred.  It has been previously noted that changes in structure around iron dramatically influence the extent of substrate oxidation by catalysts.  The proposed biochemical studies utilize an iron catalyst to compare the factors directing 2- and 6-electron oxidations within a single, simplified platform.  Beyond training for graduate/undergraduate students in biochemistry, biophysics and chemical catalysis, broader impact activities for this award include training and practical experience in scientific communication for the PI and students (undergraduate and graduate) participating in NSF-supported activities. <br/><br/>Non-heme diiron enzymes are a ubiquitous family of enzymes capable of catalyzing an amazing diversity of biological oxidations.  Among these enzymes, it has been observed that single amino acid perturbations within the first Fe-coordination sphere have a profound impact on the nature of transient intermediates produced following O2-activation and the extent of substrate oxidation.  For example, within the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase (BMM) superfamily, the hydroxylase component diiron site is coordinated by 2-histidine and 4-carboxylate (Asp or Glu) residues [2-His/4-carboxylate].  The reduced (diferrous) active sites of these enzymes are capable of reductively activating molecular oxygen to catalyze the 2-electron oxidation of its specific substrate.  By contrast, a small number of enzymes have been identified which contain an additional His-residue coordinated to one of the two Fe-sites; resulting in a [3-His/4-carboxlate] diiron cluster.  Among these are the arylamine N-oxygenase class of non-heme diiron enzymes AurF and CmlI.  These enzymes catalyze a remarkable 6-electron oxidation of arylamine  substrates to yield a nitroaryl product.  The proposed studies utilize an unusual non-heme tRNA-hydroxylase isolated from S. typhimurium (St MiaE) to compare the relevant factors directing (6-electron) arylamine N-oxygenase and (2-electron) monooxygenase chemistry within a single, enzymatic platform.  This comparison is made possible by a single amino acid substitution (L199H) within the St MiaE active site which yields a [3-His/4-carboxylate] first Fe-coordination sphere and imparts 6-electron arylamine N-oxygenase activity.

Species in the Corynebacterineae have two membranes, the outermost of which is composed mostly of complex sugar-linked lipids called mycolic acid conjugates. This ""mycomembrane"" is unique to the Corynebacterineae and gives them distinctive physiological and pathogenic characteristics. Many aspects of the production, maintenance, and composition of the mycomembrane remain unknown because of the challenges encountered when using standard experimental techniques.

The tools being developed form a significant part of the process of acquiring a better understanding of how the Corynebacterineae survive within and adapt to their surrounding environment. In addition, an investigation of this bacterial system advances understanding of the nature of interactions of bacteria with the environment and provides information that would enhance efforts to gain environmental control of pathogens. Undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows working on this research acquire interdisciplinary training in organic synthesis, microbiology and proteomics.

Lipids are major building blocks of cellular membranes and a subclass of these biomolecules control cellular functions by attracting proteins to distinct cellular sites at specific times. Such lipid mediated signaling events require a high degree of organization in space and time, and deviations from the proper execution of these signaling pathways result in a wide array of cellular dysfunctions. The cellular requirements for the local accumulation of signaling lipids are only beginning to emerge and the mechanisms leading to the time dependent control of these lipid pools need to be determined. The research funded under this proposal will delineate the mechanisms that lead to the formation and maintenance of localized pools and gradients of signaling lipids. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in many modern research techniques, including single molecule microscopy. The principal investigator will continue to develop inquiry based middle school science projects and his research group will be involved in a range of STEM outreach activities. <br/><br/>The impact of the research will be to understand how phosphoinositides, which are minority components of plasma and intracellular membranes, provide spatiotemporal control of protein function.

These radicals are slowed with a series of decelerator electrodes using a new type of continuous-wave decelerator developed in the Lewandowski laboratory.  The slowed molecules enter an ion trap (e.g. a linear Paul trap), where they interact with a population of cooled ions.  Diagnostics are performed (optical imaging of the ions, destructive time-of-flight mass spectrometry of products, etc.)   Ions to be studied include the following: singly-ionized species: acetylene, ammonia, methane, hydroxyl (OH+), and methylidyne (CH+).  The Lewandowski research group includes active involvement by undergraduates in authentic research.  In addition to her experimental work, Prof. Lewandowski works with ALPhA and postdoctoral fellows from the Physics Education group at University of Colorado to develop and run a workshop to assist significant numbers of higher-education faculty members in incorporating modeling into the educators' own laboratory curriculum."

Levine of Michigan State University is developing new computational methods to model non-radiative recombination in semiconductor nanomaterials.  Non-radiative recombination is a fundamental process that converts electronic energy to heat, thus limiting the efficiencies of devices for solar energy conversion, light emission, and other applications.  The methods being developed provide an atom-by-atom, electron-by-electron mechanistic picture of this process, thus informing the design of future materials.  Specifically, the Levine group is applying these new theoretical models to elucidate the dynamics of electronically excited silicon nanoparticles, which show promise as light emitters for solid state displays, biological imaging, and solid state lasers. The Levine group is also working with local high school teachers to develop the High School Computational Chemistry Server (HiSoCCS), which freely serves research-grade computational chemistry capability via a user-friendly web-based interface.  HiSoCCS and associated curricular materials are made available for free to Michigan high schools.  <br/><br/>The Levine group's approach is based on the hypothesis that conical intersections, points of degeneracy between electronic states, are introduced by defects in the material, and that these intersections provide efficient pathways for non-radiative recombination.  A new fully quantum mechanical method for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, the diabatized Gaussians on adiabatic surfaces (DGAS) approximation, is being developed.  The DGAS wave function ansatz is designed to handle singularities in the first- and second-derivative nonadiabatic couplings that occur at conical intersections.  The DGAS method is being implemented for high performance parallel computers, and the resulting software will be made freely available to other scientists.  The broader impacts of this work include: a) the development of a new nonadiabatic molecular dynamics method capable of accurately modeling a wide range non-radiative processes, b) new open source software for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, c) a deeper understanding of non-radiative recombination in silicon nanomaterials, and d) new tools and materials that incorporate research grade calculations into the high school science curriculum."

The goal of this research is to design a system of 2-dimensional cyclic  structures to form 3-dimensional cylinders that can improve light absorption and direction for electron transfer.  The project uses a process called self-assembly, where the synthetic color molecules (porphyrins) spontaneously form the desired 3D architectures by mixing of carefully chosen components. Further, the project utilizes water (an abundant and non-toxic liquid) as the medium for the reaction.  In addition to increasing our fundamental understanding of molecular assembly and light-collection, this project also includes an outreach component that focuses on enhancing the interest of K-12 students in chemistry and science.  <br/><br/>The construction of defined 3D cylinders composed of multiple rungs of 2D cyclic chromophore arrays is attractive for photonic applications since such 3D architectures may provide enhanced light absorption, and directionality for excitation energy transfer (EET).  The porphyrin rings can be packed densely onto functional solid substrates. The research team synthesizes the components and then studies the assembly of the cylinders in water. The strategy harnesses an array of supramolecular assembly modes, including cation-induced guanosine or isoguanosine oligonucleotide hybridization to form cylindrical quadruplexes and pentaplexes. Importantly, the researchers propose to position unique chromophores at specific sites along the cylinders to achieve directional EET.  The light-harvesting porphyrins are precluded from undergoing detrimental self-stacking and thus exhibit superior photophysical properties. These properties are analyzed via steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements that are conducted in collaboration with the Rubtsov and Schmehl research groups. The outreach plan includes a service-learning course pioneered by Professor Jayawickramarajah and focuses on undergraduates from Tulane conducting chemistry-centered service learning activities at inner-city New Orleans public schools."

The principal challenges in producing artificial electron transfer cascades are first to create well-defined donor/acceptor pairs and second to place additional acceptors with progressively lower LUMOs at precise positions so that their energy gradient leads to spatial separation of the initially created charge pair.  The cascades are being constructed starting with amphiphilic, water-soluble pi-conjugated polymers that assemble into networks of electrically-interconnected micelles. The conjugated polyelectrolytes are then assembled with charged C60 derivatives or other pi-conjugated acceptors.  The structure of the assembly and the energetics of both the polymer donor and the pi-conjugated electron acceptor are being tuned.  The electron transfer cascades are being characterized using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and the structures are being correlated with the observed photochemical properties.

One common transformation is an oxidation reaction, where oxygen is added to or electrons are removed from a molecule. Oxidation reactions often rely on toxic reagents that produce a large amount of waste.  The use of molecular oxygen could reduce both the cost of these reactions and the amount of waste produced. Molecular oxygen is also abundant in air.  Scientists generally do not know how to use atmospheric oxygen to transform molecules into desired products. In this project, Dr. McCormick of Portland State University and Drs. Detty and Cook of the University at Buffalo are investigating dyes that can use energy from light to make desirable molecular transformations with atmospheric oxygen. By understanding how changing the structure of a dye influences its reactivity, it may be possible to control and target these oxidation reactions. Drs. McCormick, Detty, and Cook are dedicated to increasing education in areas of sustainability via the implementation of new courses. They provide research internships to students to increase their awareness of the impact of development on the environment and their role as scientists in creating sustainable solutions.  The curriculum revisions may increase student engagement in issues of sustainability and photochemistry. The modules are disseminated to allow schools across the country to adopt the curriculum, which focuses on on principles of green chemistry, environmental protection, and renewable energy.

McCormick, Detty, and Cook are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate chalcogen-containing dyes as photosensitizers for photocatalytic redox reactions.

The interchange of the chalcogen atoms (O, S, or Se to Te) in the xanthylium or pyrylium core of the dyes allows control of redox behavior in the dyes, as well as wavelengths of absorption, fluorescence yields and lifetimes, and triplet yields and lifetimes. The chalcogen-containing dyes function as photo-oxidants in that the excited state can accept an electron to give a one-electron oxidation of a substrate. The excited state can also intersystem-cross from singlet to triplet and then interact with ground-state oxygen to generate singlet-oxygen, which can function as a potent oxidant.  This research may result in a decreased reliance on fossil fuels by providing a route to hydrogen peroxide production, decreasing carbon emissions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significantly, these dearomatization reactions are leading to new molecules with considerable stereochemical complexity that are well suited for biological evaluation. Previously, heavy metal dearomatization agents derived from osmium, rhenium, and tungsten have been investigated, exploiting their powerful pi-donating abilities.

Fundamental chemical features of molybdenum-based aromatic complexes are being investigated and compared to the analogous heavy metal systems. Differences in bond energies, oxidation state stabilities, pi-interactions, tolerance of chemical reagents, cost, and recyclability are ultimately leading to new synthetic opportunities that complement those provided by the heavy metal based systems.  The molecular frameworks that are formed through these studies are providing novel architectures that ultimately will be valuable in the development of new biologically active materials.

The two metals work cooperatively to achieve much more efficient catalysis than that of a single metal. Understanding how this process occurs is enabling the application of this strategy to a broad number of catalytic reactions.

Traditional ligand design in transition metal catalysis seeks to control reaction mechanism, reactivity, and catalyst lifetime by varying the electronic and steric properties of organic supporting ligands. Ligands that contain a second metal represent a conceptually distinct approach to catalyst design because metal-metal cooperativity can impact the reactivity, mechanism, and selectivity of catalysts in unique ways. Despite significant efforts to synthesize and characterize bimetallic complexes, their application to organic synthesis remains relatively unexplored.   In addition, it remains unclear to what extent metal-metal interactions can enable mechanistically distinct reaction pathways.

These goals are being achieved by (1) synthesizing new titanium-containing ligands, including chiral enantiopure ligands, and investigating the assembly of electrophilic Ti-M (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) heterobimetallic catalysts for olefin and C-H activation reactions, and (2) Synthesizing (NHC)Ni-M2 complexes (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) and investigating the impact of M2 in Ni-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Dr. Michaelis is also actively involved in STEM outreach activities, including high school and undergraduate research internships, and is developing a freshman mentoring program for chemistry and biochemistry majors. This mentoring program is ensuring that a diverse group of undergraduate students participate in undergraduate research, outreach, and service opportunities within the STEM field."

However, the compounds most easily extracted from biomass are quite different from conventional hydrocarbons obtained from processing petroleum or shale. One major difference is that most biomass-derived compounds are smaller than hydrocarbon fuels, necessitating catalytic reactions to build larger molecules from the original compounds. In these reactions, the catalyst is a solid film comprising chemicals that aid the efficiency of the reaction, but are not themselves consumed in the reaction.  Drs. Hohn and Higgins are studying one such reaction, aldol condensation, to understand what catalytic properties are best suited to this task. To accomplish this, they follow a light-emitting reaction occurring on a catalyst film that they create with a gradient of catalytic properties along the film surface. Observing which parts of the film emit the brightest light provides information on the types of catalytic sites that are most active and allows the team to design improved catalysts. Research results are being disseminated in several ways, including through presentations at scientific conferences and peer reviewed publications. Dr. Hohn is also incorporating research results into outreach activities for K-12 students, while Dr. Higgins is introducing research results into a textbook on microscopy and into a graduate-level chemistry class.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Hohn and Higgins of Kansas State University are developing a fundamental understanding of the catalytic properties responsible for activity in aldol condensation. They are applying single molecule methods to simultaneously measure acid/base properties and aldol condensation activity on thin films incorporating gradients in acid/base site densities. With these measurements, they are correlating catalytic activity in aldol condensation with the strengths and densities of the acid/base sites. The team applies surface characterization methods, including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman mapping studies, to augment the single molecule characterization studies. In addition, Drs. Hohn and Higgins correlate catalytic activity in aldol condensation with acid/base site proximity by preparing films with acid and base sites mixed at the molecular level and films where acid and base sites are separated by macroscopic distances. Along with regular publication of the results in the peer reviewed literature and presentation at conferences, Dr. Hohn is incorporates aspects of the research into activities for outreach programs at Kansas State University to enhance the recruitment of students from under-represented groups into science and engineering, while Dr. Higgins is introducing selected results into a graduate-level course and a textbook on chemical microscopy."

Professor Yoon is interested in the ""chirality"", or ""handedness"", of small organic molecules. Many important organic molecules, including drug molecules and biologically important molecules like amino acids and sugars can exist in either left- or right-handed forms, with only one form being biologically desirable. The undesirable form can be harmful, so almost all new drug-candidates or diagnostic probes must be of only one ""handedness"". Light can also be produced with either left- or right-handed circular polarizations. The long-term goal of this project is to use the handedness of circularly polarized light to dictate the handedness of a small organic molecule. This is accomplished by designing helically chiral catalysts that can first be selectively activated by circularly polarized light with only one handedness and then transferring that handedness to a chemical reaction and its resultant product. This project requires an interdisciplinary approach that combines synthetic organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, photochemistry, and computational chemistry to achieve its objectives, and in that way it provides outstanding training for students. Professor Yoon is also a leader in efforts to increase the diversity of students who undertake careers in science, and the project includes broader impacts that continue these important efforts. <br/><br/>The chiral photocatalysts studied in this project are octahedral iridium complexes whose ligands are arranged about the metal with well-defined helical chirality.  This class of compounds constitutes an attractive starting point for these studies because they possess a robust and well-studied photochemistry, because they have been recently shown to be quite effective photosensitizers for a range of organic transformations, and because they can easily be synthesized in stereochemically pure form.  The first phase of this project shows that the chirality of a single enantiomer of a helically chiral iridium photocatalyst can be transmitted to a newly formed organic photocycloadduct.  The second phase seeks understanding of the structure-activity relationships necessary for effective enantioselective photocatalysis.  The third and most ambitious phase attempts to identify orthogonal structural features that enable selective activation of a racemic mixture of chiral Ir photocatalysts with circularly polarized light. The broader impacts of this project train a diverse set of graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge synthetic organic chemistry relevant to the construction of potential new drugs, materials, and fine chemicals."

The research benefits from collaboration and student exchanges with a research team at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) in Nantes, France.  The tools being developed help answer important questions about the structure and function of biological molecules including, but not limited to, oligosaccharides.  The new instruments can address, for example, questions about how sugars are digested, the gelling properties of food-grade pectins, and cell recognition pathways in living systems.

Initial efforts seek to improve fragmentation efficiency by incorporating additional ion optics in the reactant ion beam.  This modification may also reduce reaction times, enabling CTD to be coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic separations of complex mixtures.  Instrument variables such as reagent ion kinetic energy, flux, and electron affinity (through the choice of noble gas); CTD reaction time; and the trapping parameter (qz) are optimized to enhance fragmentation behavior.  Key aims are the elucidation of general rules for fragmentation and identification of the best conditions with which to augment oligosaccharide characterization.  Isolated fractions of well-characterized oligosaccharides are used to elucidate the effect of oligosaccharide properties on the extent and nature of fragmentation.  Properties expected to influence glycosidic and cross-ring fragmentation mechanisms include: glycan sequence, inter-residue linkage position, branching point, charge state, adducting ions, and glycan modifications such as esterification, amination and sulfation.  Additional studies investigate the efficacy of CTD towards other oxygenated oligomers, including polymers, PEGylated drugs, anionic surfactants and oligonucleotides.  These combined studies demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of CTD relative to existing technologies and help guide future research towards high-impact applications."

Anions and cations are ubiquitous, and have diverse structures, properties, and functions. Some play important roles in biological, chemical, industrial, and environmental processes, while others are toxic and pollutants. For these reasons, it is important to regulate these charged species with high precision and selectivity. Selective ion receptors  can provide scientists with systems that are recyclable, reusable, and better suited for applications in environmental protection. The graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral researchers working on this project will gain an array of scientific knowledge and technical expertise, from synthesis to molecular recognition.

To discriminate anions in aprotic solvents, the Saha research team is exploiting the ability of -acidic naphthalenediimide (NDI) receptors to accept electron(s) from strong Lewis basic anions, form charge-transfer complexes with less basic anions, and engage in anion? and CHanion interactions with charge-diffuse anions. To overcome the ion-pairing effect that weakens the binding interactions between ionic guests and receptors, tweezers-shaped, ditopic ion-pair receptors are being developed by tethering two terminal NDI units with folded linkers that can bind cations. The hypothesis is that cation binding at the linker units should facilitate anion binding between the two overlapping NDI units and vice versa. During biphasic extractions, these ditopic receptors should selectively extract salts that contain less hydrated charge-diffuse anions from aqueous to organic medium, while the more hydrated hard anions should remain in water. NDI-based cationic metallacycles are being constructed to capture large charge-diffuse anions inside their cavities through anion/NDI interactions. The metal ion corners should mitigate the ion-pairing effects. The reversible redox chemistry of the NDI units and the tendency of their reduced forms to expel anions offer a new approach to release the captured anions from these receptors upon chemical, electrochemical, and/or photochemical reduction."

Shale gas is mostly methane, which is difficult to transport and of relatively low value. The conversion of methane into higher value products, such as methanol, requires new and improved catalytic processes. Methanol is a platform chemical, with existing technologies for transforming it into a variety of useful, important products. Metal exchanged zeolites are a class of materials showing great promise as catalysts for transforming methane to methanol. However, how these catalysts work is not yet well-understood. Further, their catalytic performance depends on many complex parameters which are difficult to optimize. In this project, Dr. Mavrikakis of the University of Wisconsin is using both theory and experiments to understand the performance of one specific zeolite structure, known as SSZ-13, for the conversion of methane to methanol. His work is developing a correlation between zeolite synthesis conditions and the resulting chemical composition of SSZ-13, and between its catalytic performance and reaction conditions. The insights gained are being used to design experimental synthesis protocol to produce the ideal zeolite catalyst and reaction conditions for methane conversion to methanol. During this project Dr. Mavrikakis is informing the public about the importance of theoretical modeling in fundamental and industrial research and practice. Dr. Mavrikakis is also educating undergraduate students about communicating science to middle school and high school students, as well as providing internships to undergraduate students to conduct research in his group.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Mavrikakis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is applying a combined theoretical/experimental approach for understanding the fundamentals of converting methane to methanol using transition metal exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite. This includes: (i) first-principles modeling of zeolite synthesis through the development of correlations between synthesis parameters, such as the identity of template and ions present, and the obtained zeolite structure, such as the local Al distribution and defect density; (ii) the ab-initio calculation of phase diagrams for different transition metals (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni) and types of active sites for a wide range of operating conditions, and (iii) the calculation of reaction pathways for the most stable active catalytic sites. In a subsequent step, this information is being used to develop a protocol for the experimental synthesis, elemental composition and reaction conditions for maximized performance of the ideal metal exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite for the conversion of methane to methanol. In parallel, and in collaboration with the Wisconsin Institute for Chemical Education, Dr. Mavrikakis' group is developing modules to teach undergraduate and middle school students how thinking at the molecular level can lead to new powerful technologies. Furthermore, the P.I. is participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduates program at UW Madison, which is providing hands-on research experiences to undergraduate researchers with a focus on female students and students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor S. Alex Kandel of the University of Notre Dame is exploring how molecules crystallize from solution. The insights gained from the project are advancing our understanding of materials science, as well as have far-reaching commercial implications in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.  The project includes training of graduate students, and involvement of undergraduate and high-school students in scientific research.<br/><br/>Molecular clusters and crystals are formed by injecting microliter-sized droplets of solutions containing small organic molecules into vacuum. As the solvent evaporates, solid structures are formed, deposited onto clean substrates, and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).  The deposition method captures a range of geometries and molecular configurations, not just the structures near the thermodynamic minimum-free-energy state. The ability to characterize multiple metastable structures provides detailed insight into the complex potential surface created by several interacting functional groups on two or more molecules.  The experimental approach compares a range of chemically similar systems to determine how, for a given molecule, each specific functional group contributes to the intermolecular interactions that ultimately control the formation of clusters and larger structures.

This project seeks to understand the fundamental steps that take place on ultrafast (femtosecond to picosecond) time scales after a transition metal complex absorbs a photon of light. New ruthenium complexes are designed, synthesized and studied to determine how their excited state processes and photochemistry depend on variation in structure. Transition metal complexes studied in this research are important in applications that range from solar energy conversion to the delivery of drugs for phototherapy. This collaborative team is also well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to understand the basic principles that govern the photophysical processes in ruthenium II complexes at early times, including the factors that control efficient photosubstitution and dual-activity compounds. New ruthenium complexes are designed, synthesized and studied to test theories about how variation in structure affects photochemistry and photophysics.  The mechanism by which two different photoactive states are populated in these ruthenium complexes remains unknown and is counter to the rules of photochemistry developed for organic molecules. Photoinduced ligand release using ruthenium II complexes is highly dependent on the identity of both the leaving and ancillary ligands.  One hypothesis being tested to explain this structural dependence is that fast population of the metal-centered ligand field state is required for ligand exchange to take place.  It is yet unknown if this occurs through direct intersystem crossing from the singlet manifold or from a vibrationally hot triplet state. The basic knowledge gained regarding photoinduced ligand exchange also aids in the design of complexes that eliminate the exchange process in order to increase the lifetime of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer state.  This is an important factor in solar energy conversion. The project also focuses on the design and synthesis of new complexes that release a wider range of ligands through irradiation with visible or low energy near-infrared light. Transition metal complexes studied in this research have potential applications that include solar energy conversion and phototherapy.

It is weak interactions that cause atoms and molecules stick to each other without actually forming chemical bonds.  Weak interactions include hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, and London dispersion forces. These computations complement ongoing experimental investigations ranging from fundamental studies of solvation to the design, synthesis and characterization of new molecules, nano-scale assemblies and materials.

The research program of Prof. Vaidhyanathan Ramamurthy at University of Miami focuses on fundamental understanding of the properties of molecules in confined space and exploring the use of light to initiate reactions in water.  The long-term goal is to address the national needs in sustainability by developing efficient methods for capturing and converting sunlight (a sustainable source of energy) into chemical energy through transformations in water (that avoids environmental issues associated with the use of organic solvents).  This interdisciplinary project involving domestic and international collaborations provides research training to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

Common examples of useful surfactants are soaps and detergents.  As a result of the different solubilities of the headgroup and the tail, surfactants spontaneously form ordered assemblies in water.  The assemblies can range from very simple spheres dispersed in water to much more sophisticated geometries.  However, predicting the geometry of a complex assembly from the chemical structure of the surfactant remains a significant challenge.  Motivated by the desire to control surfactant assembly and access complex structures with unusual and useful properties, Prof. Mahesh Mahanthappa and his research team at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities seek to understand how surfactant structure dictates the packing geometry and the stability of an assembly.  Their discoveries could have broad implications for the future design and development of surfactants for applications such as enhanced oil recovery, personal care product formulation, drug encapsulation, and therapeutic delivery.  The project also contributes to the interdisciplinary research training of undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented groups.  Public outreach demonstrations using visually appealing soap bubble froths showcase the properties of surfactants and help to arouse the interest of students in science.<br/><br/>A delicate balance of non-covalent interactions drives the supramolecular assembly of minimally hydrated amphiphiles into different lyotrophic liquid-crystalline phases.  Of particular interest is the complex Frank-Kasper (FK) phases, which apparently arise from a frustrated non-covalent force balance that minimizes local variations in amphiphile solvation, while maximizing global micelle cohesion across the supramolecular assembly.  Specific experiments of this project aim to 1) understand how the ionic amphiphile tail structure, counterion symmetry, and chirality impact micellar aggregation and consequent packing of the micelles into high coordination number, low symmetry lattices; 2) evaluate whether these complex packings are long-lived metastable states or thermodynamic equilibrium phases; and 3) assess whether non-ionic amphiphiles might form these complex phases.  An important goal is to uncover new molecular design criteria that drive the formation of lyotropic liquid crystals with exceptional translational order, at length scales far exceeding those of their constituent molecular and supramolecular micelle building blocks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research activities provide foundational knowledge about electron transfer and new types of exciplexes.  Substances which form exciplexes have potential applications as sensors, as biological probes, and in organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Due to their solubility in water, cationic exciplexes have enhanced potential for development of biological imaging applications. The research provides a rich educational experience for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, in  synthesis, electrochemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy.

This group is underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>This project investigates two types of novel, charge transfer exciplex intermediates that were recently discovered in the Dinnocenzo laboratory. One type of exciplex is formed by reaction of cationic, excited state acceptors with neutral donors. Research objectives include determining the electronic nature of the exciplexes (e.g. electronic coupling matrix elements) through theoretical fitting of radiative lifetimes, which are determined by Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) and fluorescence spectra. This project expands the generality of cationic exciplexes by measuring some of their photophysical properties, examining cationic exciplexes in a variety of media (including water), and synthesizing intramolecular examples. A related project investigates examples uncovered in the Professor Dinnocenzo's lab where two exciplex emissions are observed from a single acceptor and donor. Preliminary results are consistent with dramatically different solvent reorganization energies for the two types of exciplexes, indicating major differences in their structures. In this research, students learn how to synthesize, purify, and spectroscopically characterize compounds.

A primary objective of this research is to develop fundamental relationships between the shapes and functionalities of structurally simple molecular gelators and the properties of their gels. To do so, two fundamental scientific questions are being addressed: ""What constitutes an efficient molecular gelator?"" and ""How can the gelator structures be designed to provide materials with rather unique structural and mechanical properties?"" The results from this research are expected to contribute information that is important to both basic and applied science and to fill current large gaps of understanding between molecular structure and self-assembly that lead to a wide range of self-organized materials in addition to gels.  Several of the gels may be useful in applications that include art conservation, oil recovery, and food chemistry.  Another very important impact is the training of young scientists, including those<br/>in under-represented groups and from developing countries. Students at all levels--postdoctoral to high school- are given opportunities to become integrated within the scientific community by attending and presenting their research results at conferences and by interacting directly with students in other collaborating labs throughout the world.<br/><br/>The gelators selected are commercially available (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Ethomeen surfactants, and polyethylenimines) or naturally occurring (e.g., sphingosine, glucamine, and 12-hydroxystearic acid) molecules.  Alternatively, the gelators are easily synthesized from related molecules. Solvents that are most appropriate complements to the gelators are pre-selected using Hansen or other parameter sets that dissect liquid properties.  The gels are designed to provide 'exceptional' properties, such as high degrees of thixotropy with variable recovery rates after destructive shear, gel-to-gel transitions initiated by thermally and photochemically induced changes of the molecular packing within gel fibers, and isothermal sol<->gel transitions induced by adding or removing a neutral triatomic gas (such as CO2).

Understanding this relationship is crucial for design of unique surfaces of better bio compatibility and the coatings for corrosion protection and lubrication. The goal of this work is to develop improved tools for measurement and analysis with high precision.

Despite the remarkable resolution, accurate measurements are complicated by the image distortion inherent in the STM. Recent advances in image post-processing by the Bumm group can remove this distortion to a level where accurate real-space measurements to be achieved. This project builds on that success and develops new advanced image analysis methods to characterize motion of molecules in sequences of images. The project develops and tests these methods on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)--a 2D crystalline organic film, one molecule thick. SAMs are widely used in many areas of science and technology. Although they are well studied, many fundamental questions remain concerning their structure and properties. The analysis methods being developed can measure the position of each molecule in the image to better than 30 pm. Analysis methods to study point defects introduced into SAMs are to be developed and applied to fundamental characteristics of SAMs difficult to perform in other ways.

Nature has optimized the mechanism of photosynthesis to absorb and harvest solar energy by transforming carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate fuels. Yet, this apparently simple transformation of carbon dioxide and water - the most ubiquitous chemicals on earth - to a sustainable fuel source still represents one of the grand challenges of science today. In this project, Dr. Rochford of University of Massachusetts Boston learns from nature and develops a next generation of molecular catalysts that can mimic photosynthesis to efficiently transform carbon dioxide and water into useful fuels. Just as we are strongly influenced by our own environment in a macroscopic world, the behavior and properties of carbon dioxide and water are also very sensitive to their local environment at a molecular scale.  Dr. Rochford and his students utilize ""self-assembly"" techniques, inspired by photosynthesis, to leverage the environmental sensitivity of carbon dioxide and water to optimize their sustainable transformation into fuels.

Significant intellectual merit is achieved by targeting first-row Mn(I)-based transition metal catalysts whereby tailoring the second- and outer-coordination sphere of the ligand, transition-state energies is optimized to promote proton-coupled electron transfer, thus reducing activation energies for critical rate-determining steps to maximize catalyst turnover frequencies, and reduce the minimum required overpotential. Dr. Rochford and his students develop cutting-edge catalyst design methods, from synthesis to self-assembly, combined with tailored electrochemical analyses, which impacts on a host of research areas that employ nanostructured and electroactive surfaces. Success in this area informs the chemical catalysis community to better design, control and optimize first-row transition metal catalysts for selective carbon dioxide conversion at accessible overpotentials.

Lack of capable methods to measure and to actively control the crystallization process has been a limit on the advance of fundamental research as well as practical applications. The capability to measure the dynamic process in-situ and thus to actively control crystal formation is expected to establish much-needed high throughput and high efficiency crystallization technology. The broader impacts are demonstrated in that the proposed aims advance the paradigm of crystallization. Students from underrepresented groups and from disadvantageous backgrounds in metro Atlanta gain first-hand knowledge and experiences through the grant activities. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish an electroanalytical methodology combined with optical imaging that enables in-situ monitoring and active controls of single nucleus formation and single crystal growth. Analytical platforms are being developed with optimized nanostructures and surface functionalities to spatially confine the formation and growth of a single nucleus at the earliest stage (molecular assembly) one at a time. The kinetics of a single crystal nucleus formation and growth, governed by local transport of the target molecules around the nucleus, are controlled externally via a programmed potential waveform. Active control of mass transport is another superior advantage over the passive diffusion mechanism adopted in conventional crystallization methods. Because the transport and assembly processes are associated with changes in ionic current signals as well as optical properties, in-situ monitoring and adjustments are performed to tailor the nucleation and growth kinetics of individual events."

Lanthanide luminescence plays a vital role in our daily life due to the unique optical properties of these ions with respect to light generation and amplification. Extending from laser physics, other familiar applications in our regular life include lighting, displays, optical telecommunications, night vision, security inks, counterfeiting tags, luminescent coatings, medical imaging, medical diagnostics, and airport security checks.  New and more effective luminescent materials are desirable from both a technological and an economic necessity in order to make cheap, widely available, and long-lasting light emitting, or photonic, devices.

Using various techniques and in collaboration with scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the research team is figuring out how their reliable synthesis methods make these nanoparticles ultra-small and uniformly shaped and sized, at more than 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. The team also studies the relationship between the size, shape, structure, composition, and luminescence performance of these nanoparticles.

However, achieving the necessary accuracy for realistic and predictive simulations is a challenge. In this project, Dr. Paesani and his group are developing and applying a novel and powerful simulation methodology to model water oxidation in a class of highly porous solids known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Water oxidation is one of the key reactions in natural photosynthesis. Therefore, understanding the steps involved in water oxidation at the molecular level may aid in the development of artificial photosynthetic systems. MOFs are a relatively new class of materials and are ideal for these catalysts. The studies carried out by Dr. Paesani and his group are advancing both the theory and the computer modeling of MOFs and their chemistry, which are key to the rational development of new catalysts. In parallel with the research activities, an innovative education and outreach plan is being established to introduce freshman and sophomore undergraduate students to computational methods in chemistry and materials research.  Dr. Paesani and his group are also promoting interest in STEM disciplines among underprivileged and underrepresented minority students through the development of summer exchange programs at the University of California - San Diego.<br/><br/>The fundamental understanding of how to control water oxidation to molecular oxygen is a prerequisite for the development of artificial systems to harvest and convert solar energy as well as to enable visible-light-driven organic synthesis. It is well known that the availability of water as an electron donor opens up a wide variety of reductive processes that can be driven with electricity or sunlight. Since water is one of the ultimate products of fossil fuel combustion, the conversion of H2O molecules back into fuel involves thermodynamically uphill reactions that remove oxygen atoms. In this project, Dr. Paesani and his group are performing fundamental studies to investigate the elementary steps involved in water oxidation reactions in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are a relatively new class of porous materials with large surface areas that have already found application in gas storage (e.g., methane and hydrogen storage), carbon capture, hydrocarbon separation, chemical sensing, nonlinear optics, biomedical imaging, drug delivery, catalysis, electrical and proton conductivity, magnetism, and luminescence. Since MOF structure and physicochemical properties are highly tunable, MOFs represent promising platforms for building efficient functional devices for solar energy harvesting and conversion. Dr. Paesani and his group are developing and applying novel simulation methodologies that combine many-body representations of the molecular interactions with advanced techniques to describe chemical reactivity in the condensed phase to characterize the elementary steps associated with catalytic processes in MOFs. This information is key to the rational design of new MOF structures with properties specifically tailored for solar energy harvesting and conversion. The interdisciplinary nature of the research project represents an extraordinary opportunity for training at the interface of different disciplines, providing bridges and inter-connections between the fundamental laws of physics and the molecular properties of materials at the nanoscale. In this context, mentoring and outreach activities are specifically designed to promote science disciplines among high school and college students from underprivileged and underrepresented minorities through the development and implementation of summer exchange programs at UC San Diego.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Escher's art have fascinated the viewer and challenged their ability to trace the origin of connectivity. For some time now, mathematicians have described the topology of rings and cyclic overlapping structures with their programmable qualities into the so-called Knot Theory.  In polymer science, understanding how long polymer chains become tangled and how to get those tangled chains to dissolve in a solution can result in new materials with interesting physical properties and chemical properties that can extend the applications of plastics, coatings, rubber, and composites. There are many opportunities for training and mentoring future scientists in this interdisciplinary and practical field.  This research helps preparing a workforce that solves complex problems and produces valuable products.  <br/> <br/>This project focuses on the design and synthesis of new catenated polymer and block copolymer compositions via monomer ring opening (RO) and macroinitiator ring expansion polymerizations (REP) or REP-ROP Polymerizations. By utilizing the Knot Theory, it may be possible to obtain various knotted macromolecules, which have controlled entanglements as well as block copolymer composition with high yields and high molecular weight. The approaches towards the synthesis of catenated macromolecules involve: 1) phenanthroline-based macroinitiator templates; 2) homopolymers and block copolymers derived from atom transfer radical polymerization methods and ring closures with atom transfer radical coupling; 3) ring expansion strategies with polycaprolactones; and 4) polymer reactions that modify the side groups and control the composition and interaction parameters of the chains. Characterization methods include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MALDI mass sppectrometry, atomic force microscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and rheometry, which verify the polymer's chemical structure, topology, and phase separation in solution and solid state. Collaborations with polymer physicists, theorists, and rheologists are pursued to harness the properties of the catenated polymers as materials and compatibilizers for practical applications."

The discovery of the structure of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information, provided only a framework for describing how the genetic code is copied. However, focusing on DNA in isolation does not provide insights into how the entire machinery, needed to sustain the viability of the cell, is conveyed from the mother to the daughter cell. This is accomplished by networks of other protein molecules that transmit information through chemical reactions both in the process of replication, cell division, and adaptation. How do theses individual molecular components interact and function in a system that is capable of replicating, adapting to changing environment, and operating robustly in noisy crowded milieu?  What is the minimum level of complexity needed for a living cell to function? What sets the length scale of such a living system in terms of the molecular constituents? The goal is to develop a quantitative conceptual framework to answer these questions so that the ability to process signals, adapt, and replicate with high fidelity can be described using the laws of physics and chemistry  and using a bacterium as a case study. The interdisciplinary approach to this research involves integrating physics, chemistry, and information theory concepts, and is expected to provide a versatile training ground for students and postdoctoral fellows with diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the major objectives of the proposed research it is necessary to break new ground by creating new models and ideas coming from a variety of fields. An integrated approach will be developed by combining coarse-grained models of enzymatic reactions, ways of coupling feedback effects due to synthesis of small molecules and proteins, and accounting for non-equilibrium processes. These ideas will be used to explore the organization principles for adaptation to environmental fluctuations, cell size control, and competition between various factors that promote homeostasis.   These new concepts will be used to provide a new framework on how a simple bacterium is versatile enough to respond to harsh environmental fluctuations (high salinity or osmolarity) and adapt in a noisy environment.  Analyzing such behavior will require combining control theory and the underlying stochastic aspects of signal transmission achieved through chemical reaction networks.  In addition, the key question of how cell shape and size (on the order of a micron) emerge will be explored based on the notion that they use feedback to maintain proteostasis and keep the concentrations of metabolites in check. The questions raised here are fundamental and even if answered partially could have far-reaching implications in our understanding of how living systems function. An overarching long term goal of these studies is to begin to provide the framework to eventually design and control macroscopic cell behavior in terms of its underlying components."

Professor Zhao is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).  He is developing a new method for the selective synthesis of multiple stereoisomers of organic molecules.  Stereoisomers, which differ only subtly in their structures, may have totally different biological and/or pharmacological properties. The goal of this research project is to exploit the unique properties of modularly designed organocatalysts (MDOs) to achieve the easy synthesis of multiple diastereomers of complex organic molecules from the same starting materials, which is presently a very challenging task in chemistry. The research greatly facilitates the exploration of new chemical space and drug discovery. This project offers research opportunities for students, including students from underrepresented minorities, who are preparing for careers in the chemical sciences. UTSA is one of the most diverse institutions of higher education in the United States. Professor Zhao's group provides a high level of education and training for students through a variety of outreach programs that are already in place at UTSA.<br/><br/>Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of multiple diastereomers of various important polysubstituted carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds are under investigation.  The researchers use the same starting materials and different modularly designed organocatalysts to selectively generate different stereoisomers of the targets. Specifically, Professor Zhao is pursuing the development of novel MDO catalysts that are self-assembled from readily available precatalysts and the utilization of the MDOs in the catalytic tandem reactions for the diastereodivergent synthesis of polysubstituted carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds. The method is being investigated for the diastereodivergent syntheses of bioactive natural products of medicinal relevance. The research provides new catalysts that not only achieve the divergent synthesis of different stereoisomers of important molecules, but also improves the stereoselectivity in the synthesis.   Stereoselective synthesis is a current challenge in asymmetric catalysis. The research results are being incorporated into an organic laboratory aimed at undergraduates to help stimulate their interest and attract these students to the chemical sciences."

Together with their graduate and undergraduate students, they investigate the acidity of atmospheric aerosols (very fine droplets in the atmosphere). Several key processes that cause small particles to form and grow in the atmosphere are controlled by the acidity of the surface and interior of aerosol particles. The formation and growth of these small particles in the atmosphere have implications for their effects on health as well as their potential to directly and indirectly impact climate. Atmospheric aerosols are particles that are often smaller than 100 nanometers in diameter.

Further, the acidity appears to vary with particle size from ~10 nm (most acidic) to 50 nm (more neutralized). Knowledge of the acidity of sub-100 nm particles is important for understanding relatively simple acid-base chemistry, but also for accurately predicting acid-catalyzed processes on particle surfaces and in the bulk phase.  The specific objectives of this project are as follows: to use molecular modeling to predict pKa values for inorganic and organic acids and bases as a function of particle composition and size. This activity combines techniques such a computational quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics to model particles with diameters of up to 5 nm and to perform laboratory experiments to evaluate the predicted pKa values as a function of composition and size. This is done using a temperature- and humidity-controlled reaction chamber and chemical ionization mass spectrometers to determine precursor and nanoparticle composition.  The researchers will also develop and apply a parameterization applicable for multiscale modeling of relevant processes taking place in and on atmospheric aerosol particles.

Specifically, the project focuses on particles with two phases (organic and aqueous) and viscous/glassy particles recently observed in the atmosphere whose formation and properties are not well understood. Understanding how these particles change based on key atmospheric variables such as relative humidity and temperature will improve our ability to predict their formation, properties, and abundance in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the fundamental properties of mixed organic/inorganic particles through a series of laboratory studies in sealed environmental reaction cells coupled to two microscopes, a Raman microspectrometer and an atomic force microscopy with infrared (AFM-IR).

The researchers probe differences within individual particles to understand microscopic changes in physical and chemical properties. Of particular interest are phase separations as a function of particle size, and acidity and reactivity in the microenvironments of phase-separated particles. An outreach program, the Detroit Research Internship Summer Experience (D-RISE), is being expanded. It enables participants to develop interactive activities, such as on particulate matter in the atmosphere, that are presented to classmates the following academic year.

Professor Zajc and her students develop novel methods for synthesis of fluorinated organic compounds.  Organofluorine compounds are of importance in diverse fields, including agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, materials sciences, and as biological probes.  Approximately one in five pharmaceuticals contains a fluorine atom. Fluorine-18 (18F) labeled organofluorine compounds are often used in medicine (for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging).  As an example, 2-deoxy-2-(18F)-D-glucose is commonly used in brain imaging.  Organofluorine compounds are also rapidly gaining importance as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents - also used in the diagnosis of disease.  19F MRI is being studied for brain imaging, for instance, visualizing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease.  Development of novel methods for the efficient synthesis of organofluorine compounds, which is the focus of this funded project, is therefore of strong interest.  Students in Professor Zajc's research group are of diverse ethnicity and from an international community.  Research projects are designed for training students at all educational levels, in order to provide experience in an area of societal relevance.<br/><br/>The unique and valuable properties of organofluorine compounds make them important in a range of scientific areas.  However, selective introduction of fluorine atoms into organic molecules continues to be challenging.  This project develops novel chemical approaches to various classes of regiospecifically fluorinated compounds - those containing chiral centers.  Some of the molecules developed may have a direct impact on studying neurodegenerative disorders.  The approaches undertaken here focus on modular assemblies using new fluorinated building blocks.  Where applicable, the role of fluorine on reactivity is studied.  Due to the widespread importance of organofluorine compounds in medicinal and biological chemistry, including diagnostics such as the study of brain disorders using 19F MRI imaging, this research may have impact in areas beyond chemical synthesis.  The research activities involve education and training of students from diverse ethnic groups, including those that are underrepresented in the sciences.  The City College of New York has a large minority student population, and their education and training has an impact on a diversified workforce."

This portioning between the air and the surfaces of solids that are present in the air is poorly understood however, one phase may be preferred over the other due to incomplete mixing, physical barriers, and/or chemical reactions on the aerosol particles. Laboratory studies are conducted on single aerosol particles to isolate and investigate how and why compounds stick to their surfaces. These experimental studies provide fundamental parameters for improving computer models on aerosol formation and changes in these particles with time (ageing). This research is important as it may ultimately improve regional and global models of aerosols, which are relevant to air quality and human and animal health. Professor Keutsch also designs laboratory experiments to introduce a systems approach to undergraduate education.  This approach considers not only individual reactions but the coupled chemical and physical feedbacks that exist between different parts of the whole system (in this case, the gas and solid phases).

The structures of these isolated complexes will then be characterized in detail using a method based on a unique combination of mass spectrometry and vibrational predissociation spectroscopy.  Subsequent studies involving systematic variations of the catalyst structure will reveal the influence of ligand environment and metal center on the nature and electronic structure of the reaction complexes.  The active control of the solvent network in promoting processes such as proton coupled electron transfer will also be probed in detail.  The methodology developed here will allow for precise and systematic spectroscopic characterization of reactive species, providing a detailed description of the molecular level interactions involved in the water oxidation process and elucidating their relationship with the catalyst structure. Lastly, the results from these studies will also provide stringent benchmarks for theoretical methods used to understand the mechanisms of such molecular catalysts.   <br/><br/>The project will improve our understanding of the mechanism of catalytic water oxidation reactions, which will help the development of more efficient water oxidation catalysts.

Such visual and hands-on demonstrations of the concepts of mass spectrometry will have the potential to engage the interest of the general public and undergraduate students, providing them with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the sciences behind these widely used instruments.  Professor Garand will also provide initiation to research for undergraduate students through integrated research in classes and summer internships.  Such experiences can provide the students with a well-rounded educational experience as they decide their future paths."

This site impacts the professional chemistry careers and education of undergraduates and faculty from institutions with limited research infrastructure as well as those from underrepresented populations. This is achieved through establishment of meaningful, year-round, and long-term research collaborations driven by the need for academic productivity and excellence in undergraduate training. The model builds research teams of student-faculty pairs recruited from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) institutions. These collaborators are integrated with extramurally funded research groups from Duquesne. The model is proven to perpetuate itself, where invested collaborations ultimately mature to independent funding. The broader impacts of this work include meaningful research experiences to attract and retain the nation's diverse student talent pool. This will have the consequence of enhancing and diversifying the U.S. workforce by adding experts in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. <br/><br/>This project focuses on strong financial and infrastructure support of research collaborations that invigorate faculty from PUIs, HBCs, and LSAMP institutions. These faculty in turn directly impact students and learning environments at their home institutions. REU students have novel chemical research experiences in exciting and broad scientific themes, such as nanotechnology, homeland security, pharmaceutical drug design, forensic sciences, and chemical biology. Each student works directly with two faculty mentors in the laboratory (from the home institution and Duquesne). Students also consult with a theoretical faculty liaison, since each REU project is supplemented by well-defined computational components to expand the students' experience. REU students receive explicit training to reinforce the scientific method, scientific writing and speaking, ethics, safety, and workshops on state-of-the-art instrumentation to complement their experimental research and build invaluable skill sets. Each student has the opportunity to present their research locally, regionally, and nationally to expand their professional exposure and networking to make more informed career decisions and best prepare for graduate school."

Organic molecules released into the atmosphere through anthropogenic and biogenic activity undergo reactions that result in the formation of oxidized products.  The enhanced polar character of these oxidized products results in their ability to interact through hydrogen bonding. Although weak, hydrogen bonds are pervasive. Investigating the subtle impact of hydrogen bonding on the chemistry of oxygenated organics contributes to improving our understanding of atmospheric processes that control urban air quality as well as atmospheric radiative balance. In addition, the research permits the training and education of students at the graduate and undergraduate.  The project also provides opportunities for high school students and students from underrepresented groups to be exposed to university research.<br/><br/>In this work, vibrational overtone excitation combined with laser induced fluorescence detection, kinetic analysis, and computational chemistry is used to investigate the impact of hydrogen bonding on the chemistry of several oxygenated organic molecules.

In the second phase of the study the ability of carboxylic acids to promote hydrogen atom transfer reactions through intermolecular hydrogen bonding is investigated. Organic acids are ubiquitous in the atmosphere as they are byproducts of hydrocarbon oxidation. Their ability to catalyze hydrogen atom transfer reactions makes them an important contributor to various atmospheric processes including aerosol growth."

The proposed crosslinked polymeric layers are designed to possess high chemical and physical stability, with the goal of improving upon currently used separation materials. The proposed research is targeting a universal platform on which different separation media could be prepared, opening up possibilities for their use in specific practical applications. Broader impacts are addressed through the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, including members of traditionally underrepresented groups.

Experiments will be developed for the undergraduate laboratory so that more students can experience an authentic research experience in this setting. <br/><br/>The research project will exploit the chemistry of diazonium salts to assemble organic molecular entities on the surface of silica substrates, rendering materials with highly desirable properties for liquid chromatography (LC) and other separation techniques, dictated by the newly assembled layer on the material's surface. The strategy consists on attaching functionalized aryl groups on the silica surface, from which molecular layers will grow by means of diazonium chemistry, and then crosslinking the layers to create a highly stable polymer layer on the silica surface. During the different stages of optimizing the synthesis of the new layer on the silica surface, a systematic evaluation will be performed to assess the physical, chemical, and chromatographic properties of the material using a battery of techniques (e.g., Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gas adsorption analysis, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis).

These components work in concert to efficiently convert sunlight to chemical fuel for the cell.  The components are arranged so that when sunlight is absorbed by the pigments (color-containing compounds), the energy can move quickly from one component to the next before the energy is lost.  Nature accomplishes energy transfer with remarkable efficiency using light-harvesting organelles. Mimicking such a complex structure artificially could lead to formation of light-weight materials, whose photosynthetic function could be exquisitely controlled. However, making artificial photosynthetic systems remains a major challenge.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Ayzner at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and his students are building artificial light-harvesting organelles based on soft molecular materials, such as polymers. These polymers can self-assemble into larger structures that can rapidly transport excited states through space, thus mimicking the fundamental aspects of photosynthetic organelles. The project is providing training opportunities for graduate students.  Professor Ayzner is using the topic of energy harvesting as the vehicle to teach advanced chemical problem-solving skills to transfer students, thereby helping to prepare them for sustained success in the chemical sciences. <br/><br/>Accomplishing the formation of an artificial light-harvesting organelle first requires laying a foundation for assembling and interfacing an efficient electronic energy transfer (EET) relay with a larger structural scaffold. To this end, Professor Ayzner is synthesizing and assembling conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) into donor/acceptor complexes, whose structure and thermodynamics can be controlled via the coupling between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom. This project elucidates how the backbone of a CPE influences the EET efficiency within the complex by systematically tuning the mean polyelectrolyte length and chemical structure. The phase separation behavior and EET in co-existing phases of inter-CPE complexes is then characterized to elucidate the influence of excess ions on light-harvesting. Complexes are then interfaced with self-assembled vesicle-type compartments to form the foundation of a soft light-harvesting super-structure. Characterization of resulting assemblies involves combining time-resolved electronic spectroscopy, photon scattering, microscopy and rheological measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using modified clay mineral (organoclays) as an adsorbent represents a promising approach for removing harmful contaminants from environmental waters, but fundamental questions remain. This research team uses  spectroscopic techniques to study the details of the organoclay interlayer chemical environment to understand how the molecular-level properties of the clay influence its sorption efficiency.

Moreover, the potential toxicity of conventional surfactants used in organoclays has not been addressed. Using multiple spectroscopic techniques, sorption isotherms, and additional characterization tools, this project investigates factors that govern the organoclay interlayer chemical environment, including its size, crystallinity, and hydration, and how these properties influence the sorption efficiency of the organoclays.

The goal of this research is the development of catalytic chemical reactions using the earth-abundant and inexpensive copper (Cu) as the catalyst. The target reactions provide powerful tools for the syntheses of complex and diversified molecules, such as drugs and organic materials, by limiting the required number of reaction steps and thus minimizing the time for process development. The outcomes of this investigation have a positive impact on society by developing novel protocols for organic chemical transformations based on earth-abundant, sustainable catalysts. Professor Giri has established a partnership with the UNM College Enrichment and Outreach Program to involve undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented groups.  He has established an outreach program with the South Valley Academy, a public charter school in Benalillo County, New Mexico. <br/><br/>Integration of cross-coupling into the tandem and multi-component (MC) reaction manifolds has the potential to create new synthetic methodologies. The research focuses on developing Cu compounds as sustainable catalysts for the proposed transformations. As part of the education component, the investigator has developed a course for senior undergraduates and graduate students focused on organometallic chemistry that emphasizes the use of sustainable transition metals in the development of new chemical transformations. In this project, various organometallic reagents, amines, alcohols, and carbonyl compounds are employed as sources of nucleophiles to add across carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, alkynes, and allenes) and subsequently cross-couple with organohalides in a tandem fashion. The ability of copper to avoid beta-hydride eliminations is expected to facilitate the tandem and MC cross-couplings of electrophiles and nucleophiles that contain beta-hydrogens. Hybrid bidentate ligands containing both pi-acceptor and sigma-donor groups are employed to generate stable and active Cu in the +1 oxidation state required to conduct the proposed transformations. The ligands are tuned sterically and electronically to render Cu reactive towards the less reactive aryl halides. Alternatively, organic electron donor-based organic catalysts, which react with organohalides via a single electron transfer process, provide an alternative strategy for coupling reactions with less reactive aryl halides. A long-term goal of the project is to perform the reactions enantioselectively using chiral, non-racemic ligands to prepare complex molecules with multiple chiral centers.The research is performed at the interface of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, which provides an opportunity for training future scientists from high school to graduate school.

As technologies mature, continued progress on this front requires developing new materials with new and improved function. As a result of their emergent, size-dependent properties, nanomaterials are forecasted to significantly shape the future of next generation energy technologies. Nanomaterial function relies on the ability of scientists to access these materials with uniform and precise atomic structures. This is an enormous challenge since nanomaterials contain hundreds to thousands of atoms and even a few atoms out of place can significantly alter their function. Research conducted under this CAREER award aims to address the fundamental challenges in controlling the composition and interfaces of nanomaterials with atom-level precision. The globally-relevant nature of this research is leveraged to advance the major educational goals of this project, namely to: 1) create an undergraduate specialization in Chemistry for Energy at the University of Washington (UW), 2) develop hands-on demonstration materials and workshops on the topic of colloidal nanoscience targeted to middle and high school students in collaboration with the UW Phi Lambda Upsilon (National Chemistry Honor Society) chapter, and 3) broaden participation in chemistry at the undergraduate, graduate and professional level through work with the Chemistry Women Mentorship Network, the UW Women in Chemical Sciences, and the NSF-supported Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this award is to understand how indium phosphide (InP) and related colloidal quantum dots (QDs) nucleate and grow in solution and how to rationally modify that mechanism and the properties of the resulting nanocrystals using surface chemistry. As a step toward this goal, several themes are initiated to provide the experimental context in which nucleation, growth, and photoluminescence modulation in these materials can be studied. These include: 1) testing new models of InP nucleation using isolable, structurally characterized and atomically precise magic-sized cluster intermediates; 2) understanding how surface chemistry impacts the structure and function of InP magic-sized clusters to gain access to general strategies for anisotropic shape control and doping; and 3) discovering new post-synthetic surface chemistry to turn-on and color-tune the luminescence of InP and related QDs using Lewis acid coordination chemistry. The research approach focuses primarily on the development of new hypothesis-driven synthetic methods as well as spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of the properties and electronic structure of these materials. Ongoing collaborations with experts in time-dependent electronic structure theory, X-ray crystallography, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are leveraged to help answer fundamental structural and mechanistic questions.

Its presence in food can interfere with the adsorption of nutrients in the digestive track of many animals, including pigs and chickens. As a result, proteins and vital metal ions present in the animals' feed are rendered unavailable, causing an enormous loss in efficiency in the meat products made from these animals. With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul S. Cremer at the Pennsylvania State University is studying phytate and similar anions (molecules with extra negative charge) to understand their interactions with metal ions and to learn how these highly negatively charged species cause the precipitation of proteins and other large molecules from water solutions. This work not only helps shed light on how livestock feed can be used more efficiently, but also helps train graduate and undergraduate students in the chemical sciences. Simplified versions of these studies are being used as a springboard to update the curriculum and laboratories used to teach high school students about intermolecular forces and non-covalent interactions. <br/><br/>The Cremer group is exploring interactions between phytate and divalent metal cations in aqueous solutions. The interactions between various cations and individual phosphate groups are often similar, but this changes markedly when metal ions interact simultaneously with multiple phosphate groups, where the ions can bridge adjacent phosphate moieties. The thermodynamics of ion binding is being correlated with information on the polyanion's hydration shell that can be obtained by Raman and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. Such studies are also being extended to understand how ion binding and hydration water structures affect the salting out of proteins and polypeptides from aqueous solutions as a function of pH, salt concentration, and specific cation identity. In addition to phytate, which contains six phosphate groups around an inositol ring, studies are being performed with one through five phosphate groups placed around the ring with specific stereochemistry. Measurements are also being made with phosphatidylinositol lipids in planar membrane formats to elucidate the difference in binding behavior of polyphosphate groups bound to surfaces and those in bulk solution."

Lester of the University of Pennsylvania is investigating the chemical properties of reactive atmospheric intermediates that release hydroxyl radicals, which are fragments of the water molecule, with one hydrogen atom missing. Hydroxyl radicals are a key oxidant in the atmosphere and often called the atmosphere's detergent. Professor Lester and her group are exploring atmospheric chemical reactions that produce hydroxyl radicals. Their work is leading to a better understanding of the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, where we live and breathe, and thus has potential benefits to society.<br/> <br/>The reactive intermediates that give rise to hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere are produced by reactions of ozone with isoprene, a small molecule that is produced in large quantities by plants, and other alkenes (often called ""volatile organic compounds""). When formed, these intermediates have enough internal energy that they spontaneously fall apart into an organic fragment and a hydroxyl radical, in a process known as ""unimolecular decay,"" or react with other molecules.  The problem is a difficult one because the intermediates are large and complex, and understanding their chemistry requires the use of state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods. Professor Lester and her group produce these reactive intermediates in the laboratory, and study their unimolecular decay and light-induced dissociation processes using action spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The students working with Professor Lester gain experience in sophisticated experimental and theoretical methods that probe the physical properties of molecules and chemical reactions, and thus a significant broader impact of the project is its contribution to the training of future scientists."

The goal of this project is to improve public access to clean water. The majority of drinking water in the U.S. comes from groundwater aquifers. In the U.S., over 126,000 groundwater aquifers contain toxic chemicals. This research aims to understand how toxic chemicals transform in groundwater systems over time. The work looks at how the composition of water affects the transformations. The work also develops a new teaching program for grade 6-12 young women. The teaching program aims to teach young women about groundwater and chemistry.  <br/><br/>This work aims to mechanistically elucidate why pollutant reduction rates by Fe(II) bound to iron oxide minerals are highly sensitive to changes in solution chemistry and the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles. Many classes of environmental pollutants undergo reductive transformations in groundwater coupled to the oxidation of oxide-bound Fe(II). These transformations significantly alter a pollutant's toxicity, solubility, and/or bioavailability, and therefore they must be taken into account in risk assessments and remediation efforts. The rates of these reactions are highly variable among studies. Reported reaction rate constants varying by over six orders of magnitude for commonly studied pollutants. Models based on thermodynamic parameters can often explain trends among measured pollutant reduction rates in simple water chemistries. However, they fail to describe datasets collected with more complex water chemistries relevant to real groundwater systems, limiting their practical use. To address this issue, this project tests several working hypotheses previously proposed in the literature to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for changes in pollutant reduction rates when iron oxide nanoparticles, carbonate, and/or natural organic matter are present.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to resolve one of the central challenges of theoretical chemistry: accurate prediction of the electronic properties of nanoscale systems and their response to external perturbations. This can lead to an understanding of such devices at the molecular level with predictive theory. The results are central in developing memory and logic molecular devices, molecule-based sensors, photovoltaics for solar conversion and new types of electronics.  The ability of the research to interconnect different scientific communities allows students involved in the project to participate in a flexible curriculum, thus preparing them to work in either fundamental or applied sciences, in academy or in national labs, in one of the fields or at interfaces of many-body theory, molecular spectroscopy, and computational quantum chemistry.<br/><br/>Theoretical simulations of nanoscale open non-equilibrium systems mostly employ single-particle basis functions (e.g. orbitals as in the non-equilibrium Green function density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) approach). These approaches allow treatment of systems of realistic sizes, but become inconvenient in treating strong intra-system interactions. An alternative approach, the non-equilibrium atomic limit (e.g. the pseudoparticle (PP) or Hubbard NEGF), utilizes many-body states of the isolated system as a basis, which allows accounting for the system interactions. The applicability of such formulations is limited to relatively small systems. The project develops a methodology, the non-equilibrium divide-and-conquer method, which capitalizes on the strong sides of both methodologies: the NEGF-DFT ability to treat big systems and the PP and Hubbard NEGF ability to account for strong local interactions exactly. Partitioning of the original system (either in real or state space) is utilized with the parts treated by either single-particle or many-body states approaches. This extends the usual divide-and-conquer methodology to the realm of open non-equilibrium quantum systems.

To this end, a major hurdle in understanding GSLs is obtaining pure and well-defined samples. In the current project, Dr. Guo is developing new strategies to make GSLs, as well as making GSL derivatives for use as tools to study their biochemical properties. This project explores the fundamental reactivity of GSLs in biology, especially diseases related to the human brain. Other activities supported by this award include undergraduate student engagement in scientific research.  New curriculum development targeted at improving chemical education, and interest in carbohydrate chemistry and glycobiology is also a focus of Dr. Guo's outreach and educational activities.  This project advances human health while supporting education at the interface of chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>Dr. Guo's strategy for the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) consists of enzymatic carbohydrate assembly of a substrate bearing a truncated lipid followed by chemoselective lipid elongation via olefin cross-metathesis and other reactions.

To reach this goal, Dr. Murkin developed a method for measuring kinetic isotope effects based on two-dimentional NMR spectroscopy that delivers better sensitivity and precision than previous methods. Transition state models will be constructed by matching the theoretical kinetic isotope effects obtained computationally to those measured experimentally.<br/><br/>When a molecule undergoes a reaction and reaches the transition state, the atoms that react or experience geometric or electrostatic changes exert differences in rates when substituted with heavier isotopes.

Asymmetric catalysis is the development of small molecules that can achieve high selectivity in chemical reactions - producing a specific product in high prurity. Chiral molecules have a right-handed and left-handed version.  These two mirror image molecules are described as enantiomers. A major goal of this resesarch is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Brnsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are used to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes and address challenging problems. Multifunctional catalysts are being used as a means to achieve enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.

Kupper's study of how important trace elements (iron, boron and iodine) are taken up and stored in seaweeds, and how these elements interact with each other so as to affect the plant biology. Seaweeds represent an important resource with a wide range of uses in the food, cosmetic, and fertilizer industries. They are also attracting increasing attention as a source for biofuels that do not compete with terrestrial plants for food production. The project utilizes advanced high resolution synchrotron radiation methods to define the precise locations and chemical states of iron, iodine and boron in two important seaweeds and uses this information to assist in determining the biological importance of interactions between them. This work also provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of important techniques.  In addition, since San Diego State University has a high minority population (10th largest grantor of minority bachelor's degrees in the USA), this research project is thus expected to favorably impact minority training in the sciences. Outreach activities are also in progress.<br/><br/>While in the cytoplasm many metalloproteins are present as a complicated mixture not easily amenable to simple analysis without prior potentially destructive, and certainly disruptive, isolation and purification.  Many other metalloproteins are stored, sequestered or localized in discrete locations within the cell/organelles and are also difficult to isolate and study. As the resolution and flux density of synchrotron radiation (SR) increases, it may be possible to pinpoint such systems and analyze and characterize them directly in situ without need for isolation or purification. Thus, one goal of this research is to see what the limits are for SR methods for visualizing the chemical state, localization and potential interactions of trace elements as applied to biological samples given the increasing capabilities of 3rd generation synchrotrons where significant progress (both in terms of brilliance and resolution) has been evident. The project is using utilizing advanced high resolution (micron to submicron) SR methods, i.e. microprobe, 3D tomography, IR/Raman, XANES and EXAFS to define the precise locations and chemical states of iron, iodine and boron in two model marine macroalgae (Ectocarpus siliculosis, Macrocystis pyrifera).

Lignin is an Earth abundant organic biopolymer that provides the starting point to recycle carbon from plants into the environment.  In this project, the researchers explore pathways for the molecular rearrangement of lignin to form the molecules present in soil, water and sediments.

This research subjects both synthesized and natural lignin to oxidative decomposition by ROS in the presence of aqueous iron species, mimicking environmental oxidation. The study employs Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, multidimensional liquids and solids NMR, and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to discern molecular transformation pathways.

This collaborative project combines the mutual development of advanced force fields and energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The field of biomolecular modeling and simulation currently relies on a simple representation of the potential energy surface of molecules based on what is known as the ""pairwise additive"" force field. But to design new drugs or new biomaterials the field needs new and higher accuracy molecular mechanics (MM) force fields.  These new force fields introduce new terms that describe processes not considered in simple pair-wise force fields, for example, polarization and charge transfer. The introduction of such terms pose great challenges for rational force field design as well algorithmic and software challenges.  The force field development is enabled in part by using information from an energy decomposition method (EDA) that is based on state-of-the art quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. This collaborative proposal is a partnership that couple's advances in EDA methods with the design and validation of next generation force fields, in a way that permits each to advance the impact of the other. These methods are used to help synthetic chemists make new drugs, to aid in the design of new functional materials, and to create new catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by many orders of magnitude.  All the methods developments resulting from this proposal are being implemented in many widely used computational chemistry software packages.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>The proposed research is built on three main thrusts. First, to impact the efficiency of polarizable force fields, a new procedure to avoid self-consistent iterations is being developed for use in MM dynamics, and within the inner loop of QM/MM calculations. Second, the two research groups are engaged in a major effort to test and improve MM parameters in polarizable force fields for condensed phase modeling, to assess non-bonded parameters for Pauli-exclusion, permanent electrostatics, polarization, and to explore models for additional short-range contributions from charge penetration, charge transfer, and exchange repulsion. In addition, attention is paid to torsional and solute-solvent interactions in biomolecules, where there is significant scope for improvement. These efforts, informed by EDA tools, are complemented by validation studies including scalar couplings in polypeptides, Stark effects and melting curves in three proteins. Specific outcomes   include an upgraded polarizable potential of the AMOEBA family, as a well as more advanced model that includes additional non-classical terms. The third thrust is the development of EDA methods. New capabilities that inform the MM developments include force decomposition analysis, partitioning of polarization into direct and indirect terms and the many-body decomposition of the latter. A soundly based EDA for coupled cluster (CC) theory is being developed.    Finally, new advances in variational EDA for chemical bonds are pioneered including multiple bonds and dynamical correlation.   When developed the advanced MM potential energy surfaces methodology and models will be provided to OpenMM, OMNIA, TINKER, and LibEFP, and the new proposed EDA capabilities to Q-Chem and ONETEP.    The Head-Gordon groups develop training materials based on this research for use in computational chemistry community workshops and schools.  Plans are to distribute these materials through interaction with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) as well as through Q-Chem's instructional support web pages"

This includes the chemical reactions that control the levels of air and water pollutants. The reaction mechanisms can be extremely complex, involving a large of number of chemical intermediates and products. Highly reactive radical intermediates, organic peroxy radicals (RO2) and alkoxy radicals (RO), are formed. These radicals can react via a number of channels, and form a wide range of products. This project aims to improve our understanding of the rates and the products of these reactions. The focus is on how the reaction conditions may control such reactivity. This understanding can ultimately lead to improved models of a wide range of important environmental processes. This enables better predictions and ultimately more informed policy decisions. <br/>This project involves both experimental (laboratory) and computational (modeling) studies of RO and RO2 radical reactivity under a wide range of environmental conditions.  In the experiments, the radicals are generated by photolysis of appropriate precursor molecules. This is done in the gas phase (using a flow reactor), the bulk liquid phase (using a liquid batch reactor), and within submicron aerosol particles (in an aerosol flow tube). Products are detected primarily by two instruments, an aerosol mass spectrometer for the condensed-phase products and a chemical ionization mass spectrometer for the gaseous products. The laboratory studies are carried out in parallel with the modeling work. This links rates and product distributions with detailed chemical mechanisms. Computational tools include quantum-chemical calculations of structures and energies, calculations of reaction rates, and chemical kinetic modeling of complex reaction mechanisms using the Reaction Mechanism Generator."

Professor Ken Shimizu from University of South Carolina Columbia and colleagues Qian Wang, Michael Walla, Thomas Makris and Norma Frizzell have acquired a high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HR-Q-ToF-MS) equipped with a series of attachments. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In a quadrupole mass analyzer, there are four cylindrical rods parallel to each other which are responsible for filtering sample ions, based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Ions are separated based on the stability of their trajectories in the oscillating electric fields applied to the rods. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It provides training opportunities to faculty and students from neighboring Historically Black College Universities (HBCUs) such as Benedict College, South Carolina State University, and Claflin University. The instrument supports partnerships with many local companies and government agencies.<br/><br/>The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for the characterization of compounds obtained by selectively functionalizing carbon-hydrogen bonds of natural products, and for exploring protein assembly, bioconjugation chemistry, and biomaterials sciences. The instrument is essential for studying protein succination and non-enzymatic chemical modification of protein thiol residues, and for studying the impacts of wastewater reuse, hydraulic fracturing, and coal-fired power plant discharges on drinking water. The mass spectrometer is used for the identification of mechanisms needed to maintain adequate intracellular levels of the essential metal iron and mitochondrial control of thiol-disulfide redox balance. The instrument is also used to determine plants response to environmental stress, for understanding connections amongst neurons, and deciphering the molecular pathways regulating cytoplasmic dynein, a cytoskeletal motor protein that move along microtubules in cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these biosensors still suffer from drawbacks such as limited photostability, brightness, penetration depth, and color contrast, which hinder their further applications in physical and life sciences.

Decades of research showed that protein glycosylation plays key roles in cell biology, including cell-cell connections and signaling between cells.  However, the traditional biological approaches that were used to make these discoveries have critical limitations that prevent their application towards gaining a detailed understanding of these important associations.  To overcome these roadblocks, the Pratt lab seeks to develope and test chemical tools that will enable the selective visualization, identification, and characterization of protein glycosylation. These tools will be applied to the investigation of the biochemistry of glycosylation and are to made available to other laboratories, as well. Additionally, we are also applying one of these chemical tools to investigate the role of a specific type of glycosylation, termed O-GlcNAcylation, in the death of cells. There is an important element of undergraduate research in the chemical and biological sciences in this project, and outreach to those in inner city schools with an eye toward increasing the participation or members of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM studies.<br/><br/>Metabolic chemical reporters of protein glycosylation are analogues of monosaccharides that bear bioorthogonal reactive groups, such as azides or alkynes. If these analogues are similar enough to their natural counterparts, so as to not interfere with the chemistry of native glycosidation enzymes, they will be metabolized by cells and incorporated into glycans. The azides or alkynes can then undergo selective reactions, such as the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, to install visualization or identification tags. Unfortunately, this research group and others have shown that the majority of previously developed reporters are not selective for one type of glycosylation, limiting their use in biological discovery. Recently, the first reporter that is specific for one type of glycosylation, namely O-GlcNAc modifications, was developed in these laboratories. This project is designed to build upon this exciting result in two ways. First, the Pratt lab will create and characterize other reporters with the goal of identifying chemical tools that are selective for other types of glycosylation. Second, they will use their selective O-GlcNAc reporter to investigate the role of O-GlcNAcylation on cell-death proteins, which are key to the fundamental biology of all metazoans."

George Zheng at The University of Georgia to investigate the molecular basis for the enzymatic mechanisms of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). <br/>Biological traits such as eye and hair color are encoded in the specific genes.  Factors other than gene sequences also play roles in when genes are turned on and off.  The variations in traits that do not depend on gene sequences are referred to collectively as epigenetics.  One key epigenetic mechanism is the acetylation of chromosomal proteins called histones catalyzed by enzymes known as histone acetyltransferases (HATs).  How HAT enzymes regulate epigenetic processes is poorly understood. This research project is designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms in the function of HAT proteins.  The program will create interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in chemical biology and epigenetics research.  By getting involved in these projects, students will learn how to design experimental strategies and apply advanced technologies to resolve key problems in today's cutting-edge biological research.  Outreach will be extended to high school students by sponsoring research internships for them. These research-related educational efforts are important to prepare next-generation scientists in chemical and biological sciences.<br/><br/>Functional roles will be investigated for key amino acid residues of the HATs in substrate recognition and acetylation.  Bioorthogonal chemical biology probes will be used to profile cellular substrates of the MYST HATs at the proteomic level, and activity-based chemical probes will be created to dissect critical cellular factors that regulate the enzymatic activity of the MYST HATs.  A multidisciplinary approach, involving molecular cloning, organic synthesis, protein expression, enzymology, and mass spectrometry, will be employed to investigate substrate specificity and biochemical functions of key MYST HAT enzymes.  The proposed research can be expected to yield a better understanding of HAT biology by providing mechanistic insights into how protein acetylation is regulated and exerts its impact in MYST-mediated cellular pathways.  In the process, new chemical tools for the functional study of HATs in general will be prepared.  On a broader level, advancement of knowledge of post-translational modifications in epigenetic regulation will be coupled with multidisciplinary research training opportunities for graduate students and undergraduates as well as internship experiences for high schools students."

This method holds the key to explaining the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules. By understanding the details of this motion, Piecuch and his group can precisely determine the amounts of energy needed to break chemical bonds and transform reactants into products.  The ability to do these calculations accurately will ultimately aid in the design of new materials, better catalysts, and more efficient energy sources. The new approach uses repeated random tests of many small energy contributions and retains those found to be most important. This approach reduces the computational costs of high-accuracy methods by orders of magnitude. Once fully developed, the methods will be shared with the community via open-source mechanisms. Findings resulting from the activities are being used in teaching courses and communicated through publications, seminars, and conference presentations. These ideas provide positive training experiences in the forefront of the physical sciences for members of the Piecuch group. <br/><br/>This research addresses one of the key challenges in electronic structure theory, namely the development of practical and systematically improvable ab initio computational schemes aimed at an accurate description of molecular energetics. It is widely accepted that size extensive methods based on the coupled-cluster theory are excellent candidates for addressing this challenge. However, it has been notoriously difficult to incorporate higher-than two-body components of the cluster operator, needed to achieve a quantitative description, without running into prohibitive computational costs of higher-order coupled-cluster schemes. The proposed methodology solves the problem, allowing one to obtain accurate energetics equivalent to high-level coupled-cluster calculations, even when electronic quasi-degeneracies and higher-than pair excitations become significant, at a small fraction of the computational cost. It also preserves the black-box character of conventional single-reference computations, by fusing the deterministic formalism, abbreviated as CC(P;Q) with the stochastic configuration interaction and coupled-cluster Monte Carlo approaches. The formal and algorithmic advances and efficient computer implementations will be accompanied by calculations of molecular potential energy surfaces relevant to spectroscopy, chemical reaction mechanisms and dynamics, and catalysis. The work provides important training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and the programs being developed will be widely shared with the broader theoretical community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roberts of the University of Texas at Austin and his graduate students study very small inorganic particles called semiconductor nanocrystals.  Nanocrystals are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes. The optical properties of these nanocrystals can be tuned by altering their size and shape, which makes them useful for applications such as displays, photovoltaic cells, and photodetectors. However, processing these materials into conductive thin films needed for electronics remains difficult. The researchers approach this challenge by combining the nanocrystals with surface-bound molecules designed to improve the electrical conductivity of nanocrystal thin films. The resulting structures are studied using spectroscopic techniques and photoconductivity measurements. This project also includes an outreach effort entitled GReen Energy At Texas (GREAT) designed to attract Community College students to the physical sciences by introducing them to green energy research. <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to understand the key factors that facilitate electronic coupling between semiconductor nanocrystals and their surface ligands and to use interactions of this type to improve charge transport in nanocrystal optoelectronic films. The nature of the ligand can impact the bandgap and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. This suggests some degree of electronic coupling between the nanocrystals and the ligands that involves charge transfer. This project quantitatively assesses the degree to which ligands facilitate charge transfer between nanocrystals in thin film. To accomplish this goal, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy is used to map charge density changes within nanocrystal ligand shells following photoexcitation. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and photo-CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) measurements determine how exciton-delocalizing ligands (EDLs) modify charge carrier transport in nanocrystal thin films."

Gamma-lactones are medicinally relevant compounds, acting as key constituents of many biologically active molecules (e.g., antibiotics and HIV-1 inhibitors) and also with the potential to function as conduits for the synthesis of other biologically interesting molecules. The development of methods to prepare structural motifs commonly found in natural products and biological active synthetics has great importance for both the academic and the industrial sectors, both in pharma and in biotechnology.  The broader impacts of this project also involve technical training of students, from the undergraduate to post-doctoral levels, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Three different strategies are being pursued for the development of enantioselective variants of gamma-lactone forming reactions from sulfoxonium salts.  Current methods for the synthesis of gamma-lactones are often characterized by multistep approaches, limited substrate scope, and modest diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity. The Kerrigan research group has developed a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of gamma-lactones bearing an alpha-quaternary stereogenic center, through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes and ketenes (the ?3-component reaction?). It features an interesting [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement as the key step. Under this project, the Kerrigan research team plans to explore the scope of the reaction e.g., including an examination of stabilized ylides, semi-stabilized ylides, and monosubstituted ketenes.   Professor Kerrigan's group is investigating enantioenriched aminosulfoxonium salts, chiral Koga amines, and chiral Bronsted acids (chiral hydrogen bond donor catalysts) for asymmetric induction in the gamma-lactone-forming reactions.  Successful development of the project has the potential to provide as it proposes efficient and inexpensive access to a number of desirable 5-membered cyclic synthons."

Together with their students, the faculty members seek to develop an environmentally-friendly approach to purifying water. Water contamination by highly toxic arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) is a serious threat to the environment.  This has affected the health of hundreds of millions of humans globally. The approach is to coat magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with natural organic matter (NOM). The coated nanoparticles can strongly bind arsenic and selenium and can convert them to less toxic forms upon solar irradiation. The magnetic nanoparticles carrying the arsenic and selenium are later removed from the contaminated water with a magnet. Overall, the research activities are expected to strengthen co-operation among the local community, educational institutes, and investigators. The<br/>broader societal impacts of this research include enhancing sustainable development. The knowledge obtained from these studies guides the development of new water treatment methodologies using environmentally-friendly materials. Application of these insights may accelerate the implementation of related technologies in addressing environmental problems, as well as advance the understanding of the interaction of natural organic matter and metals to determine their fate, transport and bioavailability.  The research plan emphasizes participation of persons from underrepresented groups. It also includes a high school outreach program with local schools to educate the students on water quality and water contamination issues.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions of As and Se species with fractionated NOM and the subsequent NOM-photosensitized redox transformations of As and Se.  Specific trapping or quenching agents are used to study the roles of individual reactive oxygen species, electron transfer and energy transfer processes in the NOM photosensitized transformations. These fundamental studies guide the selection of the most promising NOM fractions for grafting onto the surface of different sized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the process of interest. The research is expected to aid in the development of strategies for optimizing removal and conversion of toxic metals.  Such a process is is critical to water reuse and treatment."

The successful implementation of this design principle could potentially lead to new ferroelectrics and conductors that could be actuated by the action of light. Leveraging the expertise of the Shatruk and Dalal groups in the synthesis and characterization of magnetic and photomagnetic materials, ferroelectric materials, and organic conductors, the team aims to create novel multifunctional materials that can be employed in  electronic devices or light-activated switches.

The Shatruk/Dalal team will explore approaches to couple the photoinduced magnetic bistability at the molecular level to long-range metal-insulator transitions and ferroic orderings (magnetic or electric) in molecule-based materials. In particular, the team will study Fe(II) complexes with spin crossover (SCO) behavior, which stems from the temperature or light-induced transition between diamagnetic low-spin (LS) and paramagnetic high-spin (HS) states of the Fe(II) ion. The photoinduced LS to HS transitions will be invoked in order to achieve properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity via photoexcitation. Materials in which SCO coexists with conductivity will provide a platform to test the effects of concerted atomic displacements associated with SCO on the conductivity of the organic substructure, with the potential to achieve photoinduced superconductivity via chemical compression.  Another thrust aims to explore photoinduced magnetic switching, akin to SCO, in metal-free organic systems, where the change in the magnetic state is due to interconversions between paramagnetic radicals and diamagnetic dimers of radicals. The study of such metal-free systems could open up a new area in the molecular magnetism field that would parallel the studies currently performed on transition metal complexes."

For example, the colors of light emitted by these nanoparticles can be altered simply by changing the size. This type of size-tunability is exploited in many modern electronic devices, such as high-resolution displays and biomedical sensors. Other properties can also change with particle size.  For example, the melting point of nanoparticles tend to decrease as their size is reduced, which presents problems for applications that involve significant heating during manufacturing. In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Schaller at Northwestern University is studying the melting of nanoparticles after the sudden introduction of energy.  Working with his students, Professor Schaller uses very short pulses of laser light to rapidly heat nanoparticles, causing them to expand and melt. The team then employs a series of ultrafast experimental methods to monitor structural changes in the nanoparticle lattice. The insights gained from the research could impact technologies ranging from light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) to solar cells. These insights may help to advance additive manufacturing in 3D printing, which could benefit from facile melting and growth of particles into larger solids. The project also provides education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.

Rates of contaminant degradation are quantified and solid materials characterized using advanced materials characterization methods before, during, and after reactions. Experiments are performed with and without the addition of model NOM molecules (e.g., catecholates and carboxylates), NOM isolates obtained from the International Humics Substances Society (IHSS), and NOM samples collected from the environment. A particularly novel aspect of the proposed work is direct imaging of the particles in reaction media by way of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to evaluate aggregation state and quantify in situ accessible surface area. The solid-state (i.e., mineralogical) changes and changes in the aggregation state of suspended mineral particles are quantitatively linked to the observed contaminant degradation kinetics, which enables the development of an integrated model of iron oxide reactivity.

Specific targets include measurements of the rates and the extent of isotope exchange between aqueous uranium (VI) and solid uranium (IV) oxides and between aqueous lead (II) and solid lead (IV) oxides. The impacts of recrystallization on the composition, structure and size of the resulting particles is being characterized. Isotope exchange and recrystallization under conditions relevant to remediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater and the control of lead in drinking water distribution systems are being used to quantify the impacts of recrystallization on contaminant mobility."

Phosphorus (P) is an essential component of fertilizers, but in excess, a pollutant. Inorganic phosphorus is the form required by plants. Animals can use either organic or inorganic phosphorus. Both organic and inorganic phosphorus can be dissolved or suspended in water.  The transformation of organic P to inorganic P is poorly understood. The key research objective is to better understand the chemical controls of this transformation. Outreach activities are carried out on the topic of the fate of organic P including fertilizers, organic wastes, and organic matter in soils. The outreach is aimed at increasing public literacy, from inner-city middle school students to farmers. Both investigators are involved in educational activities for farmers in New York and Delaware, respectively. Different stakeholders gain valuable knowledge regarding nutrient and fertilizer management on agricultural lands.<br/><br/>This project applies a multidisciplinary approach. The research activities combine tools from molecular biology, analytical chemistry, and computational modeling. Molecular-level insights are obtained on the chemical factors that control the enzymatic release of inorganic P from complex organic assemblages. The project has three main objectives. First, it studies the activities of phosphatase enzymes with organic assemblages. Second, it addresses the effects of mineral surfaces on enzyme-substrate recognition. Third, the catalytic dynamics in response to external chemical stimuli is modeled. Metabolomics profiling enables the monitoring of catalytic hydrolysis of different organic P assemblages. Isotopes are used to track enzyme catalysis. This provides information on the role of different enzymes in recycling organic P in response to the chemistry of the environmental matrix. Molecular dynamics simulations in concert with the experimental studies illustrate the supramolecular framework responsible for the environmental biotransformation of organic P. The research findings shed light on how biogeochemical factors control phosphatase-mediated inorganic P generation from organic P assemblages.

Because of difficulties in isolation and purification, obtaining serviceable quantities of oligosaccharides for biological studies requires chemical synthesis.  The synthesis of oligosaccharides suffers from a number of technological shortcomings including poor stability of chemical intermediates and technically challenging procedures; these limitations are being addressed by the current project.  Scientific advances from this work result in improved syntheses of oligosaccharides, which in turn facilitate discoveries in biology and enable the development of oligosaccharide vaccines and therapeutics.

O-Glycosylation methods using ABTGs derived from sugars that are commonly found in mammalian oligosaccharides are under investigation.  In addition, 1,2-cis-selective glycosylations with ABTGs that exploit their unusual mechanism of activation are being developed.  Finally, a synthesis of the human milk oligosaccharide lacto-N-neotetraose using ABTGs as key intermediates is underway.  This research program provides a series of O-glycosylation electrophiles in ABTGs that can be utilized by scientists with little training in chemical synthesis.  The well-established utility of Boc- and Fmoc-protected amino acids has placed polypeptide synthesis within the reach of non-experts. Similarly, the ABTGs saccharides, when fully developed, place the synthesis of oligosaccharides in the hands of scientists who require these compounds for the study of glycobiology.  The educational plan involves outreach to underprivileged high school students, many of whom are women and underrepresented minorities.  Outreach activities include summer chemistry lab activities geared toward the development of laboratory skills that assist these students in college-level laboratory courses.

Groundwater is a critical national resource, used daily to meet individual, agricultural, industrial, and commercial needs. Soluble, toxic organic chemicals (such as chlorinated solvents and wood preservatives) in groundwater restrict its availability for use.  Many treatment strategies are based on moving the contaminant into an alternate phase (e.g., gas or solid). This project tests the hypothesis that ""polymerization in place"" strategies can be used to increase the molecular weight of some contaminants in the subsoil, allowing them to form solids that separate from the liquid groundwater. The process of immobilizing the contaminants ensures that they are no longer available to plants and animals (including people) that use the water. This study may produce a more efficient approach for contaminant removal. The research is carried out by graduate students who receive training in fundamental chemical research with applications in sustainable approaches to solving environmental challenges.<br/><br/>The team explores this strategy by examining the kinetics and products of the reactions of several commonly-found groundwater contaminants. These include chlorinated solvents and wood preservative. The model contaminants used in this study include the most widely detected organic contaminants reported in the National Assessment of Water Quality groundwater database.  Several widely-used polymerization catalysts are being tested. New technologies may reclaim significant groundwater resources that currently are prohibitively expensive to recover.

Reaction intermediates are difficult to study because they are only present for a short period of time before they react to form more stable molecules. Professor Douberly and his students overcome this long-standing experimental challenge by sequentially adding the individual reactants to liquid helium droplets. In the ultra-cold environment of the helium droplet, which is about 452 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, the reaction intermediates are ""frozen out"", allowing time for their molecular structures to be observed using laser spectroscopy. This project targets two fundamental chemical reactions that play key roles in the atmosphere, and is thus impacting our understanding of the complex web of chemical reactions associated with air pollution and the formation of small liquid droplets called aerosols.<br/><br/>The first chemical reaction targeted by the project is the oxidation of isoprene, a small molecule that accounts for half of the organic compounds emitted into the atmosphere by plants, and is thus important to our understanding of the troposphere, the lowest portion of the Earth's atmosphere. Isoprene is oxidized by hydroxyl radicals, which are added to the helium droplets, and infrared spectroscopy is used to probe the branching of the reaction into the various intermediates. The intermediates are then reacted with oxygen to produce the associated hydroxyperoxy radicals, which are also studied using infrared techniques. The second aim of the project centers on identifying the minimum number of water molecules that are needed to observed the spontaneous transfer of a proton from sulfuric acid to water, a process that is central to the nucleation of atmospheric aerosol particles.  This process is studied through the sequential addition of water molecules to helium droplets containing a single sulfuric acid molecule. Species selective spectroscopy is then used to determine the structures of these small acid-water clusters and identify the onset of proton loss from the acid.  Analogous measurements probe the effect of ammonia (and other amines) on reducing the critical cluster size necessary for spontaneous proton transfer. In addition to providing important insight into fundamental atmospheric processes, the project provides opportunities for student training, mentoring, and the integration of laboratory research with undergraduate-centered educational activities."

Professor Jonathan Karty from Indiana University and colleagues Simon Brassell, Silas Cook, James McKinlay and Jason Tennessen are acquiring a high resolution gas-chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer with tandem capabilities (HRes GC-MS-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components go into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a gas chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating gaseous mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The tandem capabilities allow for additional separation in a second stage. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from chemical, biological, geological and medicinal sciences as well as high school students through a variety of programs such as the Indiana University Summer Scholars Institute for students at minority serving institutions as well as the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.<br/><br/>This mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It enables research that elucidates of the role of climate on human evolution by measuring paleoclimate markers from Olduvai Gorge and explores the metabolic basis for cell proliferation and growth in Drosophila. The instrumentation aids in carrying out 13-carbon experiments to quantify metabolic pathway utilization in microbes as well as in distinguishing intermediates generated during organic syntheses of natural products. The mass spectrometer is also used in profiling and characterizing pheromones and sustainable carbon-carbon bond forming catalysts."

The mechanical degradation of polymers limits their use in lightweight structural materials, consumer products, and biomedical applications.  Prof. Stephen Craig at Duke University is learning how to dictate the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions that are accelerated by an applied mechanical force. These reactions impact multiple aspects of materials design, including the macroscopic failure and mechanical limitations of current polymeric materials. In addition, mechanically responsive functional groups might serve as the critical elements in new stress-responsive and self-healing polymeric materials. Prof. Craig's studies aim to provide insight into how the macroscopic mechanical forces experienced by polymers during use can be effectively channeled into desired chemical responses, providing a foundation for new classes of polymers.  Broader impacts of the project include: (1) integration of research and education through a new, regional technical training program that supports and enriches the research activities and scientific training experiences provided by primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, advanced high schools, and smaller research universities; (2) active learning modules and associated laboratory experiences in introductory chemistry and through coupled undergraduate and high school research experiences; (3) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by engaging and recruiting young scientists early in their scientific careers, before the onset of disproportionate attrition from the sciences; (4) disseminating the results of the research broadly; and, (5) addressing fundamental questions of molecular behavior in materials in a manner that will have an impact on a broad range of fields including polymer chemistry, physical organic chemistry, and self-healing and stress-responsive materials. <br/><br/>The overarching technical objective is to lay a quantitative foundation for mechanochemical kinetics by employing state-of-the-art physical measurements and developing new methods for quantitation. Specific experiments include the direct, experimental characterization and quantification of the effect of mechanical forces on covalent reactions triggered along overstretched polymer backbones. Because mechanical force, unlike conventional forms of energy input such as heat or light, is directional, the coupling between mechanical force and reactivity provides insights into the structure of transition states and the shapes of reaction potential energy surfaces. Despite its importance, however, quantitative measures of the effect of force on chemical reactions are rare. This project aims to develop two novel approaches to quantifying mechanochemical reactivity: pulling on single molecules of multi-mechanophore, non-scissile polymers with an atomic force microscope, and the pulsed sonication and molecular weight degradation of multi-mechanophore, scissile polymers. Models for the observed mechanochemical activity enable quantitative assessment of reactivity in both classes of mechanophores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

She is examining chemical reactions of the herbicide dicamba. Although dicamba has been on the market for over thirty years, it is being used more often on agricultural fields now as new genetically-modified soybean plants can tolerate dicamba. The 2017 growing season saw the first use of these soybeans in the US - and by the end of the summer, there were thousands of complaints from farmers on land adjacent to fields. Herbicide drifting through the air appeared to be causing crop damage in down-wind fields. In this project, environmental systems (for example, water or air based systems) are examined to understand how dicamba changes through reactions with other compounds in the environment and through interactions with sunlight. In addition, this project provides research opportunities for undergraduate students, which prepares them to enter the workforce or graduate or professional schools. These students will also help develop and institute a ""Chemistry Night"" for regional high school students.  The team also collaborates with international partners in France.<br/><br/>The photochemistry and reactivity of the chlorinated herbicide dicamba and the impact of additives in formulated agricultural products is being examined from several angles. These include heterogeneous photochemistry on the surface of epicuticular waxes and leaves, gas-phase photochemistry, and heterogeneous reactivity with hydroxyl radical, the primary gas-phase oxidant. The influence of surfactants and inactive ingredients in the commercial formulation of dicamba on these reactions is examined. The results may provide insight into the photodegradation and oxidation mechanisms and (photo)products of dicamba. This research enhances the current understanding of the environmental chemistry of dicamba. This work also provides new methods to examine the photolysis of chemicals sorbed to surfaces and heterogeneous reactions with gas-phase oxidants.

Professor Doyle has designed chemical systems that are capable of controlling the 3-dimensional shape of the products, a feature that is crucial to the synthesis of molecules of medicinal importance. In addition, some of the these cycloaddition reactions use earth-abundant metals to speed up the reaction.

He and his team are using a metal-stabilized three-carbon vinylcarbene that is derived either from a vinyldiazo compound, or a donor-acceptor cyclopropane, to selectively form products containing 4 to 6-membered rings and up to two heteroatoms. Stereoselectivity in these cycloaddition reactions is imparted via chiral ligands, which restrict the approach of a reactant to one side of the vinylcarbene, providing enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.

The tunable chemical reactivity that is accessible by the transfer of electrons is harnessed by Nature in a wide range of important biochemical processes. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration, for example, rely on the exquisite sensitivity and selectivity with which electrons are transferred between molecules. The Buzzeo group is focusing on the chemical properties of the essential trace element selenium, a natural antioxidant, to gain a deeper understanding of its unique role in biological electron transfer events. Their studies provide fundamental information regarding the reactivity distinctly afforded by the presence of this element. Findings from their work also have the potential to result in selective sensing of selenium- and sulfur-containing molecules, including in clinical settings. This project provides multiple interdisciplinary research opportunities for students at Barnard College, a liberal arts undergraduate institution for women, and bolsters the participation of underrepresented groups in the physical sciences via community-based outreach activities involving high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds and individuals with disabilities. The aim is to expose both groups to chemical concepts, applications, and careers that would otherwise appear unattainable or inaccessible.<br/><br/>The accurate measurement of redox potentials is imperative for detailed understanding of how species participate in electron-transfer reactions. Electrochemical studies of chalcogen-containing molecules are hindered by unwanted oxidation and adsorption on electrode surfaces. New electrode materials have been identified that demonstrate great promise for the aqueous measurement of chalcogen-containing redox-active molecules. It has been shown that the intrinsic reactivity between selenium and gold yields a stable and reproducible electrode surface modification that makes accessible diffusional electron transfer of solution-based chalcogen analytes. The Buzzeo group is working to characterize selenium-modified electrodes by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques.  Specifically, they are measuring the electrochemical behavior of biological selenium and sulfur species on selenium-modified gold substrates to obtain fundamental thermodynamic parameters, and using the optimized selenium-modified surfaces to develop a portable electrochemical biosensor for cystine, a known culprit in kidney stone formation. Aided by collaborations across several departments and institutions, the work entails characterization of both surface and solution speciation to build a molecular-level description of the selenium-gold adsorbate layer. Sensing capabilities are assessed through comprehensive electroanalytical study of selenium- and sulfur-containing amino acids, peptides, and ligands. Together these pursuits will yield fundamental knowledge about selenium-gold surface reactivity and will enable measurement of physiologically relevant redox-active species. The work offers Barnard undergraduates research training at the interface of physical, inorganic, analytical, and biological chemistry.

The research activities combine tools from molecular biology, analytical chemistry, and computational modeling. Molecular-level insights are obtained on the chemical factors that control the enzymatic release of inorganic P from complex organic assemblages. The project has three main objectives. First, it studies the activities of phosphatase enzymes with organic assemblages. Second, it addresses the effects of mineral surfaces on enzyme-substrate recognition. Third, the catalytic dynamics in response to external chemical stimuli is modeled. Metabolomics profiling enables the monitoring of catalytic hydrolysis of different organic P assemblages. Isotopes are used to track enzyme catalysis. This provides information on the role of different enzymes in recycling organic P in response to the chemistry of the environmental matrix. Molecular dynamics simulations in concert with the experimental studies illustrate the supramolecular framework responsible for the environmental biotransformation of organic P. The research findings shed light on how biogeochemical factors control phosphatase-mediated inorganic P generation from organic P assemblages.

Lignin is an Earth abundant organic biopolymer that provides the starting point to recycle carbon from plants into the environment.  In this project, the researchers explore pathways for the molecular rearrangement of lignin to form the molecules present in soil, water and sediments.  A postdoctoral associate, graduate students, and several undergraduates are trained to combine geochemistry, fundamental molecular studies, advanced analytical techniques, and modern computational modeling of complex reaction pathways.  This training provides these future scientists with an interdisciplinary experience.  Undergraduate and high school engagement, including diversified recruitment, is included.<br/><br/>In this research project, lignin is subjected to oxidative degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to partially reorganize and polymerize to form humic substances. These humic substances may effectively sequester lignin-derived carbon in contrast to the theory that lignin is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and contribute to greenhouse warming. This research subjects both synthesized and natural lignin to oxidative decomposition by ROS in the presence of aqueous iron species, mimicking environmental oxidation. The study employs Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, multidimensional liquids and solids NMR, and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to discern molecular transformation pathways.  The research also provides new information regarding both the pathways and magnitude with which photochemistry and ROS affect the cycling of terrestrial carbon among Earth's large reservoirs of carbon, impacting the chemistry of terrestrial systems and oceans."

In quantum chemistry, the Stanton group develops and applies computational tools from the class of methods for treating electrons that is known as coupled-cluster theory to enable highly accurate calculations of the properties of molecules that are of interest to experimentalists.  In molecular dynamics, they develop approaches to semiclassical transition state theory, enabling the prediction and understanding of the rates at which chemical reactions take place.

By combining the work in quantum chemistry with the reaction rate theory developments, they can perform accurate studies of chemical reactions involving radicals and biradicals. This latter area of research has significant import in many areas, since the oxygen molecule so vital to life and which constitutes 20% of the atmosphere is a biradical.

Professor Demchenko is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Professor Demchenko's research group is developing new methods for accomplishing reactions that hook two sugar molecules together. These reactions, called glycosylations, are essentially for assembling the types of carbohydrate structures that are prevalent in a wide range of biological processes and applications of the glycolsylation reactions being developed range from therapeutic to diagnostic strategies. Key to the effort is work both better understand and further develop a unique reaction pathway that was discovered by the Demchenko group during the previous funding period.  This discovery is enabling the construction on the bond connecting the two sugars in a highly selective manner. The project lies at the interface of organic, carbohydrate, and mechanistic chemistry, and it is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This study is investigating both mechanistic and practical aspects of the H-bond-mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD) reaction pathway discovered by the PI's group. The goal of the work is to completely control the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation. With this in mind, two phenomena are being investigated. In the first, two previously developed methods, bromine-promoted glycosylation and HAD reaction are being combined in a manner that affords higher stereoselectivity for both alpha- and beta-glycosylation. In the second, conformational switches are being developed as handles for enhancing the utility of the HAD reaction. These endeavors are strategically advancing the field of glycosciences by offering new synthetic capabilities for obtaining challenging glycans and glycoconjugates with better stereocontrol and higher yields. The developed methods are serving to improve the synthesis of key targets from mammalian glycomes and microbial glycans with potential application as therapeutic agents or diagnostic platforms. Successful completion of the proposed research is not only advancing the field of glycosylation, but is also making contributions to the larger chemical, biological, and medical sciences. Integral to the success of this program is the active participation of undergraduate and graduate students who receive solid training in research methods and work to solve synthetic important synthetic challenges.

Lignin is an Earth abundant organic biopolymer that provides the starting point to recycle carbon from plants into the environment.  In this project, the researchers explore pathways for the molecular rearrangement of lignin to form the molecules present in soil, water and sediments.  A postdoctoral associate, graduate students, and several undergraduates are trained to combine geochemistry, fundamental molecular studies, advanced analytical techniques, and modern computational modeling of complex reaction pathways.  This training provides these future scientists with an interdisciplinary experience.  Undergraduate and high school engagement, including diversified recruitment, is included.<br/><br/>In this research project, lignin is subjected to oxidative degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to partially reorganize and polymerize to form humic substances. These humic substances may effectively sequester lignin-derived carbon in contrast to the theory that lignin is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and contribute to greenhouse warming. This research subjects both synthesized and natural lignin to oxidative decomposition by ROS in the presence of aqueous iron species, mimicking environmental oxidation. The study employs Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, multidimensional liquids and solids NMR, and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to discern molecular transformation pathways.  The research also provides new information regarding both the pathways and magnitude with which photochemistry and ROS affect the cycling of terrestrial carbon among Earth's large reservoirs of carbon, impacting the chemistry of terrestrial systems and oceans."

The award is also supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Scientists simulate physical systems and validate their models by comparing the simulation results to experimental results. Once the models have been validated, they are then used to make predictions for regimes inaccessible by experiments or to focus the direction of experiments. These models can range from the subatomic scale of atoms and molecules to global scale, for example weather prediction.   The focus of this proposal is at the atomic and molecular scale.  A typical use for molecular simulation is in the determination of the structure of proteins. The ideal for practitioners of molecular simulation will be to simulate systems at experimental spatial scale, about a trillion trillion atoms, and at experimental times, for seconds.  The most powerful computers today (upwards of 100000 processors) only allow for simulations on the order of a billion atoms and one-ten thousandth of a second. The overarching goal of this work is to develop methods that help shrink and ultimately eliminate this bottleneck.<br/><br/>Accurate molecular simulations of biochemical systems require accurate computations of the electrostatic interactions. The predominant approach of modeling an atom as a sphere and thus the electron density as a point charge fails to capture the anisotropy inherent in electrostatic interaction. Multipolar electrostatics provides a much more refined description of the electronic environment and hence the promise of more accurate simulations of biochemical systems. In multipolar electrostatic interactions the charge densities of chemical species are described by higher order multipoles instead of only fixed-point charges. The fixed-point charge is the zero order or monopole term of a multipolar electrostatic model. The accuracy attained by the model increases with increasing multipole order with a related increase in computational cost. The prohibitive cost of multipolar interactions has been a barrier to the model being widely adopted. Interactions with multipoles up to second order are typically an order of magnitude more expensive than corresponding fixed-point charges. Boateng and coworkers develop three related but different parallel treecode methods to accelerate multipolar electrostatics for molecular simulations. The methods are based on similar methods developed and studied by  Professor Boateng for fixed point charge models. The methods split particle-particle interactions into near and far field interactions. The near-field interactions are evaluated exactly and the far-field interactions are approximated using a Cartesian Taylor expansion. The algorithms are developed for both free space and periodic boundary conditions to ensure they are useful for a broad range of molecular simulation applications. The advantages of the treecode, aside from the speedup it offers, includes good parallel scalability, low memory requirement, suitability for complex geometries and relative ease of implementation. The methods developed will be tested on several practical examples in chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NOM plays a role in aquatic pollutant distribution and transformation, but exactly how and to what extent remains unclear. This study focuses on finding the effect of NOM particle size and surface constituents on the uptake and photochemical breakdown of organic contaminants. The projects provide undergraduate students with a unique opportunity to perform hands-on experiments.

Nickel-containing superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) is the only redox-active nickel-enzyme that is present in aerobes despite the presence of ROS (reactive oxygen species)-sensitive cysteine-S-ligands at its active site. This project involves the preparation and investigation of synthetic models of the nickel-containing active site of NiSOD that are capable of aerobic function. In particular, the project will examine the role of the entities that are bound to nickel, in dictating the catalytic properties of the active site. Plans are in place to provide hands-on research opportunities in the fundamental chemical sciences to groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. One such plan, with which there was prior success, is to provide a summer research internship and lifelong career mentorship to undergraduate chemistry majors from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the southeast region. The PI and his group will also participate in the University of Georgia Young Dawgs program where high school students from the Clarke County public school system are provided STEM research internships.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to prepare synthetic model complexes of the nickel center found at the active site of NiSOD, and to investigate the mechanistic role that the coordinated peptide-N and cysteinate-S ligands play in the redox mechanism of this enzyme. Nickel-cysteine sites in biology are central catalysts that participate in reactions of global impact including the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), fixation of cellular carbon, and the generation of alternative energy supplies, i.e., hydrogen evolution/consumption. Nickel enzymes and their corresponding synthetic models are thus ideal systems to promote chemical transformations of high economic and environmental importance. However, the majority of these nickel-enzymes are found in strict anaerobic organisms.  Despite the sensitive nature of cysteine-S with ROS, these donor atoms appear inert to ROS during turnover in the enzyme. Advanced synthetic techniques will be employed to construct N/S-containing ligand frames and their corresponding Ni(III/II) complexes that accurately reproduce the NiSOD active site. Key factors in the design of these constructs are the incorporation of an axial N-donor and the ability to fine-tune the nucleophilicity of the S-ligands in order to promote Ni-based versus S-based redox chemistry. Spectroscopic, structural and computational techniques will be utilized. The project aims to determine the geometric and electronic structural properties of these Ni(III/II)-N/S complexes and investigate their reactivity with ROS and other reactive small molecules, such as NO, to shed light on the redox mechanism taking place at this unique nickel site."

Together with their students, the faculty members seek to develop an environmentally-friendly approach to purifying water. Water contamination by highly toxic arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) is a serious threat to the environment.  This has affected the health of hundreds of millions of humans globally.

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop more fully the understanding of intermolecular interactions, how they are affected by, and in turn how they affect the first encounters between molecules.  The undergraduate researchers working on this project receive significant research experiences in an active physical chemistry laboratory as part of a their liberal arts and sciences education and are given the opportunity to present their work at scientific conferences.  This raises the scientific literacy and sharpens the thoughts of student participants, preparing them as future scientists.<br/><br/>Intermolecular interactions are investigated through the analysis of rotational spectra obtained using Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) techniques. The availability of two types of FTMW spectrometers (chirped pulse and Balle-Flygare) provides key research and pedagogic advantages as well as enhancing undergraduate participation in scientific research. The determination of the structures of a series of gas-phase dimeric complexes, in combination with ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, provides information regarding the nature of the forces responsible. Specifically, complexes formed between protic acids and haloethylenes reveal the effects of dispersion interactions on intermolecular association. The laser ablation technique is used to generate metal containing complexes in which electron transfer is expected to play a role, and effects of intermolecular interactions on the electron density of the hydroxyl (OH) radical are studied using complexes involving this open-shell species."

Professor Blakemore and his students are exploring a new method for the preparation of alkenes, a class of carbon-based molecules. These substances are of value to many fields including medicine, agriculture, and engineering. Alkenes can exist in either of two geometrical forms. It is essential to control which form of an alkene is prepared because the two types have different physical and biological properties. The chemical reactions developed at OSU enable either geometrical form of an alkene to be made selectively. This research advances the education of students spanning levels of experience from high school, to undergraduate, to graduate, and post-doctoral. In addition, Professor Blakemore foster the participation of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the physical sciences.<br/><br/>This research introduces a new approach for stereocontrolled alkene synthesis based on eliminative cross-coupling of enantioenriched sp3-hybridized carbenoids. By contrast to traditional strategies for alkene synthesis, which cannot wholly control stereochemistry, the method developed in this research does not rely on differentiated substituents to bias generation of one isomer over the other. Rather, interplay between pre-existing absolute stereochemical features within the carbenoid subunits is exploited to steer formation of the carbon-carbon double bond toward the desired stereoisomer. To explore the scope of this new method while demonstrating its relevance to society, complex alkene containing bioactive compounds are prepared alongside simpler models.  These include a P-glycoprotein stimulator (a potential therapeutic for Alzeheimer's disease), vitamin D3 (a secosteroid with multiple applications), and pumiliotoxin 251D (an alkaloid with sodium ion channel activity).  The next generation of scientists is nurtured.  High school students participating in statewide summer internship programs are hosted within Professor Blakemore's laboratory."

Currently, novel color-changing materials made of plastic or polymers can be designed so that their colors can be tuned from purple to red and their transparency from absolutely clear to completely opaque. Flexible filters made from these polymers can block or deflect harmful short wavelengths (like those that cause sunburn) and transmit long wavelengths useful for sun-illuminated heating. Most of the filters known today are fixed for a particular function and cannot be changed after fabrication. It is possible to change the color and transparency of these filters using light, the chemical environment, or small applied electric fields. The potential uses of these novel structures are to facilitate intelligent light harvesting for flexible solar cells at dusk or dawn and to create wearable electronics that allow the continuous monitoring of the wearer's health. Further, this work has an impact in regard to chemistry education and teaching through the development of select in-house tutorials defining the fundamental aspects of conjugated polymer synthesis and electrochemistry that are required in order for one to be conversant in these technologies. A broader impact of this project is the enhanced training of graduate and undergraduate students with an emphasis on their early involvement in interdisciplinary, fundamental research with active recruitment of underrepresented groups. To broaden the scope of these efforts, webinar tutorials are developed and made available through a website that uses WIKI software for release to the general scientific community. This work impacts energy sciences, polymer and materials chemistry, electrochemistry, and organic electronics.<br/><br/>The merit of this cross-disciplinary study is the development of a fundamental understanding of the behavior and driving molecular mechanisms of electrochemically-driven transformations of macromolecules.  These transformations affect the supramolecular organization, redox state, and the balance of electronic and ionic conductivities of macromolecules in proximity to inorganic interfaces. The various processes associated with electrochromic behavior are investigated utilizing a series of newly synthesized polymers deposited on metal interfaces. The work includes synthesis of novel water-soluble and processable conjugated polyelectrolytes with variations in band gap, color, and oxidation potential. The assembly of interfacial polymer layers around noble metal nanostructures balances local and global polymer chain conformation, charge, and redox potential distribution.  These factors are critical for controlling the optical properties of the polymers including absorbance, refractive index, and plasmonic interactions during electrochemical oxidation.

Discovering novel molecules and materials that are optimal for capturing energy from the sun or fighting disease in the human body requires detailed knowledge of the distributions of their electrons.  Electrons, however, are very small particles; in fact, they are 1000 times less massive than a single hydrogen atom. Consequently, electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics.  Like Schrdinger's famous cat, who is paradoxically both half alive and half dead simultaneously, electrons can be found in two or more physical states at the same time.  When electrons in a molecule occupy many more states than the number of electrons, the electrons in the molecule are described by scientists as being strongly correlated (or entangled).  Strongly correlated electrons are present in some of the most fascinating molecules and materials from the transition-metal catalysts in nitrogen fixation to the copper-oxide planes in high-temperature superconductors. Despite the importance of strongly correlated electrons, however, the computational cost of describing them by the laws of quantum mechanics traditionally increases exponentially with the number of electrons, dramatically limiting the number of strongly correlated systems describable by theoretical chemistry and physics.   In this project, Mazziotti and his research group are further developing a novel approach to strongly correlated molecules in which the energies and properties are computed as functions of only two electrons in the ""sea"" of charge from the remaining electrons.  These so-called two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) methods are able to treat strongly correlated molecules efficiently and accurately with a computational cost that does not grow exponentially when the system becomes large. Recently, the 2-RDM method has been applied to several interesting and very different types of chemical systems, for example to model the efficient release of energy in firefly bioluminescence.  Mazziotti and his research group are currently working to extend the 2-RDM methods to larger molecular systems as well as time-dependent phenomena with important implications for describing molecules in studies ranging from materials to medicine.  Mazziotti also produces a journal for high school students named E = mc2 which publishes research by students.  The journal provides a forum for encouraging high school students to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.    <br/><br/>The many-electron wave function contains much more information than necessary to compute the important energies and properties of molecules and materials.  Because electrons are indistinguishable with pairwise interactions, however, the wave function as the basic variable of quantum mechanics can be replaced by the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM).  With support from the NSF, Mazziotti and his research group are building upon their recent advances in 2-RDM methods with an emphasis on developing and improving 2-RDM methods for treating ground and excited states as well as time-dependent quantum systems.  Several significant advances in the direct calculation of the 2-RDM for strongly correlated systems are being pursued including: (1) a low-scaling 2-RDM method, which can strongly correlate hundreds of orbitals, corresponding to wave functions that are intractable by conventional methods, and (2) a steady-state 2-RDM method that can determine the conductance of a molecule or material even in the presence of strong electron correlation.    The research has important applications to modeling and predicting the electronic energies and properties including conductivity of a wide range of large strongly correlated molecular systems."

They seek to better understand how to transform and degrade highly persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that contaminate water. PFASs are critical components in many commercial and industrial products, including fire-suppressing foams. There is growing evidence that PFASs are contaminating many drinking water sources throughout the country. There are significant human risks of exposure to PFASs. The exceptional chemical stability of PFASs prevents destruction with conventional approaches to water purification. However, recent research reveals that hydrated electrons, strong reducing agents that can be generated by UV light, can effectively treat some PFAS chemicals. Broader development of this promising strategy requires a better understanding of the fundamental reaction mechanisms and links between PFAS molecular structures and their reactivity with hydrated electrons. The research provides opportunities to teach K-12 students and teachers, and undergraduate college students about the sources, impacts, and treatment of fluorochemicals and other contaminants of emerging concern.<br/><br/>A serious environmental issue is the motivation for this research. The project aims to advance fundamental mechanistic understanding and structure-activity relationships of PFAS reactions with hydrated electrons. The study combines laser flash photolysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) experimental methods with quantum chemical calculations. This allows the establishment of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for predicting reaction rates between hydrated electron and diverse PFAS chemical structures.

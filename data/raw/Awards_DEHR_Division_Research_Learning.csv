This project will focus on the integration of computer science and mathematics through data science in after-school data-science clubs and camps in rural and urban settings with middle school youth. The project will create modules for teaching and learning data science that can be shared with educators in informal and formal settings. The modules will engage youth in conducting their own data investigations using computer tools for engaging with large and small data sets. Data science education is a new field and the project will contribute to developing knowledge about how to best teach data science and how to create effective learning environments for students. The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).<br/><br/>The project will use a design-based research framework to develop, test, and revise the learning modules in urban and rural settings. The data science concepts include variability in data, organizing data, data structure, data representations, and statistical reasoning. These concepts are connected to both mathematics and computer science concepts. The project seeks to develop knowledge about how to design learning environments for students to learn data science using computational tools.  The research questions include examining the design of the units and students' learning about data science concepts. The data to be collected include interviews with students, observations from the after-school clubs and camps, and students' work from the modules. Educators who lead the learning experiences will also provide feedback to inform revision and implementation."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will expand the DRK-12 portfolio by contributing to a limited program portfolio on data science, and also by being responsive to a broader, national discourse on data science, exemplified in the data-dependent scientific practices emphasis in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). With the impetus toward data literacy, an acute need has emerged for high quality evidence-based models, practices, and tools to better prepare high school teachers to teach data skills and for students to develop the problem solving and analytical skills needed to interpret and understand data, particularly in the sciences. This project will address these challenges by leveraging novel research and design approaches, using digital tools and two well-established online instructional platforms; Zoom In and Common Online Data Analysis Platform.<br/><br/>With a user base of over 27,000 teachers and students, the existing Zoom In platform has proven successful in fostering evidence-based inquiry among social studies teachers. This project will test the feasibility of the platform to facilitate data-focused inquiry and skill development among high school science teachers and their students. In Year 1, two NGSS-aligned digital curriculum modules and supporting materials focused on scientific phenomena and problems in biology and earth science will be developed for high school science teachers and embedded in a modified iteration of Zoom In. The Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) will be integrated into the modules to make hierarchical data structures, modeling, visualizations, and dynamic linking possible within Zoom In. A pilot and usability test will be conducted with 16 teachers and 100 students from diverse New York City public high schools. Two teacher focus groups and think-aloud sessions with the students will be held. In Year 2, the remaining four modules will be developed. Guided by four research questions, field testing with teachers and students will be done to assess the content, CODAP data tools, Zoom-in student supports, teacher supports, and outcome measures. In Year 3, final revisions to the tools will be completed. A small-scale efficacy test will be conducted to assess aspects of the implementation process, practices, and overall impact of the modules on student learning. For the efficacy study, a two-level cluster-randomized design will be employed to randomly assign schools to the Zoom In intervention. A comparison group will use another existing well-designed data literacy digital instructional platform but without key aspects of Zoom In. Outcome measures will be administered at the beginning and end of the school year to the treatment and comparison groups. Back-end data, observational data, and teacher log data will be collected and analyzed. Qualitative data will be gathered from teacher and student observations and interviews and analyzed. Researchers will analyze the impact on student learning using hierarchical linear models with an effect treatment condition and student-and-class-level covariates. The research findings will be broadly disseminated through the Zoom In platform, conferences, publications, and social media."

Preparing today's students to work with data fluently is critical to ensuring a scientifically literate and empowered citizenry. But most efforts to incorporate data analysis into the K-12 curriculum are limited to short, isolated activities; basic skills development; or, are introduced as new courses devoted specifically to data and computing, limiting both the potential benefits and the audience for such efforts. This project seeks to integrate computational data analysis into the middle school science curriculum in a longitudinal, interdisciplinary way - drawing from the computer and data sciences, literacy studies, statistics, and science education to saturate the classroom with relevant tools, resources, and support. Middle school classrooms will analyze and draw conclusions about publicly available scientific datasets using a free, innovative, computational data analysis platform called the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP). Units will be designed specifically with Dual Language Learners (DLL) in mind, inviting students to share their investigations by writing multimodal texts that blend both familiar and academic modes of expression to explain and contextualize their data analysis processes. Units that build on one another in difficulty and complexity will be introduced throughout the academic year, and participating teachers will receive significant training opportunities. Overall the project is anticipated to directly impact approximately 2,500 students and 20 teachers in the greater San Francisco Bay area, from predominantly high needs schools.<br/><br/>The project will provide a research context to address the following questions: How do students learn, over time, to use computational tools to structure, calculate, filter, and transform data for scientific inquiry? What patterns of engagement in scientific practices are supported by the integration of computational data analysis and visualizations into the science curriculum? And, what new literacy practices might support DLL and learners with limited access to technology or who are still developing academic literacy in constructing oral and written arguments and explanations using data and visualizations as evidence? Specifically, it brings together and seeks to extend three complementary research constructs. Data moves are the computational actions analysts take to transform and analyze datasets. Syncretic texts are specialized texts that blend academic discourse, such as the formulae and statistical language needed to explain data analysis, with the familiar modes of expression (including home languages and alternative forms of expression such as video, art, animation, etc.), which has been found to invite a wide range of marginalized students to experiment with and develop academic language. Finally, a community of learners approach allows different student groups in a classroom to conduct and share the results of different investigations with the same dataset, making the exploration of large and complex data more feasible in everyday classrooms. Analyses will make use of video, CODAP log data, students' written texts, and pre-post assessments to investigate learning and participation longitudinally over the course of an entire academic year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is supported by the STEM+C program and advances its mission by integrating computational thinking, data literacy, and statistical concepts with a field-based STEM curriculum model for middle school students that focuses on science fields associated with habitat monitoring and restoration. This integration will be accomplished through: (1) Expansion and further development of Restoration Hubs in and near the water of New York Harbor that support field science experiences; (2) Professional learning opportunities for teachers that feature integration of computational thinking with other STEM disciplines; (3) Development of curriculum units that promote learning of computer science and data science concepts and skills, and raise awareness of education pathways to careers in computing, data sciences, and habitat restoration sciences; and (4) A summer STEM Institute for computer science and computing.<br/><br/>This project will augment a large-scale design and development project that is testing a model of community-based science education in an urban environment.  The existing curriculum model focuses on key concepts in the geological, environmental, and biological sciences that are associated with monitoring environmental conditions and habitat restoration. This project will enhance the existing model by integrating data literacy, computational thinking and relevant statistical concepts and skills into the existing curriculum, enabling students to gain new skills and competencies associated with gathering and analyzing large amounts of field data associated with environmental monitoring and habitat restoration. Data to be analyzed range from basic water chemistry data to data associated with bacterial monitoring and environmental DNA sampling and analyses.

Driven by rapid technological change, the United States is facing a critical workforce shortage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. Furthermore, employers across all fields are increasingly seeking employees who possess computational thinking and data science and analytics skill sets. Eighty percent of the nation's colleges and universities are classified as small institutions and enroll 5,000 or fewer students. Many of these small colleges and universities are grounded in the liberal arts and have a tradition of infusing personalized learning and common thought across disciplines within their general education curricula. This makes them particularly well-suited for preparing students in human literacy, technological literacy, and data literacy. Because computational thinking and data science and analytics work is most often conducted digitally, it is imperative that students learn these skills in digital environments to prepare them for what they will encounter in the workplace. The next generation of digital learning environments encompassing five areas (interoperability; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessment; collaboration; and accessibility and universal learning design) will be used by students to learn data science and analytics skill sets. Small colleges and universities often lack the financial resources to build the necessary human and technological infrastructure to support digital learning. This workshop will design digital learning environments that will meet the substantial need for data science and analytics-educated professionals, promote equity in learning, and assist small liberal arts colleges and universities to contribute to the early development of these efforts. Experts will advise teams to design digital science and analytics curricula that will be incorporated in blueprint designs for next generation of digital learning environments meeting the needs of learners and the workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to convene a workshop that results in blueprint designs of next generation of digital learning environments to answer the question - How can science, technology, and mathematics digital learning environments be designed to enhance the digital science and data analytic skill competencies of learners at small liberal arts institutions of higher education? The research questions include: 1) How will the innovative digital learning environments prepare students for employment that requires data science and analytics? 2) How will the design of data science and analytics digital learning environments account for the variability of learners? 3) How will data be collected and learning environments assessed to measure students' data science and analytics competency? 4) How will a national consortium form and function to sustain and expand the workshop outcomes? Based on the tradition in small liberal arts colleges and universities of offering personalized learning, universal design learning for technology will be emphasized and serve as a model for supporting more underrepresented students in STEM to persist to graduation. The complexity of data sciences and analytics skill sets require an assessment of the workshop participants' progress toward meeting the planned outcomes, and education on individual motivations, both which are done through team science. Team science is also innovatively incorporated into the data science and analytics undergraduate curriculum design to educate students how their skills can contribute to a greater product that is the result of the collective contribution of the multidisciplinary team. The project draws upon the expertise of national experts who provide content knowledge not otherwise available to small liberal arts colleges and universities. The forming of a national consortium for digital learning at small liberal arts colleges and universities will sustain and expand the workshop outcomes. It will provide authentic hands-on digital learning research experience through curriculum innovations that introduce students to computational thinking, data science, and analytic skills. The result will be prepared students who fit the workforce need in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Post-secondary educational institutions are being buffeted by three major transitions: changes in the nature of the competencies students need and want, changes in the demographic mix of people that they serve, and changes in the technologies and strategies available to build, measure, and communicate competence and expertise. Powerful new information technologies, unprecedented opportunities to gather and analyze large volumes of data, and new insights into how people learn, make it possible to imagine designing learning environments that make learning more productive, more affordable, and more gracefully adaptable to individuals throughout their lifetimes.  The new field of learning analytics has made major advances in understanding how educational Big Data can produce insights to improve classroom practices. Yet, a number of critical questions remain unanswered in important areas to ensure all Americans receive the education they need to prosper in a modern economy. The aim of this workshop is to investigate the role of learning analytics in contributing to advances in technological learning environments. <br/><br/>The workshop will bring together interdisciplinary experts to articulate the state-of-the-art and propose research priorities for learning analytics in the coming decade.  A central theme will be to explore new ways to use powerful tools in data science (machine learning, social network analysis, analytics and visualization of complex data, temporal, multi-scale and statistical models, integration of heterogeneous data, data scrubbing, wrangling and provenance tracking, data privacy and cybersecurity) to define competence, measure it, and build it using a rich array of new approaches to study learning. The workshop will also explore how the full power of these tools can be applied to the most critical challenges faced in learning analytics. The outcome of the workshop will be a clear definition of the highest priority research needs in learning analytics and a practical roadmap to guide public and private research support in these areas. The resulting white paper will provide insights to improve a wide range of learning environment contexts in in post-secondary education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current proposal seeks to develop ways to curate and structure learning activities in and outside of schools in ways that engage youth in long-term projects, demonstrate both the personal and professional value of computer programming, and exemplify computation as a means to achieve creative and personally fulfilling goals. The project explores a model for broadening participation in computer science and related fields through a three-pronged approach involving programming, music, and dance. First, the researchers will provide learners with tools that engage them in computational projects that are personally, socially, and culturally meaningful. Second, the project will develop a continuum of music-themed computer science learning opportunities designed to work between and across school and out-of-school spaces. Finally, the project will create and study innovative ways for learners to document their emerging understandings of both computer programming and music by adopting the computational notebook paradigm that is increasingly popular in data science and computational science communities (e.g., Jupyter, Wolfram Notebooks).<br/><br/>One premise of the research is that music is a dominant cultural form of literacy with many direct parallels to computer science concepts. Emerging genres in the digital arts have the potential to provide a motivational context for youth from groups chronically underrepresented in computing fields. The researchers will introduce students to computational thinking through two programming environments developed at Georgia Institute of Technology. A set of activities and programs across a network of learning spaces will also be designed to immerse students in computer programming. The researchers will use a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, and artifact analysis, to document student learning across contexts and over time. By engaging with multiple partners in the researcher-practitioner partnerships, the researchers will develop a rich understanding of youth engagement and the ways that learning can be supported and reinforced across contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This Integrating Chemistry and Earth science (ICE) project will design, develop, and test a new curriculum unit for high school chemistry courses that is organized around the question, ""How does chemistry shape where I live?""  The new unit will integrate relevant Earth science data, scientific practices, and key urban environmental research findings with the chemistry curriculum to gain insights into factors that support the approach to teaching and learning advocated by current science curriculum standards.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop teacher capacity to teach and evaluate student abilities to use the practices of scientists and concepts from Earth science and chemistry to understand important phenomena in their immediate, familiar environments.  The project has the potential to serve as a model for how to make cutting edge science directly accessible to all students.  The project is a collaborative effort that engages scientists, science education researchers, curriculum developers, school curriculum and instruction leaders, and science teachers in the longer term challenge of infusing Earth science concepts and practices across the core high school science courses.<br/><br/>Current guidelines and standards for science education promote learning that engages students in three interrelated dimensions: disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting ideas.  This project is guided by the hypothesis that when provided sustained opportunities to engage in three-dimensional learning experiences, in an integrated Earth science and chemistry context, students will improve in their ability to demonstrate the coordination of disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts when solving problems and developing explanations related to scientific phenomena. This project will employ a design based research approach, and during the two development-enactment-analysis-and-redesign cycles, the project team will collect student assessment data, teacher interview data, observational data from lessons, teacher surveys, and reflective teacher logbooks. These collected data will provide information about how teachers implement the lessons, what students do during the lessons, and what students learn from them that will lead to better design and a better understanding of student learning. This information will be used to inform the modification of lessons from cycle to cycle, and to inform the professional development materials for teachers.  The research agenda for the project is guided by the following questions: 1. What are the design features of ICE lessons that support teachers in enacting three-dimensional instruction within the context of their classroom?  2. What are the design features of embedded three-dimensional assessments that yield useful classroom data for teachers and researchers regarding their students' abilities to integrate core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts? 3. What is the nature of student learning related to disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts that results from students' engagement in ICE lesson sets? 4. What differences emerge in student engagement and learning outcomes for ICE lessons that incorporate local phenomena or data sets as compared to lessons that do not? 5. What contextual factors (i.e., school context, administrative support, time constraints, etc.) influence teachers' implementation of three-dimensional instruction embedded within ICE lessons?"

In this exploratory Change Makers project, the Concord Consortium will develop, test, and evaluate a citizen science program that leverages innovative technology, such that youth engage directly with energy issues through scientific inquiry.  The project will create the Infrared Street View, a citizen science program that aims to produce a thermal version of Google's Street View using an affordable infrared camera attached to a smartphone. The infrared camera serves as a high-throughput data acquisition instrument that collects thousands of temperature data points each time a picture is taken. Youth will collect massive geotagged thermal data that have considerable scientific and educational value for visualizing energy usage and improving energy efficiency at all levels. The Infrared Street View program will provide a Web-based platform for youth and anyone interested in energy efficiency to view and analyze the aggregated data to identify possible energy losses. By sharing their scientific findings with stakeholders, youth will make changes to the way energy is being used. The project will start with school, public, and commercial buildings in selected areas where performing thermal scan of the buildings and publishing their thermal images for educational and research purposes are permitted by school leaders, town officials, and property owners. In collaboration with high schools and out-of-school programs in Massachusetts, this project will conduct pilot-tests with approximately 200 students. <br/><br/>To contribute to advancing learning, the study will probe three research questions: 1) Under what circumstances can technology bridge out-of-school and classroom science learning and improve learning on both sides? 2) To what extent can unobtrusive assessment based on data mining support research and evaluation of student learning in out-of-school settings? and 3) To what extent can instructional intelligence built into the app used in the program help students learn in out-of-school programs and improve the quality of data they contribute to the citizen science project? Data sources for investigating these questions include students' interaction data with the app logged behind the scenes and the images they have taken, as well as results based on traditional assessments from a small number of participants. Throughout the project, staff will widely disseminate project products and findings through the Internet, science fairs, conferences, publications, and partner networks. An eight-member Advisory Board consisting of cleantech experts, science educators, and educational researchers will oversee and evaluate this project."

This project will advance research and development of new transdisciplinary approaches to computational STEM teaching and learning that will integrate computational thinking through data visualizations, the scientific practice of argumentation from evidence, and earth science concepts focused on geohazards. The team will develop a open-source scaffolded programming tool for data visualizations, and two curricular modules on geohazards for middle and high school aligned with Next Generation Science Standards. Integration of computational thinking and science practices will occur as students transform real-world GPS data into manageable and interpretative visualizations using the programming tool and use them as evidence to formulate scientific arguments about predicting the impact of geohazards. The resulting products can serve as exemplars for curriculum developers, researchers, and educators to integrate computational data visualization practices with disciplinary STEM learning, and inform strategies to support teachers and students when implementing these practices.

First, design-based research will be conducted to refine the tool and curriculum modules, develop assessments for students' content learning and argumentation practices, and identify teacher supports necessary for implementing this type of curriculum module in classroom.  Second, a delayed cohort pre-post-test design will investigate the impact of integrating the computational practice of data visualization on student learning. The project will reach 800 students and 12 teachers, and be implemented in a wide range of schools including those that serve underrepresented students in STEM.

The project will target students outside mathematics and statistics classes who seldom have opportunities formally make sense of large-scale quantitative data. The population for the initial study will be humanities/social studies and mathematics/statistics high school teachers and their classes. The focus on social justice themes are intended to engage students with content that resonates with their interests. This strategy has the potential to demonstrate ways to provide rich, meaningful statistical instruction to a population that seldom has the opportunity for such learning. By capturing students' imagination and interest with social justice themes, this project has the potential of high impact in today's society where understanding and preparing statistical reports are becoming more critical to the general populace. <br/><br/>This project will build on prior theory and research to develop a new set of statistics learning materials, with data visualization tools and an applied social science focus to design three 2-week applied data investigations (self-contained modules) addressing real-world socioeconomic questions with large-scale social science data. The modules will be aligned with the high school Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and key statistical content for college students. The purpose of the study is to strengthen existing theories of how to design classroom learning materials to support two primary sets of outcomes for high school students, particularly among those historically underrepresented in STEM fields: 1) stronger understandings of important statistics concepts and data analysis practices, and 2) interest in statistics and working with data.  The modules will engage students in a four-step investigative process where they will (1) formulate questions that can be answered with data; (2) design and implement a plan to assemble appropriate data; (3) use numerical and graphical methods to explore the data; and (4) summarize conclusions relating back to the original questions and citing relevant components of the analysis that support their interpretation and acknowledging other interpretations.<br/><br/>The project will employ a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) design using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine results of targeted outcomes (noted above) as well track whether there is any evidence to support the conjectures that key module components directly impact targeted student outcomes.

This project addresses that mission by developing and testing computing-based science investigations for an Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course, and for additional learning modules for use by teachers and students in middle school and high school not engaged in AP courses.  The project will be implemented through a state-wide network of schools in Rhode Island having diverse student populations, and will provide professional development experiences for teachers in participating schools.  The learning modules to be developed will integrate use of data and observations with computing to create conceptual models that simulate or predict natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, coastal resiliency, trends in the spread of infectious diseases, bioaccumulation of toxins in fish, the incidence of radon in homes, or other phenomena associated with emerging societal issues.       <br/><br/>This design and development project will develop at least six proof-of-concept computing-based scientific investigations for use in science or computing classes.  The investigations will each be grounded in the core science fields (life sciences, physical sciences, or Earth and space sciences), but the content and implications of the learning modules will span a broad range of interdisciplinary topics that focus on societal issues or potential hazards that require behavioral or engineering solutions.  Each topic will require students to access data from science or engineering publications, or from national data archives maintained by agencies such as NASA, NIH, NOAA, or USGS, and incorporate these data into the development or testing of their conceptual or computer models of natural phenomena.  The investigations will be aligned with performance expectations advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards for disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.  Research questions for the project will focus on student and teacher skills in using computational thinking to understand, learn, or teach; the influence of computational thinking on attitudes toward science, engineering, and computing; and factors influencing the learning and teaching of computational thinking.  The learning modules to be developed will first be piloted within AP courses having diverse student populations at three Career and Technical Centers, with subsequent implementations in schools throughout the collaboration network.

Spectroscopy is the single most important diagnostic tool in the sciences, and is required for inquiry at the frontiers of science across many disciplines, yet is unavailable to most classrooms. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory proposes to design, implement, and investigate the impact on students of an innovative curriculum supplement called the Spectrum Laboratory. The Spectrum Lab will be an online, interactive learning environment that enables students to make use of the database of publicly available spectra from research scientists, as well as from students. The online learning resource and associated materials are purposefully being developed and tested with a demographically diverse set of schools. The project will determine how the design of a spectroscopy workspace can help students to use spectra while gaining fluency with a range of important science practices. The project's significance and importance is to greatly increase the opportunities for high school students to engage in authentic inquiry. Being able to evaluate and interpret real-world data is a hallmark of data literacy that is developed with Spectrum Lab. Project will potentially benefit the field through advances with respect to education and diversity, and benefit society by equipping high school students with the perceptual and cognitive factors that promote students' reasoning about spectra. <br/><br/>The Spectrum Lab's initial design applies research-based principles recommended for educational interfaces that engage students with graphical data advancing knowledge from prior research into understanding of how students make sense of spectroscopic data and its graphical representations. The project will be developed in collaboration with partner teachers in up to eight high school classrooms, representing a diverse population of learners, and then tested with a national group of 20 teachers with 600 to 800 students. A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures, including pre/post surveys and assessments, analysis of student project work, classroom video, and teacher surveys, will help address researcher's questions about students' experiences with the Spectrum Lab. The data to be gathered will be used to iteratively improve the design of the laboratory to aid students understand the source of these authentic data coming from spectroscopy to address real-world science questions of interest and importance to them. The Spectrum Lab will enable students to engage in a broad range of inquiry projects that were previously inaccessible, including projects near the frontiers of science. The students will become involved in their authentic inquiry projects, where each activity engages them in key science practices, including generating model spectrum plots to make predictions, assessing and interpreting data, and reasoning from evidence (and models) in support of a claim. The students will be using graphs of well-documented experiments and in physics, more challenging graphs of spectra of less familiar wavelength axis. The students in chemistry will learn how to relate the bright lines observed in an atom's spectrum to energy levels of the atom.  There will be studies that track students' eye movements show that students associate the peaks or valleys of a spectrum with individual atoms in a molecule, rather than with the overall properties of the molecule. The resources developed by the project will be freely available online for teachers and researchers. The Spectrum Lab is an advance in education technology that uses modern tools for enabling interactive data visualization. Its features enable students to integrate and apply the most important elements of science practice, such as the ability to draw evidence-based conclusions, as well as the ability to gather, evaluate and interpret data, intended to help students' science practice more closely resemble how research is done. The Spectrum Lab will modernize a critical part of high-school science classrooms, help teachers meet the expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards, and will better prepare students for college work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Comp Hydro project will address the goals of the STEM+C program, as well as an urgent issue facing society: the availability of clean water as an ecosystem service supporting human uses and ecological integrity.  The vision of Comp Hydro is to foster water and computational science literacy by integrating authentic, place- and data-based learning as high school students build and use physical, mathematical and conceptual models.  The approaches and resources of Comp Hydro will be developed in a broad diversity of settings - types of schools and school systems, student and teacher populations, instructional contexts, and regional challenges and constraints on water quality and availability. Teams in four locations around the country will adapt surface water- and groundwater-themed computer modules to local environmental and school contexts, will pilot test them in high school Earth and environmental science classes, and will partner in education research on student and teacher STEM learning. Approximately 2,400 students will be involved with and benefit from the project. The diverse nature of the participating school districts will both engage a demographically diverse student population in STEM and help the project achieve significant broader impacts, by assuring that the findings and tools developed reflect the needs of a broad diversity of people and places.   Through curricular resource creation and professional development for teachers, Comp Hydro will help to build the capacity of each school district to integrate computational and environmental science.  Instructional materials based on learning progressions will support students in developing water science literacy required for informed citizen decision-making. <br/><br/>The Comp Hydro project will address one of the most daunting challenges to developing scientific literacy in students: integrating teaching and learning of key ideas and practices of place-based environmental science with computational and quantitative science in authentic, innovative and effective ways. The basic premise of the project is that to achieve model-based reasoning in environmental science, a student needs to concurrently develop more sophisticated computational reasoning. Four curriculum/professional development modules will be developed to integrate Earth system and computational thinking content.  They will focus on these computational concepts and practices: ability to access and manipulate data from multiple sources; ability to use computational tools to develop models, analyze data, produce data visualizations, and identify key trends; application of computational reasoning and model-based understanding to construct quantitative, scientific explanations and predictions regarding hydrologic systems.  The project will: 1) develop and refine instructional units for surface and groundwater, each comprising two 1-week modules, 2) engage teachers as partners and agents of dissemination, 3) study teacher and student learning, 4) explore supports and constraints on teaching, and 5) build a platform for project research and development and dissemination. The project will engage four teams of 6 teachers, who will work over two school years with educators and scientists at four diverse sites (Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, and Montana).  Comp Hydro will utilize a design-based research approach, grounded in learning progressions as a theoretical and methodological frame, for both its research and instructional materials. The project will integrate computational and data sense making practices and understandings into the Water Systems Learning Progression. It will produce a trajectory of learning and associated assessment instruments that can describe how students become more sophisticated with respect to integrated scientific practices, including analyzing, interpreting and representing data; developing and using models; using computational thinking; and constructing scientific explanations and predictions about hydrologic systems. The project also will develop a set of design principles, and an associated computer platform for broader dissemination and for supporting teachers in integrating the use of big and small data sets into meaningful environmental science learning experiences with high school students."

Building on a previously developed and tested prototype for computer science education in a middle school oceanography elective, the ENGAGE project's objective is to design and study a more comprehensive curricular strategy for middle school life science using a game-based learning environment that will deeply integrate computational thinking practices within the life science curriculum. Topics will include the study of interdependent relationships of species in ecosystems, matter and energy in organisms and ecosystems, and natural selection of species and their adaptations for survival. Along with a focus on student learning, the project will develop and study a teacher professional development model to support teachers in the integration of computational thinking in middle school life science. Principal Investigators will gather specific evidence about the ways in which game-based learning can effectively support computationally rich science practices aligned with the new Science Education Framework (National Research Council, 2012) and the Computer Science Teachers' Association, Computer Science Education Computational Thinking Framework (2016). Specifically, the effort will: (1) design an innovative curricular strategy and novel game-based learning environment to develop computationally rich science practices (developing and using models, and analyzing and interpreting data), for middle school students from North Carolina and Florida; (2) investigate how middle school students develop computational thinking practices (creating abstractions and models, analyzing problems and artifacts, and developing computational artifacts) in middle school science classrooms with the game-based learning environment; and (3) develop an evidence-based teacher professional development program that supports teachers in the deep integration of computational thinking into middle grades science. <br/><br/>The overarching research question will be: How can deep, mastery-oriented gameplay develop core computational thinking practices in middle school life science? Related sub-questions will include: (a) How can game-based learning promote the development of students' science and engineering practices?; (b) How can game-based learning promote student mastery of computational thinking deeply infused science education?; and (c) How can game-based learning for computationally rich science improve students' attitudes in science with regard to short-term self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and long-term STEM career interest? The project will undertake three types of activities carried out in parallel across each year of the project. First, it will develop and iteratively refine the curricular strategy and collaborative game-based learning environment, which will be implemented at partner middle schools in North Carolina and Florida, with increasing numbers of teachers and students participating in each succeeding year. Second, the study will develop, implement, and refine the corresponding professional development materials and associated online and face-to-face activities. The teacher professional development will be implemented throughout the school year, utilizing both a summer institute and ongoing school-based support. Third, classroom studies will be conducted to build the evidence base on how middle school students can most effectively develop computationally rich science practices. For the classroom studies, the project will compare three conditions: (1) the baseline condition (standard science classroom practice with no project implementation) will utilize teachers who have not previously participated in the project; (2) the project-without-game condition, where students will participate in an implementation of the curricular strategy that provides out-of-game computational problem solving on data-rich science problems outside of the game, but does not provide the game-based learning experiences; and (3) implementation of a full version of the ENGAGE curricular strategy that provides both game-based learning experiences, as well as outside-of-game computational problem solving. Data-gathering strategies throughout the three-year duration of the study will include: classroom observations, individual teacher interviews, student and teacher focus groups, project-developed assessments, embedded game-based learning assessments, student-created artifact assessments, pre- and posttest assessments, and assessments of science and STEM attitudes. Data interpretation strategies will include: comparative analysis of scores across years and across the three experimental conditions, observational and formative analyses to guide refinement of learning tasks, qualitative and quantitative analyses of student performance and growth, and formative analysis of changes in self-reported attitudes. The main outcome of the project will be a research-informed and field-tested prototype integrating computational thinking into science learning at the middle school level. An external organization will conduct the formative and summative evaluations."

It is also essential that the infrastructure, the very means by which technologies are developed for improving the public's engagement in science itself, be better understood. Thus, this AISL Innovations in Development project will address the critical need for the public to learn how to interpret and understand highly complex and visualized scientific data. The project will design, develop and study a new technology platform, xMacroscope, as a learning tool that will allow visitors at the Science Museum of Minnesota and the Center of Science and Industry, to create, view, understand, and interact with different data sets using diverse visualization types. The xMacroscope will support rapid research prototyping of public experiences at selected exhibits, such as collecting data on a runner's speed and height and the visualized representation of such data. The xMacroscope will provide research opportunities for exhibit designers, education researchers, and learning scientists to study diverse audiences at science centers in order to understand how learning about data through the xMacroscope tool may inform definitions of data literacy. The research will advance the state of the art in visualization technology, which will have broad implications for teaching and learning of scientific data in both informal and formal learning environments. The project will lead to better understanding by science centers on how to present data to the public more effectively through visualizations that are based upon massive amounts of data. Technology results and research findings will be disseminated broadly through professional publications and presentations at science, education, and technology conferences. The project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The project is driven by the assumption that in the digital information age, being able to create and interpret data visualizations is an important literacy for the public. The research will seek to define, measure, and advance data visualization literacy. The project will engage the public in using the xMacrocope at the Science Museum of Minnesota and at the Center of Science and Industry's (COSI) science museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio. In both museum settings the public will interact with different datasets and diverse types of visualizations. Using the xMacroscope platform, personal attributes and capabilities will be measured and personalized data visualizations will be constructed. Existing theories of learning (constructivist and constructionist) will be extended to capture the learning and use of data visualization literacy. In addition, the project team will conduct a meta-review related to different types of literacy and will produce a definition with performance measures to assess data visualization literacy - currently broadly defined in the project as the ability to read, understand, and create data visualizations. The research has potential for significant impact in the field of science and technology education and education research on visual learning. It will further our understanding of the nature of data visualization literacy learning and define opportunities for visualizing data in ways that are both personally and culturally meaningful. The project expects to advance the understanding of the role of personalization in the learning process using iterative design-based research methodologies to advance both theory and practice in informal learning settings. An iterative design process will be applied for addressing the research questions by correlating visualizations to individual actions and contributions, exploring meaning-making studies of visualization construction, and testing the xMacroscope under various conditions of crowdedness and busyness in a museum context. The evaluation plan is based upon a logic model and the evaluation will iteratively inform the direction, process, and productivity of the project."

GRIDS will investigate strategies to improve middle school students' science learning by focusing on student ability to interpret and use graphs. In middle school math, students typically graph only linear functions and rarely encounter features used in science, such as units, scientific notation, non-integer values, noise, cycles, and exponentials. Science teachers rarely teach about the graph features needed in science, so students are left to learn science without recourse to what is inarguably a key tool in learning and doing science. GRIDS will undertake a comprehensive program to address the need for improved graph comprehension. The project will create, study, and disseminate technology-based assessments, technologies that aid graph interpretation, instructional designs, professional development, and learning materials. <br/><br/>GRIDS will start by developing the GRIDS Graphing Inventory (GGI), an online, research-based measure of graphing skills that are relevant to middle school science. The project will address gaps revealed by the GGI by designing instructional activities that feature powerful digital technologies including automated guidance based on analysis of student generated graphs and student writing about graphs. These materials will be tested in classroom comparison studies using the GGI to assess both annual and longitudinal progress.  Approximately 30 teachers selected from 10 public middle schools will participate in the project, along with approximately 4,000 students in their classrooms.  A series of design studies will be conducted to create and test ten units of study and associated assessments, and a minimum of 30 comparison studies will be conducted to optimize instructional strategies. The comparison studies will include a minimum of 5 experiments per term, each with 6 teachers and their 600-800 students.  The project will develop supports for teachers to guide students to use graphs and science knowledge to deepen understanding, and to develop agency and identity as science learners."

Schools are expected to prepare a new and more diverse group of leaders for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) industries, yet teachers with math and science training are increasingly valuable in the private sector. Teacher shortages, primarily in the fields of math and science, often require school leaders to fill positions with under-qualified teachers. Research is limited on this problem because there is limited longitudinal data linking teachers to individual students or linking teacher labor markets to non-teacher labor markets. As a result, state and district policymakers often lack necessary evidence on how to reform teacher labor market policies in ways that both reduce regional and subject-specific shortages and improve students' access to highly-qualified educators. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will develop interdisciplinary research expertise in this area by drawing on large scale longitudinal student-level datasets. The project's overarching goals are to develop and link databases for next-generation data-intensive research in education and to build an interdisciplinary community of scholars at UTEP that will continue to analyze these datasets in future research.<br/><br/>The research project will explore three stages of the math and science teacher pipeline: (a) entrance of teacher candidates through preparation programs or alternative certification; (b) assignment of currently employed teachers to classrooms, and their later transfers to other schools and districts; and (c) exit out of the teaching labor market and into non-teaching educational positions or private sector employment. These analyses are facilitated by data on private sector employees in Texas that can be linked to multiple longitudinal student- and teacher-level datasets covering 250,000 teachers and over five million students each year for more than a 20-year period. The research topics that form the basis of this study are: (a) teacher supply, shortages, and the teacher preparation pipeline; (b) access to effective teachers for historically underserved students; and (c) factors leading to teacher attrition.

Recent advances in multimodal learning analytics are creating novel opportunities for expanding the range and richness of measures of visitor engagement in free-choice settings. In particular, multimodal learning analytics offer significant potential for integrating multiple data sources to devise a composite picture of visitors' cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement. The project will center on providing a rich empirical account of meaningful visitor engagement with interactive tabletop science exhibits among individual visitors and small groups, as well as uncovering broader tidal patterns in visitor engagement that unfold across exhibit spaces. A key objective of the project is creating models and practitioner-focused learning analytic tools that will inform the best practices of exhibit designers and museum educators.

These limited opportunities are often the result of systemic practices in schools that impact a wide range of connected parts of the school including leadership, access to CS/CT resources for students and teachers, CS/CT learning opportunities for students and teachers, and prior experiences and encouragement to participate in CS/CT.  This project will build on a long-standing Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) between NC State University's Friday Institute for Educational Innovation and a middle school in Wake County Public School System to deepen the RPP to further develop conceptual, theoretical, and applied frameworks for CS/CT. Additionally, the project will scale this RPP work to another newly-forming CS/CT focused magnet through a developing partnership with UNC Charlotte and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to replicate the RPP for a new ""Computer science and coding"" magnet program. Since mathematics and science classes are taken by all middle school students, the project will use this academic context as the focus of the project's work. This proposal specifically targets middle schools in both Charlotte and Raleigh with relatively high African-American and Latinx populations, and free and reduced lunch percentages, to scale the existing RPP. The project goals are to provide equitable access to underrepresented students in computing; to prepare middle school students for computing curriculum in high school; to develop and test effective CS/CT modules that integrate in existing math and science curriculum; to investigate CS/CT-focused systemic barriers and supports; and to propagate RPP findings to other schools and districts.<br/><br/>The STEM ecosystems framework is an emerging model for framing the barriers and support structures students have in STEM learning, including CS/CT that recognizes that effective CS/CT learning is the product of the entire connected academic enterprise--with elements including school leadership, teacher and student CS/CT resources, and available CS/CT learning opportunities, along with prior experiences, encouragement, and training in CS/CT. The project will adapt the STEM ecosystem model as a scalable, generalizable approach for systematic, school-wide integration of CS/CT into required math and science courses. Within the context of two magnet middle schools seeking to integrate CS/CT across their curricula, this work will be guided by the following overarching research questions: 1. What are the barriers to developing a STEM ecosystem that supports CS/CT for every student through integration into middle school science and math courses? 2. What factors or interventions are needed to support the development of a CS/CT focused STEM ecosystem that supports everyone in a school? 3. What are the indicators of success for a CS/CT focused STEM ecosystem in a school? 4. How does the ecosystem prepare and engage all students, especially those from underrepresented student groups, for CS/CT work in high school? To address the first two research questions, data will include meeting notes for thematic analyses from RPP leadership teams, interviews with teachers and school leaders, observational and self-report survey data from teachers and school leadership. Additionally, professional development workshop data will be included to triangulate responses from interviews and surveys. To address the third research question, data will include student demographic data, participation in STEM activities, classroom observations, student engagement as measured by demographics exposed to CS/CT within and external to the curriculum, activity observations of engagement levels, self-report data of attitudes, learning and future interest in CS/CT, teacher observations of learning and engagement, activity/module ratings from students, teachers, observers, class artifacts (portfolios or projects), and End of Grades science and math performance.

This project is a Design and Development collaborative effort between the University of Colorado at Boulder and Utah State University aimed at investigating the impact of the SparkFun Smart School platform, a school-based sensing platform, combined with a targeted teacher professional development on teachers' ability to support CT integration and promote student interest and learning. The project will examine the affordances of this sensing platform--an example of a new genre of robust, consumer-grade sensing technologies emerging as part of the Internet of Things. Raw data will be collected through a series of wireless sensor nodes measuring sound, light, motion, temperature, pressure, and humidity; a network-enabled hub; a web-based data logging resource for real-time data collection; and programmable motors and effectors for creating interactive displays of phenomena of interest by using materials that produce light, sound, and movement. This expanded environment for doing science enables teachers across STEM disciplines to creatively integrate computational thinking activities into their disciplinary instruction. By selecting personally or locally relevant scientific phenomenon, deploying sensors to collect data streams, and conducting data analyses, students will learn tangible computing processes, collaboratively build interactive displays, and deepen their STEM knowledge. Teachers will form a professional learning community, gain essential content and pedagogical content knowledge, plan and implement lessons that integrate science and computer science practices, and reflect on their instruction and students' learning. The project will develop and study a professional development process, the CT Integration Cycle, based on the Problem-Solving Cycle, a research-based approach developed and studied to support teachers in adapting their lessons and classroom instruction to strengthen student-centered strategies. This professional development model is an ongoing, highly collaborative process, whereby teachers plan, enact, and analyze their instruction using video records of classroom implementation.<br/><br/>The collaborative effort will follow three high-level theoretically principled conjectures that will guide the research and development process: (1) Learning experiences that utilize the sensing platform to investigate phenomena relevant to students' lives will engage diverse learners in CT; (2) Learning experiences that deeply integrate CT practices and science and engineering practices will support students to develop robust CT skills, competencies, and dispositions as well as deepen their understanding of STEM subjects; and (3) An adapted version of the Problem-Solving Cycle can support teachers to productively integrate CT into their STEM instructional planning and classroom implementation. The four sets of research questions of the project are: (1) In what ways, and for which student populations, do the SchoolWide Labs learning experiences deepen interest and engagement in CT?; (2) Which learning experiences are most effective at deepening students' disciplinary science knowledge?; (3) To what degree and in what ways do teachers' planned and enacted sensor-based lessons change over time? Are there differences across teachers and science content areas?; and (4) What professional learning processes and tools support teachers to productively integrate CT using a sensing platform into their disciplinary STEM instruction? The pursued research and development activity will study the full trajectory of teachers' CT integration processes, from lesson planning to lesson enactment. Consistent with the principles of Design-Based Implementation Research, the project will aim to understand implementation variation across disciplines of STEM, with the intention of developing understanding of how best to make the innovation work across a range of carefully sampled contexts. Denver Public Schools will recruit 12 middle school science and integrated STEM teachers (life, Earth, and physical science), organized into 3-4 school-based teams, reaching 2,400 diverse and predominantly low-socioeconomic status middle school learners over the project performance period. Data will be collected from students (surveys, interviews, clickstreams, assessments, and project artifacts); classroom lessons (written plans and videotaped observations); teachers (interviews); and professional development workshops. For analysis of student learning and also for teacher change over time, the project will employ appropriate multilevel models, including two-level hierarchical linear modeling due to the nested nature of the data. A power analysis (using a power level of .80 and an alpha-level of .05) was conducted to determine how many students are needed to detect an educationally meaningful effect of the program (minimum detectable effect size of approximately 0.20). The results of the power analyses showed the study is adequately powered to detect this minimum effect on student-level outcomes. Utah State University will lead the evaluation component of this effort, including formative, iterative, and summative perspectives. It will center on both processes and products. The evaluation questions are: (1) To what extent is the Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) producing research results to foster educational improvement?; How effective are the implementation strategies in terms of addressing a concrete educational need?; (2) To what extent are Design-Based Implementation Research processes involving key participants?; What are impacts of the design processes on beliefs and practices of participants?; Are all participants in the RPP assuming their defined roles effectively?; (3) What are the consequences, intended or not, resulting from the dynamics of the partnership?; (4) Are products being iteratively refined by taking into account feedback from all participants?; and (5) To what extent are the project's products disseminated in ways that help practitioners? The project will generate two toolkits as products to support teacher professional development and classroom instruction. The research will advance theory and knowledge on productive integration processes by studying the types of support STEM teachers need to effectively integrate CT into learning activities that: (a) support equitable engagement of diverse students; and (b) use CT as a vehicle to deepen their students' science knowledge. Further, it will build on and extend research-based principles of three dimensional science learning described in the recently published science education framework (NRC, 2012) as a strategy for productive integration, and contribute to theoretical literature on pedagogical design capacity, curriculum adaptation, and teacher professional learning."

Student assessment has become a nationwide educational priority due, in part, to the need for relevant and timely data that inform teachers, administrators, researchers, and the public about how all students perform and think while learning science. This project responds to the need for technology-enhanced assessments that promote the critical practice of scientific argumentation--making and explaining a claim from evidence about a scientific question and critically evaluating sources of uncertainty in the claim. It will investigate how to enhance this practice through automated scoring and immediate feedback in the context of two high school curriculum units--climate change and fresh-water availability--in schools with diverse student populations. The project will apply advanced automated scoring tools to students' written scientific arguments, provide individual students with customized feedback, and teachers with class-level information to assist them with improving scientific argumentation. The key outcome of this effort will be a technology-supported assessment model of how to advance the understanding of argumentation, and the use of multi-level feedback as a component of effective teaching and learning. The project will strengthen the program's current set of funded activities on assessment, focusing these efforts on students' argumentation as a complex science practice.<br/><br/>This design and development research targets high school students (n=1,940) and teachers (n=22) in up to 10 states over four years. The research questions are: (1) To what extent can automated scoring tools, such as c-rater and c-rater-ML, diagnose students' explanations and uncertainty articulations as compared to human diagnosis?; (2) How should feedback be designed and delivered to help students improve scientific argumentation?; (3) How do teachers use and interact with class-level automated scores and feedback to support students' scientific argumentation with real-data and models?; and (4) How do students perceive their overall experience with the automated scores and immediate feedback when learning core ideas in climate change and fresh-water availability topics through scientific argumentation enhanced with modeling? In Years 1 and 2, plans are to conduct feasibility studies to build automated scoring models and design feedback for previously tested assessments for the two curriculum units. In Year 3, the project will implement design studies in order to identify effective feedback through random assignment. In Year 4, a pilot study will investigate if effective feedback should be offered with or without scores. The project will employ a mixed-methods approach. Data-gathering strategies will include classroom observations; screencast and log data of teachers' and students' interaction with automated feedback; teachers' and students' surveys with selected- and open-ended questions; and in-depth interviews with teachers and students. All constructed-response explanations and uncertainty items will be scored using automated scoring engines with fine-grained rubrics. Data analysis strategies will include multiple criteria to evaluate the quality of automated scores; descriptive statistical abalyses; analysis of variance to investigate differences in outcomes from the designed studies' pre/posttests and embedded assessments; analysis of covariance to investigate student learning trajectories; two-level hierarchical linear modeling to study the clustering of students within a class; and analysis of screencasts and log data."

The hypotheses suggest that deficits in certain early skills underlie a significant proportion of racial/SES math and science gaps, and the large proportion (about one-half) of U.S. students with significant skill gaps underlies a significant part of mediocre international math/science scores. This work builds on prior NSF-supported research. Goals of the proposed research are to: (1) expand longitudinal data sets used to identify and characterize the developmental skills linked to later math/science, (2) strengthen the statistical methodology used to link early developmental skills to later achievement and incorporate analysis at the math/science subscale level, (3) introduce a new statistical methodology - latent profile analysis - to cluster children using their multiple skill distributions into groups with similar profiles and utilize growth models to predict their achievement trajectories as skills change, (4) formalize and shorten the process involved in the design, development and experimental testing of interventions, (5) develop strategies for combining interventions and using multiple interventions for a cohort of children from preschool to early grades that would eliminate achievement gaps, and (6) formulate a comprehensive national strategy and priorities for addressing the skill deficits linked to math/science achievement gaps."

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new multidisciplinary approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning, and discipline-specific efforts in computing designed to build an evidence base for teaching and learning of computer science in K-12, including within diverse populations. This project will develop, implement, and study an innovative multi-week middle school curriculum unit in computational weather forecasting that integrates students' learning and use of meteorology, mathematics, and computational thinking concepts and practices. Led by investigators at Concord Consortium, the project team includes weather scientists, computer scientists, education developers, and learning scientists from Argonne National Laboratory, Millersville University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The curriculum consists of instructional materials and technologies that transform classrooms into dynamic weather simulations and then scaffold students' learning and use of science, mathematics, and computational thinking as they (a) collect and analyze data from the simulated weather events; (b) develop and refine computational models from these data; (c) and use computational models to make and evaluate weather predictions. Live webcasts with meteorologists enable students to learn about how they made predictions from same data sets students examined. Approximately 430 students will be involved with and benefit from the project. The diverse nature of the participating schools will both engage a demographically diverse student population in STEM and help the project achieve significant broader impacts, by assuring that the findings and curriculum developed reflect the needs of a broad diversity of people and places. <br/><br/>This project will address a daunting challenge to developing STEM literacy in students: integrating teaching and learning of key ideas and practices of science and mathematics with computational thinking in authentic, innovative and effective ways. The project will exploit young people's universal interest in weather and the computationally intensive practice of modern meteorology to develop an inquiry-based curriculum in which students play the role of scientific experts that apply computational thinking as they explore, explain, and predict weather phenomena. The curriculum consists of a) four standards-aligned instructional sequences; b) a suite of technologies, software systems, and weather data sets; and c) professional development workshops and materials to support teachers' curriculum implementation. The intervention will address specific needs of middle school students and teachers with regard to relevant disciplinary content, practices, and computation as specified in Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core State Standards for mathematics, and recent consensus frameworks for computational thinking in STEM. Over three years the project will engage eight teachers and their 430 students who will work with the project team members to test the curriculum in distinctive middle school settings in Illinois, Massachusetts, and Alaska. The mixed methods design-based research will use a rich set of student tests, reflections, narrated computer models (called screencasts), and video recordings of students during classroom activities as sources of evidence. The research seeks to understand how students use computational thinking practices to generate explanations and predictions of weather events, and how these explanations and predictions evolve with the sequence and complexity of computational thinking practices. The research further seeks to understand how a set of core design elements of the curriculum facilitate students' computational thinking and reasoning about weather events. The research and external evaluation will explore replicability and scale by elucidating how findings and design elements generalize to unique populations, such as Alaskan Inuit students, and the contexts in which they learn. The project will produce an evidence-based trajectory of learning that describes how students become more sophisticated in their understanding of weather science and in their scientific explanations and predictions of weather events in conjunction with their use of key computational practices of collecting, interpreting, and representing data; evaluating and predicting with computational models. The project will also produce a set of evidence-based design principles for broader dissemination. The research findings will be shared with Concord Consortium's extensive network of more than 25,000 teachers, researchers, and policymakers, and by more traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. The curriculum will be licensed via open source and open content licenses and freely distributed to other teachers, curriculum designers, and researchers through Concord Consortium's website."

These limited opportunities are often the result of systemic practices in schools that impact a wide range of connected parts of the school including leadership, access to CS/CT resources for students and teachers, CS/CT learning opportunities for students and teachers, and prior experiences and encouragement to participate in CS/CT.  This project will build on a long-standing Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) between NC State University's Friday Institute for Educational Innovation and a middle school in Wake County Public School System to deepen the RPP to further develop conceptual, theoretical, and applied frameworks for CS/CT. Additionally, the project will scale this RPP work to another newly-forming CS/CT focused magnet through a developing partnership with UNC Charlotte and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to replicate the RPP for a new ""Computer science and coding"" magnet program. Since mathematics and science classes are taken by all middle school students, the project will use this academic context as the focus of the project's work. This proposal specifically targets middle schools in both Charlotte and Raleigh with relatively high African-American and Latinx populations, and free and reduced lunch percentages, to scale the existing RPP. The project goals are to provide equitable access to underrepresented students in computing; to prepare middle school students for computing curriculum in high school; to develop and test effective CS/CT modules that integrate in existing math and science curriculum; to investigate CS/CT-focused systemic barriers and supports; and to propagate RPP findings to other schools and districts.<br/><br/>The STEM ecosystems framework is an emerging model for framing the barriers and support structures students have in STEM learning, including CS/CT that recognizes that effective CS/CT learning is the product of the entire connected academic enterprise--with elements including school leadership, teacher and student CS/CT resources, and available CS/CT learning opportunities, along with prior experiences, encouragement, and training in CS/CT. The project will adapt the STEM ecosystem model as a scalable, generalizable approach for systematic, school-wide integration of CS/CT into required math and science courses. Within the context of two magnet middle schools seeking to integrate CS/CT across their curricula, this work will be guided by the following overarching research questions: 1. What are the barriers to developing a STEM ecosystem that supports CS/CT for every student through integration into middle school science and math courses? 2. What factors or interventions are needed to support the development of a CS/CT focused STEM ecosystem that supports everyone in a school? 3. What are the indicators of success for a CS/CT focused STEM ecosystem in a school? 4. How does the ecosystem prepare and engage all students, especially those from underrepresented student groups, for CS/CT work in high school? To address the first two research questions, data will include meeting notes for thematic analyses from RPP leadership teams, interviews with teachers and school leaders, observational and self-report survey data from teachers and school leadership. Additionally, professional development workshop data will be included to triangulate responses from interviews and surveys. To address the third research question, data will include student demographic data, participation in STEM activities, classroom observations, student engagement as measured by demographics exposed to CS/CT within and external to the curriculum, activity observations of engagement levels, self-report data of attitudes, learning and future interest in CS/CT, teacher observations of learning and engagement, activity/module ratings from students, teachers, observers, class artifacts (portfolios or projects), and End of Grades science and math performance. For Question 4, members of the project and RPP teams, with input from the Advisory Board will perform an annual review of NC high school CS course syllabi against emerging K12 CS standards. Lesson plans and artifacts of student work from Reedy Creek and Northside will be sampled and compared against current high school expectations for CS academic work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This study will investigate factors influencing the persistence of teacher change after professional development (PD) experiences, and will examine the extent to which modest supports for science teaching in grades K-5 sustain PD outcomes over the long term.  Fifty K-12 teachers who completed one of four PD programs situated in small, rural school districts will be recruited for the study, and they will participate in summer refresher sessions for two days, cluster meetings at local schools twice during the academic year, and optional Webinar sessions two times per year.  Electronic supports for participants will include a dedicated email address, a project Facebook page, a biweekly newsletter, and access to archived Webinars on a range of topics related to teaching elementary school science.  Modest support for replacement of consumable supplies needed for hands-on classroom activities will also be provided.  The project will examine the extent to which these modest supports individually and collectively foster the sustainability of PD outcomes in terms of the instructional time devoted to science, teacher self-efficacy in science, and teacher use of inquiry-based instructional strategies.   The effects of contextual factors on sustainability of PD outcomes will also be examined.<br/><br/>This longitudinal study will seek answers to three research questions: 1) To what extent do modest supports foster the sustainability of professional development outcomes in: a) instructional time in science; b) teachers' self-efficacy in science; and c) teachers' use of inquiry-based instructional strategies?  2) Which supports are: a) the most critical for sustainability of outcomes; and b) the most cost-effective; and 3) What contextual factors support or impede the sustainability of professional development outcomes?  The project will employ a mixed-methods research design to examine the effects of PD in science among elementary schoolteachers over a 10 to 12 year period that includes a 3-year PD program, a 4-6 year span after the initial PD program, and a 3-year intervention of modest supports.  Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from multiple sources, including: a general survey of participating teachers regarding their beliefs about science, their instructional practices, and their instructional time in science; a teacher self-efficacy measure; intervention feedback surveys; electronic data sources associated with Webinars; teacher interviews; school administrator interviews; and receipts for purchases of classroom supplies.  Quantitative data from the teacher survey and self-efficacy measure will be analyzed using hierarchical modeling to examine growth rates after the original PD and the change in growth after the provision of modest supports.  Data gathered from other sources will be tracked, coded, and analyzed for each teacher, and linked to the survey and self-efficacy data for analysis by individual teacher, by grade level, by school, by district, and by original PD experience.  Together, these data will enable the project team to address the project's research questions, with particular emphasis on determining the extent to which teachers make use of the various supports offered, and identifying the most cost-effective and critical supports."

Without this understanding, effective science instruction called for by the Next Generation Science Standards may rarely occur, and we will not be able to meet the challenge of improving STEM education for all students. Our objective for this research is to document and define a range of beginning elementary teacher practices for noticing and responding to students? scientific sense-making and the contextual factors that impact their practice over a range of several years to determine how these practices develop over time. Contextual factors include aspects such as curriculum materials, professional community, prior experiences, and professional vision. Knowing more about how and why teachers learn to notice and respond to students? science sense-making can enable more effective design of educational programs, instructional supports, and tools helping teachers ensure that all of their students have opportunities to learn meaningful science.<br/><br/>Researchers from Michigan State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison will use longitudinal comparative case-study methodology to analyze and describe how beginning elementary teachers notice and respond to students? scientific sense-making in multiple science topic areas across several years in urban school settings. Data will be collected from 32 beginning 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary science teachers and six expert teachers across the upper Midwest (e.g., Chicago, IL, Lansing, MI, and Madison, WI). Data includes two teacher-generated sense-making portfolios a year containing: classroom video of science teaching, teacher analysis of student work, and teacher interviews about noticing and responding. Data analysis will be based on 4 dimensions of teacher performance and reflection: the nature and type of opportunities for student sense-making, noticing, interpreting/reasoning, and responding to students? scientific sense-making. We will use a constant comparative approach to analyze data ? examining and sorting case study data against aspects of teaching contexts and personal resources to look for patterns over time. Advisory board members will evaluate this project with respect to research design, tools, and outcomes. <br/> <br/>The final products of our study will include (1) empirically-based descriptions of 32 beginning teacher practices across several years and six expert teachers to illustrate different types of teacher noticing and responding as well as different pathways, trajectories, and approaches of beginning teacher noticing and responding (2) a set of tested and revised data collection measures and analytical tools for documenting and describing teacher noticing, and (3) a model of beginning teacher noticing that can explain how noticing and responding to students? sense-making is mediated by personal resources and professional contexts. This research will positively affect participating teachers and their students, as well as the larger teacher education research community by transforming theories of elementary science teacher education and beginning teacher practice. The research will contribute knowledge about the influences of contexts on teacher practice and outline potential pathways for teacher development. Research products promise to contribute to the development of a highly qualified science teachers using high-leverage practices in diverse urban contexts."

EHR seeks proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The ECR program is distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers will develop a statistical analysis technique for measuring how people learn. With prior NSF funding, members of the team created epistemic network analysis (ENA), a technique for creating network models of complex and collaborative thinking in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. ENA is being used by more than 40 researchers at 19 universities to answer a wide range of research questions in learning sciences, cognitive neuroscience, engineering education, environmental science education, medical and surgical education, and history of science. The proposed research and development will create an online toolkit that lets researchers upload audio, video, text, or log-file data, automatically transcribe the audio data, develop and validate automated codes using supervised natural language processing tools, and produce ENA models. This will make it possible for researchers analyze data on how people learn without requiring simultaneous expertise in automated transcription, data segmentation, coding, and network modeling. It will also make it possible to conduct analyses of learning using the large volumes of data that are currently generated by online learning tools, significantly expanding capacity for research on learning.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team will conduct fundamental research on learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by developing and extending a theory-based statistical analysis technique for using network analysis to model complex and collaborative STEM thinking (CCST). With prior NSF funding, members of the team created epistemic network analysis (ENA), a technique for creating dynamic models of CCST. Data on CCST typically come in one of two forms: Video and audio recordings of interactions from classrooms and workplaces, or log files from online interactions. Data in audio or video form must be transcribed. Text data from recordings or log files have to be coded, or annotated to indicate what elements of CCST are present in the data, and where those elements are located. With existing tools, researchers must complete these steps by hand, or use their own techniques for automated transcription and coding. However, many skilled CCST researchers are not simultaneously experts in the sciences of automated transcription, automated identification, validation, and application of codes, and network analysis. The proposed research and development will create ENAlysis, an online toolkit that provides a seamless, automated analysis pipeline from raw data to final results. The project will thus develop innovative methods for measuring STEM learning and expand access to a proven, theory-based technique for analyzing CCST. The result will be expanded use of powerful learning analytic techniques to model CCST, which will significantly improve assessment of STEM thinking and learning and inform policy and practice."

The proposed project broadens the utility of Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) approaches, which include citizen science, to support new angles in informal learning. It also extends previous work on interactive data visualizations in museums to encompass an element of active contribution to scientific data.  To achieve these goals, this project will develop and research U!Scientist (pronounced `You, Scientist!')--a novel approach to using citizen science and learning research-based technology to engage museum visitors in learning about the process of science, shaping attitudes towards science, and science identity development. Through the U!Scientist multi-touch tabletop exhibit, visitors will: (1) interact with scientific data, (2) provide interpretations of data for direct use by scientists, (3) make statements based on evidence, and (4) visualize how their data classifications contribute to globe-spanning research projects. Visitors will also get to experience the process of science, gaining efficacy and confidence through these carefully designed interactions. This project brings together Zooniverse, experts in interactive design and learning based on large data visualizations in museums, and leaders in visitor experience and learning in science museums. Over fifty thousand museum visitors are expected to interact annually with U!Scientist through this effort. This impact will be multiplied by packaging the open-source platform so that others can easily instantiate U!Scientist at their institution. <br/><br/>The U!Scientist exhibit development process will follow rapid iterations of design, implementation, and revision driven by evaluation of experiences with museum visitors. It will involve close collaboration between specialists in computer science, human-computer interaction and educational design, informal science learning experts, and museum practitioners. The summative evaluation will be based on shadowing observations, U!Scientist and Zooniverse.org logfiles (i.e., automated collection of user behavior metrics), and surveys. Three key questions will be addressed through this effort: Q1) Will visitors participate in PPSR activities (via the U!Scientist touch table exhibit) on the museum floor, despite all the distractions and other learning opportunities competing for their attention? If so, who engages, for how long, and in what group configurations? Q2) If visitors do participate, will they re-engage with the content after the museum visit (i.e., continue on to Zooniverse.org)? Q3) Does engaging in PPSR via the touch table exhibit--with or without continued engagement in Zooniverse.org after the museum visit--lead to learning gains, improved understanding of the nature of science, improved attitudes towards science, and/or science identity development?"

The three-year exploratory project, Maker Partnership: A Research Practice Partnership to Integrate Computer Science and Computational Thinking into Science Instruction, is designed to build knowledge about how to help teachers successfully integrate computer science (CS) and computational thinking into elementary grade science classes through maker pedagogy and curriculum. Maker pedagogy emphasizes learning through student-centered inquiry, creating, and innovating. It is based on the principles and practices of the engineering design process, which is an iterative cycle that consists of defining a problem, researching, planning, prototyping and testing solutions, and refining the solution as necessary. The project will generate important lessons about how to train and prepare elementary grade teachers to incorporate CS and CT into their science teaching, particularly in the context of high-poverty schools that serve large numbers of Black and Latino youth. <br/><br/>Through a research-practice partnership, the Research Alliance for New York City Schools, Schools That Can, and MakerState will collaborate to iteratively design, implement and test the Maker Partnership curriculum and professional development (PD). The research will address the following research questions: (1) To what degree was the Maker Partnership implemented with fidelity to the program model? What were the facilitators and barriers to implementation? (2) To what degree did participating teachers integrate CS and CT into their in-school science instruction? What inhibited and facilitated that integration? (3) What were the outcomes for teachers participating in the Maker Partnership, in terms of their CS and CT content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, instructional practice, and dispositions? How did the Maker Partnership curriculum, professional development, and support change teachers' approach to instruction? (4) What were the outcomes for students in participating classrooms, particularly students historically underrepresented in science? How did the maker curriculum and pedagogy influence student engagement, interest and deeper learning of the content? (5) How was the model adapted by teachers and schools to meet their specific context and needs? What are the local context factors that should be considered when expanding the Maker Partnership model to new sites? In the first year of implementation, teachers will participate in a PD and support and then implement the Maker Partnership curriculum in an afterschool setting. Throughout the year, the research team will collect and analyze data on the PD and implementation to inform improvements to the model, with a particular focus on transitioning the curriculum and pedagogical approach from the afterschool setting to the in-school classroom setting. In the second year, the team will work with the same teachers and administrators to implement the model in their science classrooms. They will continue to collect and use data to iterate and refine the curriculum and PD and support and assess outcomes for teachers and students. Data collected throughout the study will include teacher surveys, student pre-post surveys, CS/CT and science skill and content mastery assessments, CT and science standardized tests, school record data, interviews, and observations."

Studying the processes underlying these naturally occurring events and the relationships between humans and their environments would enrich the standard Earth science curriculum by providing students with valuable insights about the potential impacts of extreme natural events. This project will respond to that need by developing and testing a new instructional approach that integrates a data analysis tool with Earth systems models in a suite of online curriculum modules for middle and high school Earth science students. Each module will be designed as a sequence of activities lasting approximately 7-10 class periods. These will be stand-alone modules so each teacher can implement just one module or several modules. The modules will facilitate development of rich conceptual understandings related to the system science of natural hazards and their impacts.  Students will develop scientific arguments that include risk assessment based on their understanding of real-world data and the particular Earth system being studied. The project will develop a set of computational models designed specifically to explore geoscience systems responsible for natural hazards. An open-source data analysis tool will also be modified for students to create and analyze visualizations of the magnitude, frequency, and distribution of real-world hazards and the impact of those hazards on people. Students will compare data generated from the Earth systems models with real-world data in order to develop an understanding of the cause and progression of natural hazards, as well as to make predictions and evaluate future risks. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>The four-year, early stage design and development project will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, design-based research will be used to iteratively design and test Earth systems models. A team of five lead teachers will field test modules and provide focus group feedback during the development phase of the curricula. These lead teachers will provide input into the design and development of the tools, the organization and structure of the curriculum, and provide suggestions about classroom implementation to support the development of teacher support materials. After the models are developed, four curriculum modules related to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires will be developed, tested, and revised. In Phase 2, a group of 30 teachers will participate in implementation studies that will test usability of the modules across students from diverse backgrounds and feasibility of implementation across a range of classroom settings.  Research will focus on understanding how to support student analysis of real-world datasets in order to improve their conceptual understanding of complex Earth systems associated with natural hazards.  The project will also examine the role of uncertainty when students make scientific arguments that include predictions about the behaviors of complex systems and the uncertainties related to risk assessment.  The project aims to clarify student views of uncertainty and how teachers can better support student understanding of the inherently uncertain nature of systems, models, and natural hazards, while understanding that models can be used to reduce impact.  Questions guiding project research include: (1) How do students use flexible data visualizations to make sense of data and build and refine conceptual models about natural hazards?  (2) How do students incorporate data from models and the real world in formulating scientific arguments; how do students use scientific uncertainty to assess risks based on their understanding of a natural hazard system; and how do students quantify and explain risks to humans and compare different sources of risks? And (3) Do GeoHazard curriculum modules help students make gains in risk-infused scientific argumentation practice and conceptual understanding underlying natural hazards? To what extent, for whom, and under what conditions is the GeoHazard curriculum useful in developing risk-infused scientific argumentation practice and conceptual understanding?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. Over the past two decades, social science research has found that girls and women encounter barriers in STEM education and then face additional obstacles entering and advancing in STEM careers. Yet, the effects of motherhood and fatherhood on the careers of STEM professionals are not well studied. This research will explore whether parenting--especially motherhood--incurs penalties in STEM employment in terms of retention, advancement, and salary. Using a sociological theoretical perspective that socially structured life courses move through gendered institutions, the study will examine how parenthood shapes career trajectories, retention, and salaries for women and men in STEM fields. The proposed empirical research project will use representative, longitudinal data to analyze these parenthood effects among STEM professionals. The researchers will also investigate how these parenthood effects differ by race/ethnicity, education level, sector, and STEM field. The findings will inform theory about gender differences in retention across all career stages and efforts to develop interventions that improve women's long-term persistence and success in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will use nationally representative, longitudinal, restricted-use data of STEM professionals from the Nation Center for Science and Engineering's (NCSES) Science and Engineering Statistical Data System (SESTAT) to examine the effects of parenthood on career paths and pay. The sample (N=17,599) includes STEM professionals employed full-time in 2003 and followed through 2010. Through a series of bi- and multivariate statistical analyses, the researchers will address the following research questions: Who leaves full-time STEM employment after becoming a parent? Where do they go? How do these parenthood effects vary by gender, race/ethnicity, education level, sector, and STEM field? Is the cost in lost income of making a career change higher if respondents made the change for family reasons compared to other reasons? Among workers who remain in full-time STEM careers, how do gender, parenthood, education level, and race/ethnicity affect salary? Since a large majority of workers become parents at some point during their careers, understanding the gendered effects of parenthood on the careers of STEM practitioners is central to understanding the retention of talented women and men in these fields. The researchers will also look for systematic variation by race/ethnicity, education level, sector and STEM field."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  The Exploratorium in San Francisco, in collaboration with social science researchers at Arizona State University and Rutgers University, will conduct a two-year Pilots and Feasibility Studies project that will test a new model for integrating museum exhibits with public participation in scientific research, called Exhibit-Based PPSR (E-PPSR).  The team will create a mini-exhibition about social psychology that (a) engages science museum visitors in investigating and reflecting on social factors that promote cooperation or not, (b) builds public awareness of the science of social psychology and (c) generates valid data for academic research in this area. <br/><br/>The Exploratorium will build on its long history of creating participatory exhibits that engage visiting groups in social science learning and in self-reflective metacognition. This expands beyond the typical lab-in-the-museum in which individual visitors interact with researchers' laptops or simple props. The model takes the exhibit experiences further, injecting the dimension of public participation in social psychology research. By voluntarily and anonymously contributing demographic and response data, large numbers of people from mixed-age groups will help social scientists gain new insights into cooperation among a broader sample of humanity than are usually studied in university labs.  The E-PPSR lab is always available, rather than open only when a researcher is present.  The model also incorporates research on learning and assesses the effect of E-PPSR on social science learning experiences. Do museum visitors build greater conceptual understanding of the social science by contributing to real research and seeing their own responses within the larger dataset? Do they attend more deeply to debriefing activities when they have contributed their own data? The three main deliverables include: 1) a prototype Exhibit-based PPSR laboratory at the Exploratorium comprised of one exhibit for gaining informed consent, three 'Data-Catcher' exhibits modified to record anonymous responses when visitors opt-in to contributing to social psychological research, and one debriefing exhibit. A back-end database will send data to the academic researchers; 2) evaluation studies that test the E-PPSR model. The studies will assess the success of debriefing approaches, the effectiveness of recruitment and the impact of E-PPSR on learning. The team will publish a journal article describing the E-PPSR model and academic research findings.

The project will collaboratively design, test and study effective and efficient ways to develop embedded assessments (EAs) of citizen science (CS) volunteer scientific inquiry skills in order to better understand the impact of these CS experiences on volunteer scientific inquiry abilities. EAs are assessment activities that are integrated into the learning experience and allow learners to demonstrate their competencies in an unobtrusive way. The acquisition of scientific inquiry skills is an essential, even defining, characteristic of citizen science experiences that has a direct influence on data quality. Methods for assessing the direct impact of CS on volunteers' scientific inquiry skills are limited. The project will result in EA measures designed for use by diverse CS projects, strategies that CS projects can use to develop EA assessment tools, and research findings that document opportunities, supports and barriers of this innovative method across a range of CS contexts. Findings and initial resources will be shared with the broad array of stakeholders in CS through conferences, workshops, peer-reviewed publication, community websites and other relevant venues. The results of this work also have the potential to generalize to other informal science learning experiences that engage the public in science<br/><br/>The project will address two research questions: (1) What processes are useful for developing broadly applicable EA methods or measures? and (2) What can we learn about gains in volunteers' scientific inquiry skills when citizen science organizations use EA? These will be addressed through design-based research focused on two streamlining strategies. For the reframing data validation strategy, six leaders from five established citizen science projects will conduct secondary analyses of their existing databases to uncover the skill gains of CS volunteers that are currently unexplored in their data. For the common measure strategy, ten CS projects will collaborate to create and test common EA measures of select identification-based skills. Data will be gathered through meeting notes, participant interviews and action plans, and volunteer skill gains to capture process and products of each strategy. Data will be analyzed using grounded theory, multiple process techniques, multilevel models, and repeated-measures analysis of variance. The design-based-research framework will significantly expand project impacts by jump-starting evaluation of the participating CS projects and by producing initial resources for two distinct EA strategies that have the potential to dramatically alter practice and impact citizen science efforts to ultimately enable more people to learn by contributing to the science endeavor. The project will directly equip the 15 participating citizen-science projects with authentic performance tools to assess the quality of their programing, which will expand their understanding of CS volunteer skills and help them better recruit and support their varied audiences (including rural, low-income and tribal communities)."

While computing has dramatically transformed science research and practice, it remains a separate and distinct area of study in almost all pre-college education contexts. The objective of this STEM+C project is to increase students' skill in Computational Thinking - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CT-STEM) practices and explore how computational representations support significant shifts in the ways students learn and practice science. Findings will include fine-grained characterizations of the competencies students bring to their development of computational thinking practices, in particular competencies for developing algorithms, data mining and visualization, and designing/building agent-based models (models with multiple software simulated agents that interact). These findings will enrich the field's understanding of the nature and development of CT-STEM practices. This is an important contribution given that investigating CT-STEM practices is still in early stages.<br/><br/>In this project, the researchers will integrate agent-based modeling software (NetLogo Web) with a block-based form of the software (NetTango) and create seamless interoperation with data analysis, systems dynamics modeling and visualization tools. One benefit of tools like these is that they enable students who do not have experiences with text-based programming to engage in previously inaccessible computational practices. The research team will partner with teachers from three Chicago-area high schools to add Computational Thinking components to existing science curricula by integrating these additional tools and practices. The project will pursue the following five objectives: (1) fully integrate NetLogo and NetTango, create seamless interoperation with data analysis, visualization and systems dynamics modeling tools, and offer the integrated software through the web-based platform; (2) build units that cover more of the high school science curriculum and incorporate practices for developing algorithms, data mining, visualization, and designing/building computational models; (3) develop assessments that evaluate students on these practices; (4) test units and assessments in classrooms by collecting student response data through the web-based platform; and (5) investigate students' engagement in computational thinking practices and characterize the competencies that they bring to their learning and how their practices develop over time. Further, the researchers' online delivery platform will be scalable to facilitate participation from other high schools, potentially engaging many thousands more students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute to that effort by developing new curriculum units for high school biology courses that integrate computational thinking within biology. The units will feature inquiry-oriented investigations that will require students to design procedures using a variety of computer-controlled sensors, actuators, video-capture devices, and other technologies to solve open-ended problems. Students will use a simplified visual programming language, called Dataflow, to automate experimental procedures, collect and visualize data, and wirelessly link to data sharing devices. To use these real-time resources effectively, students will need to link the causal (cause and effect) thinking of the natural sciences to the computational thinking skills of computer science. The project will develop 12 curriculum units comprising 6 background units, 3 highly structured set-piece experiments, and 3 open-ended projects. Sets of two background units, 1 set-piece experiment, and one open-ended project will allow students to progress through development of foundational knowledge and experimental skills before taking on the challenge of an open-ended project.  The outcomes of this project have high potential to advance classroom practices in science by identifying ways of using computers and computational thinking to engage students more deeply in the processes and reasoning of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>The project will conduct design-based research, using the first two project years to develop and validate a pedagogical model of integration between science and computational thinking practices and related activities. In year three, the project will undertake a pilot implementation to test the feasibility of the project's innovations in the biology classes taught by 26 teachers in diverse schools. The project will provide teachers with teaching resources, technology, and professional development designed to enable their students to undertake two science investigations requiring a total of four to six weeks of classes. A mixed-methods research strategy will be employed both to characterize and estimate student gains in applying computational thinking, carrying out science practices, and understanding core biology content knowledge related to ecosystems. Data will be gathered from classroom observations, pretests and posttests, embedded assessments in activities, student screencast reports, interviews with teachers and students, and log data automatically collected by learning software. This variety of data sources will be triangulated to validate research findings from multiple perspectives. Three questions guide the research: A) To what extent and under what conditions are students able to use the project's computational resources to undertake authentic scientific investigations? B) When students are engaged in science experimentation made possible by the resources, approach, and designed tools, what learning gains will be observed in student abilities to perform science practices, exercise computational thinking, and understand biology concepts? What factors are associated with differences in the gains, if any? and C) What kinds of background materials and assistance do teachers require for effective enactments of the intended curriculum? Specifically, how important is teacher background and experience with computers to support student use of technology-enabled experimentation? What was the impact of various kinds of teacher supports on the quality of the classroom enactments."

The project addresses the urgent national priority to improve science education as envisioned in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by focusing less on learning facts and equations and instead providing students with the time, skills, and resources to experience the conduct of science and what it means to be a scientist. This project builds on prior work that created a sequence of physics activities that significantly improved students' abilities to undertake data-based experiments and led to productive independent investigations. The goal of the InquirySpace project is to improve this physics sequence, extend the approach to biology and chemistry, and adapt the materials to the needs of diverse students by integrating tailored formative feedback in real time. The result will be student and teacher materials that any school can use to allow students to experience the excitement and essence of scientific investigations as an integral part of science instruction. The project plans to create and iteratively revise learning materials and technologies, and will be tested in 48 diverse classroom settings. The educational impact of the project's approach will be compared with that of business-as-usual approaches used by teachers to investigate to what extent it empowers students to undertake self-directed experiments. To facilitate the widest possible use of the project, a complete set of materials, software, teacher professional development resources, and curriculum design documents will be available online at the project website, an online teacher professional development course, and teacher community sites. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>InquirySpace will incorporate several innovative technological and pedagogical features that will enable students to undertake scientific experimentation that closely mirrors current science research. These features will include (1) educational games to teach data analysis and interpretation skills needed in the approach, (2) reduced dependence on reading and writing through the use of screencast instructions and reports, (3) increased reliance on graphical analysis that can make equations unnecessary, and (4) extensive use of formative feedback generated from student logs. The project uses an overarching framework called Parameter Space Reasoning (PSR) to scaffold students through a type of experimentation applicable to a very large class of experiments. PSR involves an integrated set of science practices related to a question that can be answered with a series of data collection runs for different values of independent variables. Data can be collected from sensors attached to the computer, analysis of videos, scientific databases, or computational models. A variety of visual analytic tools will be provided to reveal patterns in the graphs. Research will be conducted in three phases: design and development of technology-enhanced learning materials through design-based research, estimation of educational impact using a quasi-experimental design, and feasibility testing across diverse classroom settings. The project will use two analytical algorithms to diagnose students' learning of data analysis and interpretation practices so that teachers and students can modify their actions based on formative feedback in real time. These algorithms use computationally optimized calculations to model the growth of student thinking and investigation patterns and provide actionable information to teachers and students almost instantly. Because formative feedback can improve instruction in any field, this is a major development that has wide potential."

In addition, online technologies such as live chatting and forums have opened new possibilities for people to collaborate from locations around the world.  The innovation that the projects provide is bringing these opportunities together, enabling real-time research and discussion as participants observe and annotate live streaming footage; sharing questions and insights through live Q&A sessions; and explore data with interactive visualization tools. Scientists will support the community's research interests, in contrast with traditional models of citizen science in which communities support the work of scientists. This project will enable people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives to co-create scientific investigations, including participants who might not otherwise have access to nature. The evaluation research for this project will advance the understanding of practices that enable interconnected communities of people to participate in more phases of scientific discovery, and how participation affects their learning outcomes. It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)  learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. As such, this project will advance a new genre of Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR). It will also advance scientific exploration using live wildlife cams and establish a database for long-term research to understand how bird behavior and reproductive success are affected by environmental change. <br/><br/>This project aims to deepen public involvement in science, building on knowledge and relevance for STEM learning by creating an online learning environment that expands on traditional crowdsourcing models of PPSR in which participants collect data to answer questions driven by scientists. In this project, participants are involved in co-created research investigations, including asking questions, deciding what data are needed, generating data, looking for patterns, making interpretations, reviewing results, and sharing findings. The goals are to 1) create a system that involves the public more deeply in scientific research; 2) develop participants' science skills and interests; 3) increase participants? understanding of birds and the environment; 4) generate new scientific knowledge about wildlife; and 5) advance the understanding of effective project design for co-created PPSR projects at a national scale. Through iterative design and evaluation, the project will advance the understanding of the conditions that foster online collaboration and establish design principles for supporting science and discovery in online learning environments. Through scaling and quasi-experimental studies, the evaluation research will advance the understanding of how learning outcomes may be similar or different for participants engaging in different ways, whether they observe the cams and read about the investigation, process data as contributors, provide some input as collaborators, or join in most or all of the scientific process as co-creators.  <br/><br/>Despite the popularity of live wildlife cams, with millions of people watching hundreds of cams around the world, little research has been conducted on the use of live cams for collaborative work in formal or informal science education. The infrastructure and open-source framework created for this project will expand the capacity for online communities of people from diverse career backgrounds and perspectives to collaborative on solving personally meaningful questions and contribute to new knowledge. Using this project as a prototype, cam operators from around the world could build networks of cams, enabling future studies with broader scope for comparative biological studies and discoveries. Additionally, it will serve as a model for use in classrooms or for online communities exploring other scientific fields using live-streaming content in collaborative research. By involving scientists and participants from across society as collaborators and co-creators, this project can help increase public engagement with science, technology, and environmental stewardship while advancing the understanding of the natural world and informing public decision-making."

These programs have been shown to have a wide range of impacts on scientific literacy, school achievement, and career interest. Because such programs take place outside of home and school, they offer participants learning flexibility and a sense of agency that otherwise do not exist in traditional science learning contexts.  However, current research on OST is largely limited to evaluation-level data that has not been synthesized, making it difficult to draw definite conclusions.  As seen in other fields, a larger evidence base is needed for the OST field to grow or else non-evidence-based policies will be imposed upon the field by outside forces. The project team will conduct an experimental, longitudinal research project to address these issues.  This Research-in-Service to Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>The study uses a sophisticated design with a wide variety of measures to follow three cohorts of adolescent youth (~200) over a 4-year period to address the primary research question:  How does participation of adolescent youth from traditionally underrepresented groups in a well-established, out-of-school time science program affect their career choices and attitudes towards science as they mature into early adulthood?  While each measure is rooted in established literature and methodology, putting it all together using a comprehensive, complementary approach has not yet been done in the OST field. The research studies will be looking at a number of variables in order to measure program impact including: demographic and experiential background of program participants, STEM attitudes, career interest/choices, scientific engagement, and participation. Data will be collected via survey, observation, interviews, and document review.  The program practitioners will contribute diary and field note data to the study.<br/><br/>This project will provide STEM education practitioners with the evidence-based information they need to develop better programs for underrepresented minority (URM) youth so program and policy decisions are not made in a vacuum. Operationally, findings will have an impact on OST and URM science education researchers by generating new research methodology and techniques. Tactically, it will benefit greater URM communities by investigating how OST programs can support science learning and scientific interest among their adolescent youth. Strategically, the study impacts the nation by providing evidence about the validity of OST programs as a critical partner to address the issue of URM involvement in the STEM workforce. Also, the corpus of raw data will be made public, providing a large and varied data set for others to explore.

Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) presents a possible method to increase flow of scientific and local knowledge, enhance STEM-based problem solving skills, and co-create new knowledge about phenology at local and regional or larger scales. However, there remain some key challenges that the field of PPSR research must address to achieve this goal. The proposed research will make substantial contributions to two of these issues by: 1) advancing theory on the interactions between PPSR and resilience in social-ecological systems, and 2) advancing our understanding of strategies to increase the engagement of youth and adults historically underrepresented in STEM, including Alaska Native and indigenous youth and their families who play an essential role in the sustainability of environmental monitoring in the high latitudes and rural locations throughout the globe. In particular, our project results will assist practitioners in choosing and investing in design elements of  PPSR projects to better navigate the trade-offs between large-scale scientific outcomes and local cultural relevance. The data collected across the citizen science network will also advance scientific knowledge on the effects of phenological changes on berry availability to people and other animals. <br/><br/>The Arctic Harvest research goals are to 1) critically examine the relationship between PPSR learning outcomes in informal science environments and attributes of social-ecological resilience and 2) assess the impact of two program design elements (level of support and interaction with mentors and scientists, and an innovative story-based delivery method) on the engagement of underserved audiences. In partnership with afterschool clubs in urban and rural Alaska, we will assess the impact of participation in Winterberry, a new PPSR project that investigates the effect of changes in the timing of the seasons on subsistence berry resources. We propose to investigate individual and community-level learning outcomes expected to influence the ability for communities to adapt to climate change impacts, including attributes of engagement, higher-order thinking skills, and their influence on the level of civic action and interest in berry resource stewardship by the youth groups. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we compare these outcomes with the same citizen science program delivered through two alternate methods: 1) a highly supported delivery method with increased in-person interaction with program mentors and scientists, and 2) an innovative method that weaves in storytelling based on elder experiences, youth observations, and citizen science data at all stages of the program learning cycle.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The project will address a real-world issue, sleep insufficiency, and its health consequences, as an innovative means to foster interests and engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among elementary school students. Partnering with the Catalina Foothills School District, researchers at the University of Arizona will develop, implement, and evaluate a new STEM education program that includes: a) a novel set of sleep science lessons developed in collaboration with Biological Sciences Curriculum Study; b) project-based learning experiences; and c) out-of-school exposure to STEM professionals and opportunities for students to present findings from their own investigations. The project will also develop a teacher professional development component tailored to the new program, and a strategy for increasing parental involvement in the learning process.  Portable devices will enable students to track sleep patterns in their own natural environments, and all data will be routed to a new, online platform, MySleep, which will provide real-time feedback, options for communications with teachers and parents, and data analysis capabilities. Through partnerships with businesses and organizations, a set of supplemental resources will be developed for parents and caregivers, including webinars and interactive presentations. Study of all these project components will provide data about strategies caregivers and teachers can adopt to promote among young students greater understanding of STEM fields, improved proficiency in STEM skills, and greater interest in pursuing STEM education pathways and careers.<br/><br/>This is a three-year design and development study that will employ a quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent control group in years two and three to examine student and parent outcomes from field tests of  newly developed sleep study lessons.  Following the initial year of curriculum development, participants in the first cohort of field trials during year 2 will include approximately 220 students across four 4th grade classrooms and four 5th grade classrooms in one elementary school.   Another set of 4th and 5th grade classrooms in a school having similar demographics in the same school district will serve as a comparison group.  Following curriculum revisions based on findings of the initial field test during year 2, refined sleep study lessons will be implemented in the classrooms of approximately 440 students in the 4th and 5th grades across the same two schools in year 3.  Outcomes to be measured include student interests in STEM areas and careers, student proficiency in selected STEM-related skills, and level of parental engagement with their students' STEM learning.  Six features of the new set of lessons are hypothesized to increase engagement and motivation of 4th and 5th grade students in STEM-related experiences: (1) content (sleep) that is relevant to everyone's lives (students, teachers, and parents) and essential for healthy day-to-day functioning; (2) inquiry-based sleep science lessons using an evidence-based instructional model; (3) use of interactive educational software and various technologies (personalized) that allow students to actively engage by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting their own data; (4) a teacher professional development paradigm using face-to-face, online, and educative curriculum materials; (5) parental involvement/engagement strategies using a well-developed model of family-school involvement; and (6) out-of-school learning experiences including exposure and interactions with STEM professionals from diverse backgrounds.  The outcomes of this project will likely have broad impacts on both classroom practices with young learners and our understanding of how to engage young students in personally relevant studies that inspire them to consider STEM-related careers and the education pathways that lead to those careers.  The development of curriculum materials in both English and Spanish will assist teachers in engaging underrepresented and underserved populations in activities of high interest and personal relevance that demonstrate the importance of STEM learning to our society."

This issue is particularly important as states begin to adopt CS standards for K-12 with little to no support for implementation of the standards. At the same time, students with the most common disabilities need to have opportunities to learn the content and practices outlined those CS standards. The project will address this problem by generating, working in partnership with a local school division, Norfolk City Public Schools, a usable, comprehensive, effective, and appealing model of professional development (PD) to support CS integration in elementary instruction for all learners, with an emphasis on supporting students with high-incidence disabilities. In developing PD for integration of CS standards in elementary grades and creating resources to support teachers in this integration, this project will work with more than 75 elementary teachers in the partner district. Of the nearly 10,000 current K-5th grade students in NCPS in any given year, these teachers will, conservatively, teach 1,500 students or 15% of the student population yearly. The PD model will also be extended into other school divisions in Virginia through its relationship with CodeVA. Finally, PD and research-partnership strategies will be disseminated through online resources (i.e., video library, online training modules), presentations at local and national conferences, and peer reviewed manuscripts.<br/><br/>Faculty from George Mason University and Old Dominion University created a Researcher Practitioner Partnership with personnel from Norfolk City Public Schools (NCPS) that will use a Design Based Implementation Research (DBIR) process to refine an effective PD model to support elementary teachers in inclusive classrooms in integrating recently-mandated CS standards into math, science, and literacy instruction in ways accessible to students with high-incidence disabilities (e.g. learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral disorders, mild intellectual disability, high functioning autism, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). Theoretically and conceptually, the research will contribute to pedagogical strategies and approaches for integrating computer science and understanding how elementary teachers understand CS standards and approach CS integration. The Universal Design for Learning instructional framework will guide the implementation team and partner educators to design instruction to meet the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities, by addressing barriers to learning. The research will examine CS sequencing through grade-appropriate progressions by drawing on the expert insights of elementary classroom teachers. The project will also develop disciplinary literacy through CS as students use various strategies to read, write, and communicate their understanding within and among various disciplines. Combined, these efforts will help answer the overarching question: How do multiple stakeholders collaboratively refine and develop effective and sustainable PD on the integration of computer science in K-5 inclusive classrooms to support students with high incidence disabilities? The project will collect data via interviews with teachers, field notes from observations, teacher assessment & survey results, verbal protocol data, teacher lesson plans, video data, and student work samples across 6-week iterative cycles as part of the DBIR process. Analysis of interviews, observations, lesson plans, and verbal protocol think-alouds in each cycle will rely on the constant-comparative qualitative method. Analysis of data from pre-post measures will include descriptive statistics and paired-sample t-test to measure the growth of teachers through the PD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will investigate student engagement in science in the interest of of broadening participation in STEM fields. This will be an important undertaking since research shows that low student engagement is a major challenge for students from subpopulations often underrepresented in STEM fields. The research will help advance knowledge in STEM areas where empirical studies of student engagement have lagged behind theoretical work in this area. Few studies have measured student engagement holistically as a multifaceted construct for broadening participation in science. This study will advance knowledge in STEM education by identifying instructional contexts that foster optimal student engagement and by examining whether adolescent students' engagement profiles in science vary systematically by gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and the intersection of these factors. It will serve the national interest by investigating the extent to which engagement profiles are consistent across and related to features of the science learning context, achievement and persistence-related outcomes; and if these relationships differ by gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and the intersection of these factors. The study will also examine how science educators respond to the identified profiles and to variations observed, and will use this knowledge in designing materials to disseminate findings to practitioners. <br/><br/>This project will use a person-oriented analytic approach to examine individual differences and contextual variation in students' engagement in different science learning environments, and to link engagement patterns to students' achievement and persistence in STEM fields. Rich multi-method data sets will be used to develop profiles of student engagement involving adolescents' cognitive, affective, and behavioral states during the science learning process. These data will be instrumental in focusing, guiding, and communicating research efforts to practice. In addition to the knowledge generated and disseminated through traditional academic outlets, the project will develop two tangible products. The first product will be a free and publicly available statistical software library, or package, of tools and functions needed to conduct person-oriented analysis in R, the open-source programming language and software. These tools will be available for researchers, scholars, and developers. The second product will be a user-friendly guide that will inform science educators about engagement profiles and practices that engage students, including those from underrepresented groups in science, in the most meaningful ways. The guide to student engagement will help educators identify and respond to student engagement around science content, and to design lesson plans that may support greater engagement. The guide will be used for purposes of professional development and teacher preparation, impacting STEM scholars and educators, and training graduate students and post-doctoral fellow as they take part in research activities."

The goal of this project is to develop resources and a professional development model to help early-elementary teachers improve science instruction among young learners by cultivating scientific discourse.  A central component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is engaging students in discourse with a focus on formulating and communicating scientific explanations.  This project will develop a classroom observation tool that will help teachers examine changes in the quantity and quality of science discourse in K-2 classrooms over time.  The project will also develop an online professional development (PD) model that uses the new observation tool to help teachers analyze their own classroom practices and the practice of others to improve classroom efforts to foster improved scientific discourse. <br/><br/> This early stage design and development study will employ a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach to develop the new classroom observation tool and online professional development model, and then seek answers to the following research questions: 1) How can a classroom observation measure be developed to effectively capture the range in quality of science discourse in early elementary classrooms?;  2) How can an online PD model be developed based on the new observation tool?; 3) How do teachers' knowledge and instructional practice change over the course of participation in the yearlong PD?; and 4) How does the quantity and quality of science discourse change in K-2 classrooms over the course of teachers' participation in a yearlong online PD experience that is built around the new observation tool?  The project will engage 36 teachers and their 36 different classrooms in Michigan and use multiple data sources to understand whether and how teacher knowledge and instructional practices change during participation in the new PD model.  Multiple iterations of design, data collection, and refinement will be used to understand how, when, and why features of the PD and observation tool might combine to transform science discourse in early elementary classrooms.  In years 3 and 4, the project team will conduct two year-long implementation trials with cohorts of 15 teachers and 5 instructional coaches (experienced science teachers) who will use the PD and tool in order study their implementation and make iterative improvements.

College and career-ready standards also call for attention to supporting students' learning of how to think and communicate like disciplinary experts.  The teaching practice of orchestrating classroom discussion is intended to support students in obtaining higher levels of academic achievement but also to support students' participation in a democratic society. However, research has found that teachers--particularly novice teachers--struggle to orchestrate discussion effectively for science and mathematics. The investigators of this project hypothesize that opportunities to 1) practice orchestrating discussions in simulated classroom environments; 2) receive constructive feedback on their practice; and 3) reflect on that feedback and their experiences with peers and teacher educators, develops preservice teachers' abilities to lead productive classroom discussion. This may allow them to be more effective at orchestrating discussion when they begin teaching real students in science and mathematics classrooms. The project team, which includes investigators from Educational Testing Service (ETS) and software engineers at Mursion, will develop, pilot, and validate eight discussion-oriented performance tasks that will be embedded in an online simulated classroom environment. The resulting research and development products could be used nationwide in teacher preparation and professional development settings to assess and develop teachers' ability to support classroom discussion in science and mathematics.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools.

This Early Stage Design and Development project will 1) iteratively develop, pilot, and refine eight science and mathematics discussion-oriented performance tasks (six formative, two summative), scoring rubrics, and rater training materials; 2) deploy the intervention in four university sites, collecting data from 240 prospective teachers in both treatment and business-as-usual courses; and 3) use data analyses and expert review to build a five-part argument for the validity of the assessment and scoring rubrics. Data sources include prospective teachers' background and demographic information, cognitive interviews, surveys, scores on content knowledge for teaching (CKT) instruments, performance and scores on the developed performance tasks, discussion scores on Danielson's Framework for Teaching observation protocol, and case study interviews with prospective teachers. The project team will also conduct interviews with teacher educators and observe classroom debrief sessions with prospective teachers and their teacher educators. The research will examine each teacher's scores on two summative performance tasks administered pre- and post-intervention and will look for evidence of growth across three formative tasks. Linear regression models will be used to understand relationships among teachers' CKT scores, pre-intervention performance task scores, group assignment, and post-intervention performance task scores. A grounded theory approach to coding qualitative data of 24 case study teachers, observations of debrief sessions, and interviews with teacher educators will generate descriptive use cases, illustrating how the tools can support prospective teachers in learning how to facilitate discussions focused on science and mathematics argumentation. Mursion will develop a webpage on its website dedicated to this project that will allow the team to post the new performance-based tasks, scoring rubrics, and examples of performance in the simulated environment for teacher educators, educational researchers, and policy makers and collect feedback from them that can be used as another information source for refining tools and their use.  Research findings will also be disseminated by more traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed research and practitioner journals and conference presentations."

The new instructional sequences will integrate computer science and science learning experiences through simulated internships for core middle school science classrooms, and are designed to increase student dispositions toward, and capacity for, computer programming and computational thinking. Ultimately, the intervention is designed to support broader participation in computer science (CS) fields of study and careers, with particular emphasis on females. This project seeks to accomplish this goal by: (1) immersing up to 4000 11-14 year old youth (Grades 6-8) students in simulated internships that mirror the collaborative and computational work of practicing scientists, and that can be embedded within a school's core science curriculum; (2) offering a more inclusive model of computer science work that can expand students' perception of the nature and value of computer programming and encourage a broader range of students, and females in particular, to identify as possible programmers; (3) gathering evidence that can advance and deepen the field's understanding of how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences; and 4) identifying specific factors, designs, and practices likely to engage students in CS, improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations, and that are likely to improve the capacity of teachers and districts to support CS education. The project extends prior work aimed at incorporating coding and computational thinking into the school in the following ways: an explicit focus on collaborative discourse and collaborative problem solving, including that within digitally-mediated discussion forums; backend data logging of student interactions within the simulated internships' digital environments in order to analyze how student understanding develops at the intersection of science and computer science; just-in-time teacher learning via an educative curriculum to support system capacity and broader impact; and a research and development model that explicitly incorporates school, district, and state policy level stakeholders in the design process, in order to build an understanding of how the intervention, and those like it, can be successfully and sustainably implemented. The project is also supported by the STEM+Computing program (STEM+C) to advance research on how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences and improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations.<br/><br/>The mixed-methods research agenda for this project will be guided by four questions: 1) What specific design features and instructional strategies of the CS Internships are most important for broadening student participation in CS?; 2) What aspects of the CS Internships are most important to support sustainability of CS and science integration?; 3) What factors, design features, and practices are most important for supporting productive student engagement in, and teacher facilitation of, collaboration and discourse (both in-person and digital) in STEM?; and 4) What aspects of student understanding may be revealed when students are able to manipulate the code behind scientific models? In Year 1, the project will pilot and iteratively develop the first of two Coding Science Internships, with methodology grounded in design-based implementation research. Research activities will include observations of piloted lessons and teacher interviews. Also in Year 1, the project will also begin to examine how students develop computational thinking and computer programming practices, through cognitive interviews with students in pilot classrooms. In Year 2, the project will begin broad implementation and systematic investigation of the internship developed in Year 1, and begin iteratively developing the second internship, which will be broadly implemented in Year 3. Research activities related to broad implementation in Years 2 & 3 will include pre-post measures for students (including scales measuring disposition toward CS, and CS and science practices), and teachers (including scales measuring science and technological pedagogical content knowledge and competency beliefs for CS instruction); daily engagement surveys for students; and daily intervention feasibility and perceived value surveys for teachers. In addition to analyses of variance and covariance, the project will employ mediation analysis to examine interactions among key variables contributing to any observed learning gains. Years 2 & 3 will also feature extensive capture of student data generated through interactions with the digital resources (e.g, ""clickstream"" and metadata, submission data and discourse within the digital discussion forums). Learning analytics methods (including machine learning, Bayesian network modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation) applied to these massive data sets will be aimed at providing more subtle insight into student development of computational thinking as it applies to science, and possible learning trajectories for the integrated development of computer science and science practices."

Elementary school teachers have a great impact on student motivation to pursue STEM fields of study and careers and are being increasingly asked to emphasize key STEM content, including  computer science in their teaching. However, few of these teachers have the academic background to achieve these expectations. This three-year STEM+C project will develop a practice that elementary school teachers can use to integrate the teaching of coding with the standard practices already used to teach mathematics, science and other curriculum content. The project also will develop a model course that prepares teachers to educate students in interdisciplinary, holistic ways to learn mathematics, science, and coding and equips them to guide students through reasoning processes while learning to code. Outcomes will inform the fields of computer science, mathematics, and science education about an argumentation-based approach that integrates the teaching of STEM, a core objective of the STEM+C program. <br/><br/>This project aims to increase attention to computer science coding in elementary classrooms and the probability that elementary students develop interests in coding and other STEM-focused areas of study. To do so, the project will create (a) a learning approach in which novice programmers (i.e., elementary teachers and students) use arguments to develop a coding sequence using structured reasoning instead of trial-and-error, (b) help teachers build content knowledge of programming and extend their knowledge of appropriate mathematics and science pedagogy into the teaching of coding through argumentation, and (c) emphasize the argumentation approach as an integrator for the teaching and learning of coding, mathematics, and science. Activities associated with this project will enhance teachers' understanding of argumentation and then investigate how the teachers implement the CALC approach in grades 3 to 5. Participating teachers will enroll in a graduate-level course that teaches them how to use the CALC approach for coding. Once the teachers complete the course, they will implement the CALC approach in their classroom, helping their students to learn how to code. The research team will coach the teachers in their lesson enactments and will assess the effectiveness of the CALC concept as an age-appropriate method to teach and learn computer science content. Assessment data include capturing teacher actions via video recordings that will be analyzed in an ongoing process, interviews of teachers and assessment of student work."

The project seeks to investigate the necessary conditions to expand learning opportunities and outcomes from a previous project with sixth graders in new learning environments with diverse ethnic groups, rural areas, alternative schools, and different climate zones. The scale-up plan (Dede, 2006) addresses depth (deep belief change), sustainability (maintaining the innovation over time), spread (diffusion of the innovation to a large number of classrooms), shift in reform ownership (comes to be owned and maintained by the local school), and evolution (project revision by a reflective community of practice over time). To accomplish its goals, the University of North Texas partners with Numedeon Inc. to provide curriculum development services through Whyville, a learning-based virtual environment about the science and mathematics of energy. <br/><br/>The key research question is: What are the necessary conditions to scale-up the positive impacts of STEM content knowledge, dispositions, and affinity for careers from a previous project to a wider audience of diverse populations and learning environments representative of the national student population? The setting of the project is 24 middle schools in seven states (Maine, Vermont, Virginia, North Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, and Hawaii). The G-Power, version 3.1, is used to estimate power of the proposed analyses using individual repeated measures ANOVA analyses. Assuming the projected sample size of 1,400, with =0.05 and ES=0.05, power is estimated at 0.84. In Year 1, teachers (n=8) and students (n=192) will be the treatment group, while 8 new classrooms with the same sample sizes will be the comparison groups. In Year 2, teachers (n=16) and students (n=384) will be the treatment group, and 8 classrooms will be the comparison groups. In Years 3 and 4, treatment groups will consist of teachers (n=24) and students (n=576), and comparison groups will include teachers (n=16) and students (n=384). The impact of the project is analyzed at the student and classroom levels using a quasi-experimental design. To reduce the risk of confounding variable due to individual differences, each student from the comparison group will be matched with a corresponding student from the treatment group using propensity score matching techniques. The project performs a logistic regression analysis to produce a propensity score for each subject using a weighted combination of covariates chosen for the theoretical influence that they could have on the systematic differences between the treatment and control groups. Treatment and comparison classrooms are also matched so that subsequent analyses may be performed at the classroom level. Because sample sizes are small, the project use covariates, including school location, school-level SES, percentages of students by gender, and average science achievement to match closely equivalent classrooms in the treatment and comparison groups. Data gathering using valid and reliable instrumentation includes (a) the STEM Semantics Survey, a 25-item semantic differential instrument containing five scales assessing perceptions of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics; (b) a Likert-type Career Interest Questionnaire of 12 items on three scales; (c) a second Likert-type instrument from the TIMSS 2007 Mathematics Study (IEA, 2007); (d) the National Geographic Vampire Power Quiz to assess STEM content gain; and (e) the Career Aspirations Survey to detect changes due to project activities (Nolte & Harris, 2010). Data are analyzed at the matched-student and classroom levels using within-subjects analyses. Differences between measures collected before and after participation in the project activities are analyzed to determine the level of impact that the project has on participants. Data interpretation strategies include quantitative data analysis techniques, such as repeated measures analysis of variance for comparing gains by treatment students to gains by comparison students. Also employed are Hierarchical Linear Modeling to separate out the differential effects of the intervention at differing school sites, as well as multivariate techniques, such as General Linear Modeling for comparisons of the time series (three-point) growth lines of treatment students to the same time-series points for trend lines of the comparison groups. Qualitative data gathering strategies from interviews and surveys data by site, date, and project objective are used to explain the why-type of questions emerging from quantitative data analyses. <br/><br/>Project outcomes are: (a) a research-informed and field-tested prototype focused on energy conservation for middle school students; (b) data on the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by middle school students to become stewards of Planet Earth; (c) relevant instructional materials; and (d) a set of valid and reliable instruments."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is significant because it uses the community for learning science of the environment, in an approach called Citizen Science or Participatory Science Research (PSR). The project will target learning outcomes for underrepresented middle and high school students in the urban and diverse East San Francisco Bay Area. The fundamental issues that will be studied deal with particulate matter (PM) in the local area. The project will generate information that contributes to better understanding the impact of a science curriculum with PSR activities on science learning. The project will provide opportunities for students at a total of 10 different middle and high school sites to engage in a broad range of activities where the students will collect, analyze, and disseminate data generated in local urban communities. An accompanying curriculum that includes new and previously tested skills development activities also will be produced and used to aid students in connecting PSR activities to inter-related topics such as: energy generation and use, global climate, environmental degradation, and community health (asthma, in particular). <br/><br/>The project will refine a theory of learning that makes more explicit the connections between science practices, identity, and value and relevance. The project will yield information useful in the future development of effective learning environments in urban areas, providing positive science education experiences to challenge students' previous notions and ways of relating to science. The students will learn how to identify with science by gaining a deeper understanding of science practices. They will learn how to analyze and interpret data; construct explanations; engage in argument from evidence; and obtain, evaluate and communicate information. The students will be collecting air samples which will be analyzed using an electron microscope. In conducting their research, students will use low cost, highly accurate AirBeam particle monitors and tablet devices to measure and georeference PM concentration levels as they travel within their schools and surrounding communities. These measurements will then be used to assess ventilation conditions within school buildings, and correlated with different transit routes and transportation systems in an attempt to assess exposure patterns associated with different modes of transit in a given area. The result will be an increase in the understanding of the relevance and the value of science in everyday life. The project will also yield high quality particulate matter data that will be useful for local environmental efforts as well as to public health and atmospheric scientists."

This project will address the need to educate teachers and students to engage in asking questions, collecting and interpreting data, making claims, and constructing explanations about real-world problems that matter to them. Science educators generally agree that science classrooms should provide opportunities for students to advance their thinking by engaging in critical conversations with each other as capable sense-makers. Despite decades of reform efforts and the use of experiential activities in science instruction, research indicates that classroom learning for students remains largely procedural, undemanding, and disconnected from the development of substantive scientific ideas. Furthermore, access to high-quality science instruction that promotes such complex thinking is scarce for students with diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The project goals will be: (1) To design a year-long teacher professional development program; and (2) To study the extent to which the professional development model improves teachers' capacity to plan and implement inclusive science curricula. <br/><br/>This study will explore ways to enhance youths' learning experiences in secondary school classrooms (grades 6-12) by building a sustainable partnership between researchers and practitioners. The work will build on a previous similar activity with one local high school; plans are to expand the existing study to an entire school district over five years. The proposed work will be conducted in three phases. During Phase I, the study will develop a conceptual framework focused on inclusive science curricula, and implement the new teacher professional development program in 3 high schools with 15 science teachers. Phase II will expand to 6 middle schools in the school district with 24 teachers aimed at creating a continuous and sustainable research-practice partnership approach at the district.

One of the central tenets of computer science is that it is a collaborative discipline, yet children do not start out with an intrinsic ability to collaborate. The project will provide the opportunity for upper elementary students to learn computer science and build strong collaboration practices. Leveraging the promise of virtual learning companions, the project will address three thrusts. First, the project will collect datasets of collaborative learning for computer science in diverse upper elementary school classrooms. Second, the project will design, develop, and iteratively refine its intelligent virtual learning companions, which support dyads of students in a scaffolded computer science learning environment with an interactive online coding tool. Third, the project will generate research findings and evidence about how children collaborate in computer science learning, and how best to support their collaboration with intelligent virtual learning companions. There will be three families of deliverables: learning activities and professional development, an intelligent learning environment with virtual learning companions, and research evidence that furthers the state of scholarship and practice surrounding the collaborative learning of computer science. The project will situate itself in highly diverse elementary schools in two states, Durham County, North Carolina and Alachua County, Florida. This project is supported by the Discovery Research PreK-12 program, which funds research and development of STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>The project addresses the research question, ""How can we support upper elementary-school students in computer science learning and collaboration using intelligent virtual learning companions?"" The initial dataset will provide a ground-truth measure of students' collaboration approaches to classroom computer science learning tasks through instrumenting computer labs in elementary schools for collecting dialogue and problem-solving activity. The project will collect triangulating qualitative data to better understand impactful classroom dynamics around dyadic learning of computer science. The technical innovation of the project is the way in which student dyads are supported: each pair of children within the elementary school classroom will interact with a dyad of state of-the-art intelligent virtual learning companions. These companions will enhance the classroom experience by adapting in real time to the students' patterns of collaboration and problem solving to provide tailored support specifically for that pair of students. The virtual learning companions will model crucial dimensions of healthy collaboration through their dialogue with one another, including self-explanation, question generation, attributing challenges to the task and not to deficits in each other, and establishing common ground through uptake of ideas. The project will compare outcomes of computer science learning as measured in two ways: individual pre-test to post-test, and quality of collaboratively produced solutions. The project team will measure collaborative practices through dialogue analysis for the target collaboration strategies, as well as interest and self-efficacy for computer science. The project will utilize a multilevel model design to study the effect of the virtual learning companions on student outcomes. Using speech, dialogue transcripts, code artifact analysis, and multimodal analysis of gesture and facial expression, the team will conduct sequential analyses that identify the virtual learning companion interactions that are particularly beneficial for students, and focus our development efforts on expanding and refining those interactions. They will also identify the affordances that students did not engage with and determine whether to eliminate or re-cast them. The analytics of collaborative process data will once again be augmented with qualitative classroom data from field notes, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews with students and teachers. The themes that emerge will guide subsequent refinement of the environment and learning activities."

The Standards' Three-Dimensional Learning Framework has also required more creative and non-conventional professional development models to support the changing landscape of science education and instruction. This project intends to address this critical need at the elementary school level through an innovative collaborative professional development model. The University of New Hampshire, in partnership with New Hampshire Schools, will bring together two groups of educators - elementary school teachers (formal) and cooperative extension science volunteers (informal) -  to create a community-based professional development partnership that improves educators' self-efficacy, science content knowledge, and instructional practice. The model builds on the premise that both groups have expertise that can be shared and collaboratively developed. Together, with an interdisciplinary team of education experts, the teacher and extension science volunteers will learn how to design and implement appropriate, NGSS-aligned science lessons with elementary school students through locally relevant community-based, citizen science projects. This is a particularly novel approach. Though both groups are highly regarded for their contributions to elementary science education in their respective domains (i.e., formal and informal settings), few, if any, existing models examine the potential impact of partnering the groups together in a shared professional development experience.  <br/><br/>This Early Stage Design and Development project will partner and engage approximately 50 elementary school teachers (grades 2nd-5th) and 30 extension science volunteers from urban and rural New Hampshire in the year-long professional development program. Over a three-year period, the target groups will participate in workshops and citizen science investigations related to biodiversity, soil science, stream ecology, plant phenology and/or wildlife habitats. Program content and activities will be aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards and New Hampshire State Standards. A mixed methods approach will be employed to explore three aspects of the elementary school teacher?s efficacy over time. The research questions will seek to address: (1) What changes occur in elementary school teachers? self-efficacy teaching science and in their ability to integrate NGSS science practices through locally relevant citizen science projects? (2) What shifts occur in teacher content knowledge and how do the shifts in teacher content knowledge relate to the changes in teacher self-efficacy? (3) What is the process of collaboration between extension science volunteers and teachers? Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and documents/artifacts. Formative and summative evaluations will be provided by an Advisory Board of experts with a broad range of relevant expertise. The outcomes of this project have the potential to impact professional development approaches across the country and will support the goal of increasing public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology by optimizing elementary teachers' implementation of locally-relevant citizen science in their classrooms.  Similarly, by promoting a connection between the volunteers and local schools, this innovative model provides a new avenue for extension science volunteers to impact their communities.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

Yet, research has demonstrated the critical importance of early learning on individual potential. Building on evidence that movement is tightly intertwined with thinking, this project will investigate how thought and movement link as embodied learning to accelerate science understanding. Research will be conducted in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) with the aim to gather evidence for embodied interactions during science learning and articulate design principles about how museum exhibits can most effectively encourage cognitive and physical engagement with science. Such guidelines are largely absent in the field of informal STEM learning, and so this project seeks transformational change in how learning is understood and recognizes that changes in knowledge can be developed and revealed through body-based movements as well as verbally. Such a view is critically important given that many early learners communicate understanding through nonverbal channels before verbal. Research will be conducted with a diverse population of children and will explore the application of embodied learning to communities that are underrepresented in STEM. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.<br/><br/>During a 3-year period, researcher-practitioner teams across six museum sites will collaboratively investigate the links between movement and learning outcomes at selected science exhibits designed for young learners. Research activities will involve iteration and refinement of new instruments and protocols, through analysis of observed and automated capture of interaction data, and synthesis and interpretation of data. A design-based research methodology will be applied to address three key questions: 1) What elements of sensory and action experiences are key to informing the design of exhibits that aim to exploit embodied interactions for learning; 2) What is the role of bodily enactment /gestures in assessing children's understanding of science concepts; and 3) What cultural differences in kinds of embodied engagement emerge across diverse museum settings? Video and audio data of 400 children's exhibit interactions will be collected. Pre/post semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of these participants and will focus on children's understanding of relevant science concepts as well as personal reflections on their physical and emotional experience engaging with the exhibit. This project would raise awareness of embodied approaches to learning as well as build stronger collaborations between informal STEM educators and cognitive researchers. Utilization of informal and formal dissemination networks will support wide diffusion of project outcomes. This is critically important given strong evidence pointing to the impact of preschool education in underserved populations, and ongoing national efforts by the US and UK to improve the quality of STEM learning in preschool contexts."

Reflection plays a critical role in student learning and encompasses a broad range of cognitive and metacognitive processes enabling students to (1) think critically about their learning processes, (2) integrate new information with prior knowledge, (3) form and adapt learning strategies, (4) view concepts and knowledge from multiple perspectives, (5) generate self-explanations to enrich conceptual understanding, (6) compare learning processes and artifacts to those created by experts and peers, and (7) make metacognitive judgments about knowledge. The National Research Council recently concluded that systematic reflection is essential for deep learning and effective educational practice. This project investigates a suite of theoretically grounded, adaptive game-based reflection tools to scaffold students' cognitive and metacognitive reflection with the overarching objective of improving middle school students' science problem-solving processes. These reflection tools are integrated as part of the existing Crystal Island learning environment.<br/><br/>In studying middle school students' cognitive and metacognitive reflective processes, three key research questions will be addressed: 1) How do embedded and retrospective reflection scaffolds promote improved learning outcomes including science problem-solving skills, science content knowledge, metacognitive awareness, and reflection skills? 2) How can learning analytics be leveraged to extend models of reflection and self-regulated learning for problem solving within game-based learning environments? and 3) How can we create adaptive scaffolding for game-based learning environments that best foster reflection during and following science problem solving? The project builds upon a theoretical framework of self-regulated learning to inform the development of embedded and retrospective scaffold tools, gathering both process data (e.g., log data, eye tracking, think-aloud) and outcome data (e.g., pre- post- learning, transfer, metacognition, self-efficacy) to inform design principles and descriptive models of the role of reflection in students' problem-solving processes. Key project outcomes include an empirically grounded theoretical framework for reflection-enhanced learning and learning analytic techniques that yield predictive models of reflection in science problem solving."

Young students will investigate stories from their families and local communities that help them better understand, appreciate, and become interested in how STEM knowledge and skills directly impact their lives and could lead to potential career paths.  Utilizing geographic information systems (GIS) and digital mapping technologies, students in grades 3-5 at two public elementary schools will conduct multi-modal research projects to illuminate examples of STEM engagement in their own communities. With the aid of their teachers and university-based researchers, students will examine the science and mathematics embedded within the activities and resources of their local communities. Students will interview family and community members about how they use mathematics and science in their daily lives, and the focus of their scientific and mathematical inquiries will vary by grade level to align with the specific science content emphasized across grades and the developmental levels of the students. Teachers will incorporate student findings into class-related activities, and students, working closely with their teachers and researchers, will produce multimedia artifacts that include an interactive map embedded with student-created pins linking each student's STEM story project, including visuals, audio files and reports. These artifacts will be showcased during school-wide presentations to engage parents and other community members in breaking down racial and cultural divides. Student research will also be posted on the school websites and shared with other educators via social media and publications. <br/><br/>This research and development project will examine student, teacher, and community outcomes associated with implementation of a STEM curriculum model that aims to frame student home environments as STEM-rich communities.  Project research will be guided by the following question: How do racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse elementary school communities' investigation, analysis and dissemination of students' STEM Stories affect: (a) Elementary students' science, technology, engineering, and mathematics engagement and achievement outcomes?  (b) Teachers' understanding of STEM and their instructional practices, particularly as these relate to teachers' diverse students? And (c) Educators, parents and students intercultural understanding of the ways in which math and science exist in all students' lives? Researchers will collect achievement data and conduct pre- and post- intervention interviews with educators, students and parents to measure changes in STEM motivation and engagement as well as understandings of the contributions and utilization of science and mathematics across separate racial and ethnic communities. The overarching goal of this project is to strengthen school, family, neighborhood, and community ties through STEM learning and engagement. The project aims to develop student research and STEM skills, knowledge, and dispositions; to develop and enhance elementary teacher curricular and instructional repertoires around STEM concepts; and to enhance and broaden parent understanding of STEM to include the diverse community contexts that students in these schools call home.  The project will consist of five stages: Inquiry, Community Exploration, Pedagogical Incorporation, Public Engagement, and Digital Storytelling.  During the Inquiry phase, students will work with teachers and researchers to identify and explore STEM concepts meaningful to them in their schools, homes, and neighborhoods, and design a research protocol for the next phase.  During the Community Exploration phase, students will interview key representatives of STEM in the local community, including family members, community leaders, and neighbors, and consolidate data on interactive, web-based maps that convey their research findings. In the Pedagogical Incorporation phase to follow, there will be a series of workshops to help students develop STEM stories and design instructional tasks and projects centered around them.  During the Public Engagement phase and the Digital Storytelling phase, students design and share artifacts related to STEM stories developed by students and analyzed by teachers and project assistants. A mixed methods approach will be used to analyze quantitative associated with survey and assessment data and to interpret qualitative analysis of artifacts and interviews.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the central tenets of computer science is that it is a collaborative discipline, yet children do not start out with an intrinsic ability to collaborate. The project will provide the opportunity for upper elementary students to learn computer science and build strong collaboration practices. Leveraging the promise of virtual learning companions, the project will address three thrusts. First, the project will collect datasets of collaborative learning for computer science in diverse upper elementary school classrooms. Second, the project will design, develop, and iteratively refine its intelligent virtual learning companions, which support dyads of students in a scaffolded computer science learning environment with an interactive online coding tool. Third, the project will generate research findings and evidence about how children collaborate in computer science learning, and how best to support their collaboration with intelligent virtual learning companions. There will be three families of deliverables: learning activities and professional development, an intelligent learning environment with virtual learning companions, and research evidence that furthers the state of scholarship and practice surrounding the collaborative learning of computer science. The project will situate itself in highly diverse elementary schools in two states, Durham County, North Carolina and Alachua County, Florida. This project is supported by the Discovery Research PreK-12 program, which funds research and development of STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>The project addresses the research question, ""How can we support upper elementary-school students in computer science learning and collaboration using intelligent virtual learning companions?"" The initial dataset will provide a ground-truth measure of students' collaboration approaches to classroom computer science learning tasks through instrumenting computer labs in elementary schools for collecting dialogue and problem-solving activity. The project will collect triangulating qualitative data to better understand impactful classroom dynamics around dyadic learning of computer science. The technical innovation of the project is the way in which student dyads are supported: each pair of children within the elementary school classroom will interact with a dyad of state of-the-art intelligent virtual learning companions. These companions will enhance the classroom experience by adapting in real time to the students' patterns of collaboration and problem solving to provide tailored support specifically for that pair of students. The virtual learning companions will model crucial dimensions of healthy collaboration through their dialogue with one another, including self-explanation, question generation, attributing challenges to the task and not to deficits in each other, and establishing common ground through uptake of ideas. The project will compare outcomes of computer science learning as measured in two ways: individual pre-test to post-test, and quality of collaboratively produced solutions. The project team will measure collaborative practices through dialogue analysis for the target collaboration strategies, as well as interest and self-efficacy for computer science. The project will utilize a multilevel model design to study the effect of the virtual learning companions on student outcomes. Using speech, dialogue transcripts, code artifact analysis, and multimodal analysis of gesture and facial expression, the team will conduct sequential analyses that identify the virtual learning companion interactions that are particularly beneficial for students, and focus our development efforts on expanding and refining those interactions. They will also identify the affordances that students did not engage with and determine whether to eliminate or re-cast them. The analytics of collaborative process data will once again be augmented with qualitative classroom data from field notes, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews with students and teachers. The themes that emerge will guide subsequent refinement of the environment and learning activities."

This collaborative approach not only makes scientific information more readily available, it also engages community members in the processes of scientific inquiry, synthesis, data interpretation, and the translation of results into action. This project will build a co-created citizen science program coupled with a peer education model and an extensive communication of results to increase environmental STEM literacy. The project targets historically underrepresented populations that are likely to be disproportionately impacted by climate, water scarcity, and food security. Based upon past needs assessments in the targeted communities, gardens irrigated by harvested rainwater will become hubs for environmental STEM education and research. <br/><br/>For this project, gardens irrigated by harvested rainwater will serve as hubs for environmental literacy education efforts. Researchers from the University of Arizona and Sonora Environmental Research Institute will work alongside community environmental health workers, who will then train families residing in environmentally compromised areas (urban and rural) on how to monitor their soil, plant, and harvested water quality. The project aims to: (1) co-produce environmental monitoring, exposure, and risk data in a form that will be directly relevant to the participants' lives, (2) increase the community's involvement in environmental decision-making, and (3) improve environmental STEM literacy and learning in underserved rural and urban communities. The project will investigate and gather extensive quantitative and quantitative data to understand how: (1) participation in a co-created citizen science project enhances a participant's overall environmental STEM literacy; (2) a peer-education model coupled with a co-created citizen science program affects participation of historically underrepresented groups in citizen science; and (3) the environmental monitoring approach influences the participant's environmental health learning outcomes and understanding of the scientific method. In parallel, this project will evaluate the role of local-based knowledge mediators and different mechanisms to communicate results. These findings will advance the fields of informal science education, environmental science, and risk communication. Concomitantly, the project will facilitate the co-generation of a robust dataset that will not only inform guidelines and recommendations for harvested rainwater use, it will build capacity in underserved communities and inform the safe and sustainable production of food sources. This research effort is especially critical for populations in arid and semiarid environments, which account for ~40% of the global land area and are inhabited by one-third of the world's population. This program will be available in English and Spanish and can truly democratize environmental STEM research and policy.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understandings of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments."

This hands-on program in discovery and inquiry brings middle school students and teachers across the State of Maine to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) in Portland, Maine to become fully immersed in explorations into the complexities of local marine science ecosystems. These intensive field trip experiences are led by informal educators and facilitated entirely within informal contexts at GMRI. Approximately 70% of all fifth and sixth grade students in Maine participate in the program each year and more than 120,000 students have attended since the program's inception in 2005. Unfortunately, little is known to date on how the program has influenced practice and learning ecosystems within formal, informal, and community contexts. As such, this research in service to practice project will employ an innovative research approach to understand and advance knowledge on the short and long-term impacts of the program within different contexts. If proven effective, the LabVenture program will elucidate the potential benefits of a large-scale field trip program implemented systemically across a community over time and serve as a reputable model for statewide adoption of similar programs seeking innovative strategies to connect formal and informal science learning to achieve notable positive shifts in their local, statewide, or regional STEM learning ecosystems. <br/><br/>Over the four-year project duration, the project will reach all 16 counties in the State of Maine. The research design includes a multi-step, multi-method approach to gain insight on the primary research questions. The initial research will focus on extant data and retrospective data sources codified over the 12-year history of the program. The research will then be expanded to garner prospective data on current participating students, teachers, and informal educators. Finally, a community study will be conducted to understand the potential broader impacts of the program. Each phase of the research will consider the following overarching research questions are: (1) How do formal and informal practitioners perceive the value and purposes of the field trip program and field trip experiences more broadly (field trip ontology)? (2) To what degree do short-term field trip experiences in informal contexts effect cognitive and affective outcomes for students? (3) How are community characteristics (e.g., population, distance from GMRI, proximity to the coast) related to ongoing engagement with the field trip program? (4) What are aspects of the ongoing field trip program that might embed it as an integral element of community culture (e.g., community awareness of a shared social experience)? (5) To what degree does a field trip experience that is shared by schools across a state lead to a traceable change that can be measured for those who participated and across the broader community? and (6) In what ways, if at all, can a field trip experience that occurs in informal contexts have an influence on the larger learning ecosystem (e.g., the Maine education system)? Each phase of the research will be led by a team of researchers with the requisite expertise in the methodologies and contexts required to carry out that particular aspect of the research (i.e., retrospective study, prospective study, community study). In addition, evaluation and practitioner panels of experts will provide expertise and guidance on the research, evaluation, and project implementation. The project will culminate with a practitioner convening, to share project findings more broadly with formal and informal practitioners, and promote transfer from research to practice. Additional dissemination strategies include conferences, network meetings, and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>The potential insights this research could garner on intersectionality between formal and informal STEM learning are substantial. As a consequence, this project is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) and Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) Programs. The Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. Likewise, the Discovery Research-K12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. Based on findings from research on effective science teaching supporting the notion that meaningful learning occurs when teachers attend to students' thinking, this project will conduct an in-depth investigation of teachers' knowledge of noticing students' science thinking in terms of what they do and say, to not only attend to their ideas, but also to make sense of and respond to those ideas. The work will be grounded on the premise that there is a relationship between teachers' practice and knowledge, and that it is possible to observe practice in order to infer knowledge. The project will examine teacher noticing in practice, use empirical evidence to model the specialized teacher knowledge involved, and design teacher learning materials informed by the model. The setting of the study will include an existing school-university partnership serving diverse student populations in Appalachian communities, where students significantly underperform nationally in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics areas across grades levels. It will target fifth grade science teachers' noticing their students' thinking as they engage in science learning in six rural and semi-rural elementary schools.<br/><br/>The three research questions will be: (1) What disciplinary ideas in students' thinking do elementary teachers notice in practice?; (2) What knowledge do elementary teachers draw on when noticing the disciplinary ideas in students' thinking in practice?; and (3) How does a set of web-based interactive instructional materials support teachers' knowledge construction around noticing the disciplinary ideas in students' thinking in science? In order to investigate teachers' noticing students' thinking, and answer the research questions, the project will use two wearable technologies to collect data of teachers' ""in-the-moment"" noticing while engaged in planning, instructional, and assessment  activities. One is a point-of-view digital video system consisting of three parts: a small video camera, a hand-held remote, and a separate recording module. The other is an audio-recording wristband with a recording mode allowing the user to capture previous one-minute loops of audio data. An audio loop is saved whenever the user taps the wristband. Data will be analyzed for evidence of students' disciplinary knowledge and skills in order to give insight of teachers' knowledge involved in noticing each instance using the three interconnected dimensions featured in ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"" (National Research Council, 2012). The project will consist of four strands of work: (1) empirically investigating teachers' noticing of students' thinking; (2) developing an initial conceptual model of teachers' knowledge of noticing students' thinking; (3) conducting design-based research to develop instructional materials supporting teachers' knowledge construction around noticing students' thinking in science; and (4) producing and disseminating these instructional materials through an interactive web-based platform. The main outcomes of this project will be (a) an empirically grounded model of fifth grade teachers' knowledge of noticing Appalachian students' thinking in science; and (b) the design of web-based interactive instructional materials supporting fifth grade teachers' knowledge construction around noticing Appalachian students' thinking in science. These outcomes will serve as the foundation for a more comprehensive future research agenda testing and refining the initial model and instructional materials in other learning environments in order to eventually contribute to a practice-based theory of teachers' knowledge of noticing students' thinking in science to inform and impact science teaching practice. An advisory board will oversee the project's progress, and an external evaluator will conduct both formative and summative evaluation."

The ECR program of fundamental research in STEM education provides funding in critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring. EHR seeks proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The ECR program is distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation. The proposed study will explore trajectories of development in high school and undergraduate students' understanding of evidence in the context of biology teaching and learning. One of the difficulties experienced by many science learners is that they do not fully understand the evidence base that underpins contemporary science. This study will examine students' developing understanding of evidence in the context of biology learning. This research will contribute to fundamental knowledge on STEM learning and STEM learning environments by providing information on trajectories of development in students' understanding and use of evidence as a central part of their learning in biology through the secondary and post-secondary years. The project will also provide information on how variations in how teachers and instructional materials support students' understanding and reasoning about evidence influence this development. The instructional resources developed as part of this project (e.g., grade band appropriate teacher guides and exemplars of supported assignments and assessments) will be of direct value to biology educators. The outcomes of this study will help educators better prepare students who want to pursue careers in science, including research careers. Furthermore, knowledge developed by the project may support the development of scientific literacy and participation in evidence-based decision making around public policy on scientific issues among citizens.<br/><br/>The project will use a design-based research approach to achieve the following objectives: a) Develop a conceptual analysis of varied facets of disciplinary evidence that are important to evolutionary thinking in biology learning; b) Describe trajectories of learning in high school and undergraduate students' understanding and use of biological evidence for evolution; c) Examine how variations in instructional scaffolding relate to patterns of student learning within each grade band; and d) Develop design knowledge to facilitate integration of disciplinary evidence scaffolding in high school and undergraduate biology instruction. First, data will be collected on what students know and learn about biological evidence in the context of routine biology instruction. Subsequently the team will integrate instructional scaffolds that foster more nuanced and multifaceted understandings of biological evidence. Two variations will be examined: 1) Generic evidence scaffolds will remind students of different aspects of using evidence in science (e.g. ""refer to all the evidence when constructing an explanation""), but without explicit links to relevant disciplinary knowledge for each aspect. 2) disciplinary evidence scaffolds will explicitly remind students of key disciplinary knowledge related to each aspect of evidence. The project will use a mixed method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative cognitive science techniques to collect and analyze data from a) student learning artifacts, b) pre and posttests of biology content knowledge, and their understanding and use of evidence in biology, c) videotaped classroom lessons, and d) interviews with teachers and students. These methods will allow for quantitative comparisons of group performance across the two instructional conditions and supplement these comparisons with rich descriptive data about how students learn in varied instructional contexts."

Increasingly, all STEM fields rely on being able to understand data and use statistics. This project builds on prior efforts to create teaching resources for high-school Advanced Placement Statistics teachers to use an open source statistics programming language called ""R"" in their classrooms. The project brings together datasets from a variety of STEM domains, and will develop exercises and assessments to teach students how to program in R and learn the underlying statistics concepts. Thus, this project attempts to help students learn coding, statistics, and STEM simultaneously in the context of AP Stats. In addition, researchers will examine the extent to which students learn statistical concepts, computational fluency, and critical reasoning skills better with the online tools. <br/><br/>The resources developed by the project aim to enhance statistics learning through an integrated application of strategies previously documented to be effective: a focus on data visualization and representation, engaging students in meaningful investigations with complex real-world data sets, utilizing computational tools and techniques to analyze data, and better preparing educators for the needs of a more complex and technologically-rich mathematical landscape. This project will unite these lines of work into one streamlined pedagogical environment called CodeR4STATS with three kinds of resources: computing resources, datasets, and assessment resources. Computing resources will include freely available access to an instance of the cloud-based R-studio with custom help pages. Data resources will include over 800 scientific datasets from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Boston University, and Tufts University with several highlighted in case studies for students; these will be searchable within the online environment. Assessment and tutoring resources will be provided using the tutoring platform ASSISTments which uses example tracing to provide assessment, feedback, and tailored instruction.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Strong knowledge of measurement and data analysis is essential to ensure competiveness of the nation as a whole and full access to educational and work opportunities for all students. Despite this importance, a considerable number of U.S. students, particularly students from poor and minority backgrounds, struggle with these two areas of mathematics. The purpose of this 4-year Research and Development project, Precision Mathematics (PM): Building Student Proficiency in the Foundational Concepts and Problem Solving Skills of Measurement and Data Analysis, is to improve student mathematics achievement by developing a mathematics intervention focused on key measurement and data analysis skills. The PM intervention will be designed for first and second grade students who are experiencing mathematics difficulties. To increase student mathematics achievement, the intervention will include: (a) a technology-based component that will provide students with individualized instruction and (b) hands-on activities that will offer opportunities for students to interact with their teacher and peers around critical measurement and data analysis concepts. Primary activities of the project will include intervention development, pilot testing, data analysis, and intervention revision. One primary benefit of PM is that it will provide struggling learners with meaningful access to critical concepts and skills identified in the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Another benefit is that will be designed to serve as a foundation for students to understand more advanced mathematical concepts introduced in the later grades. PM has the potential to address a concerning gap in U.S. education. To date, intervention research focused on measurement and data analysis is scant.<br/><br/>Proficiency with measurement and data analysis is essential for obtaining occupations in the STEM fields. A primary aim of this project is to develop PM, a mathematics intervention designed to teach key concepts of measurement and data analysis to at-risk 1st and 2nd grade students. Comprising the intervention will be technology-based and collaborative problem-solving activities. At each grade, the intervention will provide 20 hours of instruction focused on topics identified in the Common Core State Standards. A primary aim of the project is to develop the intervention using a design science approach, including a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods that will guide iterative testing and revision cycles. A second primary aim is to test the promise of the intervention to improve student mathematics achievement. Rigorous pilot studies (i.e., randomized controlled trials) will be conducted in 1st and 2nd grade classrooms involving over 700 at-risk students. Within classrooms, students will be randomly assigned to treatment (PM) or control conditions (business as usual). Two research questions will be addressed: (a) What is the potential promise of the intervention when delivered in authentic education settings?

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is a four-year design and development study submitted to the assessment strand of the program. It will focus on understanding how educational games, designed according to research-based learning and assessment design principles, can better assess and promote students' science knowledge, application of science process skills, and motivation and engagement in learning. The project will develop a new genre of games to serve as formative assessment resources designed to collect evidence of science learning during gameplay, provide feedback and coaching in the form of hints, and reinforce middle grade (6th-8th) students' life science concepts and investigation practices about ecosystems described in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Achieve, 2013). The games will build on the designs of the simulation-based, curriculum-embedded assessments developed in previous NSF-funded efforts, which include student progress reports and reflection activities that allow teachers to provide feedback to students and adjust instruction. The design of the games will draw from multiple lines of research, such as cognition, particularly model-based learning; principled assessment design; and motivation. Intended to provide engaging activities for understanding and investigating the system components, roles, interactions, and population dynamics of ecosystems, the project will produce two sets of comprehensive games: (1) Organisms and Interactions, and (2) Emergent Population Levels: Managing an Ecosystem. Each game will consist of progressively advanced mini-games. Twenty-four California Bay Area middle school teachers will participate in the study. Teacher professional development (PD) will include face-to-face sessions and an online platform that permits a wide range of interactions among participants and the facilitators. The PD will emphasize the alignment of the ecosystem simulation-based curriculum modules with their state standards, instructional materials, and the new games. <br/><br/>The project will address six research questions: (1) How well do the games align with the ecosystem crosscutting concepts, core ideas, and inquiry practices in the NGSS?; (2) How well do game components meet quality standards?; (3) How well do the games integrate with the existing simulation-based curriculum modules and the teachers' existing instructional sequence?; (4) What effect does the use of the games have on students' understanding of the science concepts, scientific practices, and collaboration skills?; (5) How does success in gameplay relate to improved performance on the external outcome measures comprised of the simulation-based benchmark and the pre/posttest?; and (6) How does the use of the games affect students' engagement in science learning? In a Year 1 usability study, the project will test, analyze, and revise alpha versions of the games. In Year 2, a classroom feasibility study of beta versions will inform further revisions. In Year 3, six teachers will pilot-test the games. A second pilot test in Year 4 will examine the effectiveness of the games by comparing student performance in classes using the existing simulation-based curriculum-embedded assessments and reflection activities with classes using the curriculum-embedded assessments plus the new games. Data collection and analysis strategies include: (a) alignment reviews; (b) focus groups and usability testing; (c) cognitive labs for construct validity and usability; (d) game reports (badges); (e) pre/posttest of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) items; (f) benchmark assessment data; (g) student interest in the games and science; (h) teacher surveys; (i) case studies; (j) game quality analysis; (k) differential item functioning; (l) analysis of covariance; and (m) analysis of variance on posttest scores (outcome variable) to compare the means across student groups (by intervention mode) and their prior science achievement levels."

Closing Gaps: Connecting Assessment and Culture to Increase Achievement, a three-year design and development study, opens new doors for understanding how technology can enhance teaching and learning. The project focuses on ways in which technology-rich learning environments can improve instruction and assessment practices for diverse indigenous students. It combines two innovative learning technologies -- SimScientists and FieldScope -- that support STEM teaching and learning through the practices of science. Teachers in the Na Lei Na'auao Native Hawaiian Charter School Alliance use these innovative technologies in their classrooms and on ecosystems-themed field trips. Project researchers will study how features of each technology can foster learning and enhance assessment. The project addresses a persistent limitation of STEM learning: students' lack of access to connected and familiar experiences that can help build foundational knowledge. Although new technologies to support STEM learning are available each year, many deliver inaccessible information because the context of the information is unfamiliar and does not relate to children's own experiences and intuitive knowledge. This promotes fragile understandings rather than the kinds of knowledge valued by NGSS and in work environments. This project explores how to design educational learning tools that can be adapted to a local context yet be standardized enough to align with state and national guidelines. Findings may prove critical in improving test development practices for diverse populations. Testing in diverse indigenous communities is underexplored; little is known about how assessments can be adapted to serve the dual role of assessing content and practice standards while attending to specifics of the local context. This project intends to enhance the educational advancement of all students in STEM areas.<br/><br/>This project intends to advance the field of educational technology to maximize benefits of cultural and contextual diversity in technology-rich learning environments. It addresses four research questions: (1) Can features of two learning technologies be customized to be both contextually relevant and aligned with standardized learning goals?; (2) Can technology-rich learning environments be used to make salient connections between instruction and the culture in which learning is situated?; (3) Can assessment embedded into technology-rich learning environments be responsive to ways of knowing and demonstrating understanding unique to an indigenous culture?; and (4) Can assessment embedded in technology-rich learning environments support inferences about student understanding of the practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts of science with appropriate and sufficient evidence? In Year 1, the project will conduct initial feasibility studies with students and teachers to inform revisions to existing SimScientists modules and reflection activities. In Year 2, the project will revise existing modules to enhance their cultural relevance and then conduct small-scale usability and feasibility testing with the revised modules. In Year 3, the customized modules will be piloted with 12 teachers. Data collection and analysis strategies include: (a) design charrettes; (b) focus groups and usability testing; (c) cognitive labs for cultural relevance, construct validity and innovation impacts; (d) pre/posttest of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) items; (e) benchmark assessment data; (f) teacher surveys; (i) case studies; (j) classroom and field trip participant observations (k) differential item functioning; (l) analysis of covariance; and (m) analysis of variance on posttest scores (outcome variable) to compare the means across student groups (by intervention mode) and their prior science achievement levels to measure the technical quality of the assessments. Project success means students will make personal connections between the knowledge they gain throughout the course of their lives and the knowledge that is important in STEM fields, offering additional ways to see the value and possibilities of STEM careers."

Research suggests that computational literacy--knowing what, when, how, and why to use the ideas of computer science, in combination with the capacity to view problems and potential solutions through the lens of computational structures and procedures--can be supported through digital game play. This project aims to develop a social and creative exhibit game that foregrounds aspects of computer science, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and computer programming, in ways that enable youth to explore, construct, and share computational complex systems content with one another and other museum visitors. To play the game, pairs of youth visitors will use code cards to program the behavior of AI animals in a virtual forest. As they do so, youth will engage with computational literacy practices, such as basic computer programming, describing their computational ideas, and doing computational problem solving with their friends. Their activity will be projected on a large screen as a strategy for enabling youth to test, rehearse, and communicate their computational ideas and to also interest other visitors into computational problem solving.<br/><br/>Using multi-perspective and iterative design-based research, university learning scientists, museum practitioners, and game developers will pursue research questions around how science museums can better engage youth who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science in complex computational practices. Data sources will include interactive-log data, observations of visitor interactions with the game, visitor interviews, and visitor surveys. A multimodal and mixed methods approach that searches for convergences between qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and learning analytics will be used to generate research findings. Changes in computational literacy will be assessed by evaluating what problems visitors choose to solve with programming, how they frame those problems, and their selections from among possible solutions, what they program, how they program, and how they describe programming ideas. The results of this project will include: 1) a social, interactive gameplay experience that supports the development of computational literacy; 2) design principles for game-based exhibits that facilitate development of computational literacy; and 3) new knowledge of variations in design and gameplay across diverse gameplay users, including those from underrepresented groups in computer science. It is anticipated that 1,000 museum youth visitors will directly participate in the study.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

Moreover, these state science standards introduce earth and space science content in the early elementary grades. This creates a critical need for new pedagogies, materials, and resources for science teachers in all grades, but the need is particularly urgent in grades K-3 where teachers have had little preparation to teach science, let alone astronomy. There is also growing consensus that when learning opportunities in formal and informal settings are closely aligned, children's science literacy is developed in ways greater than either setting can achieve alone. The investigators will study if, how, and under what circumstances an integration of literacy strategies, hands-on inquiry-based investigations, and planetarium experiences supports the development of science practices (noticing, recognizing change, making predictions, and constructing explanations) in early elementary level students. This project will generate knowledge about how astronomy-focused storybooks, hands-on investigations, and planetarium experiences can be integrated to develop age-appropriate science practices in very young children (noticing, recognizing change, making predictions, and constructing explanations). This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of STEM by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Emergent research on the development of children's science thinking indicates that when young children are engaged with science-focused storybooks and activities that each highlight the same phenomenon, children notice and gather evidence, make predictions and claims based on evidence, and provide explanations grounded in the experiences provided to them. This project has two phases. In Phase 1, first and third grade teachers will be recruited. They will help identify specific learner needs as these relate to the earth and space science standards in their grade band, assist in the development and pilot testing of a prototype instructional sequence and supporting activities taking place within their classrooms and at a local planetarium. In Phase 2, the revised learning sequence and research protocol will be implemented with the same teachers and a new cohort of children. The mixed method research design includes video observations, teacher interviews, and teacher and student surveys. Data analysis will focus on science practices, connections across contexts (e.g., school and planetarium), and instructional adaptations. The project involves a research-practice collaboration between the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Rockman & Associates, the Lawrence Hall of Science [University of California, Berkeley], and West Chester University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By creating a connected community, it will promote a robust culture of sharing knowledge from experts (both within and external to the community), lessons learned in near-real time associated with implementation, having sharing common metrics that are both supportive of the projects and the program overall, and shared means of dissemination to broader communities of researchers and practitioners. This project has the broader potential of serving as a model for NSF programs for proactively developing the methods for shared learning and common metrics that have more commonly been developed and implemented at much later stages.<br/><br/>To both support the projects and maintain awareness of the larger initiatives, we propose a Connected Community of Practice (CCOP). A Researcher-Evaluator Working Group (R-EWG) will form to provide a process for pursuing the shared research agenda developed through the CCOP. This structure will facilitate data collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination at a program level. The approach will also generate a mechanism for those outside of the immediate RPP community to benefit from this investment by engaging in learning from the participants that will add value to the initial investment by supporting those undertaking the RPP work and scaling to a broader audience. Recognizing that the funded partnerships will likely be highly diverse in terms of size, context, research area and strength of working relationships, the project will deeply engage evaluators and researchers at the onset of the program to collaboratively develop a shared data set to capture participation data across projects, co-define an RPP research agenda to advance the field of CT/CS educational knowledge, and use the CS for All infrastructure for collaboration, learning and dissemination. This approach will lay the foundation for program-wide assessment and learning. The project will facilitate the community in developing a framework for answering: 1. What are the RPP-specific activities that are high-leverage/highly effective in affecting quality computer science education? 2. What common indicators are appropriate to collect across CS for All: RPP projects to demonstrate the relative and overall effectiveness of the RPP projects? 3. Using these indicators, what are the outcomes and impact of the CS for All: RPP projects for districts, teachers and students?"

This effort will address the need to prepare and inspire up to 6500 students to become interested and motivated in STEM fields and careers. Students will have opportunities to increase their knowledge and skills in earth system sciences topics by engaging in authentic online local and global activities; collaborating with peers on data-driven research projects, and interacting with scientists and mentors in face-to-face settings. Pre-service and in-service teachers will participate in summer institutes, academic year workshops, and in-class sessions to learn about and use pedagogies that will help them attract and retain more students in education pathways to STEM careers. These professional growth opportunities will be led by university faculty members, content and evaluation experts, STEM professionals, industry and workforce development specialists and professional education organization consultants. The goal is to modify and refine a community-based model that will comprehensively address teacher preparedness and student participation in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The project will use a mixed method design to collect data about goals specific to K-12 students' level of awareness and interest in STEM careers, motivation to pursue the education necessary for these careers, improvement in 21st century skill development, and acquisition of STEM content knowledge through collaborative technology practices. Pre-post surveys, observations, interviews, focus group discussions, communication chat groups, and descriptive statistics will be used to capture data about the influence of project activities on students and teachers. Project outcomes will include the development of curriculum units that employ technology-driven project-based collaboration; embody intercultural competence, and promote the understanding of content knowledge in the earth sciences as well as 21st Century workforce skills. Outcomes will also include teacher professional development processes and material for preparing teachers to deliver these technology-based STEM units that will impact more than 20 metropolitan area school districts that will be reached through this effort. Beyond dissemination to partnering school districts, project results will also be disseminated at national and regional meetings and conferences such as the National Science Teachers Association, the International Society for Technology in Education, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and the American Educational Research Association. Publications will also be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. Project partners including the GLOBE Implementation Office, University of Colorado at Boulder's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Open World Learning, and the Colorado Workforce Development Council will promote and disseminate results through their distribution and communication channels. Social media, especially those geared towards educators, will be utilized to promote project outcomes to appropriate groups in the educational community."

Assessments are aligned with the performance assessment and evidence-centered design methodologies suggested in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012). The study focuses on the development of new measures of learning that take into account the interdependence of science content and practice. Two disciplinary core ideas--Matter and its Interactions, and Energy--and two scientific and engineering practices--Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, and Developing and Using Models--are used for this purpose. <br/><br/>The research questions are: (1) What are the characteristic features of science assessments based upon systematic application of the Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) assessment process?; (2) To what extent can assessment designs incorporate critical core idea, crosscutting concept and science/engineering practice dimensions in ways that both separate and integrate these dimensions as part of the design architecture?; (3) What is the evidence that the multiple dimensions of science learning (e.g., content, practices and crosscutting concepts) are separable and recoverable in the performance of students who respond to these assessments?; (4) How instructionally sensitive are these assessments? (i.e., Do they show differential and appropriate sensitivity to students' opportunity to learn science in ways consistent with the vision contained in the NRC Framework?); (5) What forms of evidence can be provided for the validity of these assessments using a multifaceted validity framework that takes into account both the interpretive and evidentiary components of a validity argument for these new assessments?; (6) What are the characteristics of assessments that best serve the needs of classroom teachers relative to a formative assessment process and in what ways do such assessments and scoring processes need to be designed to support effective teacher implementation?; and (7) What are the unique affordances and opportunities provided by technology in designing and implementing assessments focused on merging content & practices performance expectations? <br/><br/>Assessments are iteratively designed and administered in three school districts and a laboratory school in Florida and one school district in Wisconsin using the ""Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology"" curriculum. The three school districts in Florida have classrooms that are using typical curriculum. The assessments will also be administered and tested with students in these classrooms. To address the research questions, the project conducts five major tasks: (1) development of assessment items using the ECD process to document and guide coherence of items; (2) an alignment study to review design patterns and task templates; (3) a cognitive analysis study to empirically investigate the extent to which the items elicit the intended guidelines; (4) three empirical studies, including (a) an early-stage testing with teachers (n=6) and students (n=180) in Year 1, (b) a pilot testing in Year 2 with teachers (n=12) and students (n=360), and (c) a main study in Year 3 with teachers (n=30) and students (n=900); and (5) a study to investigate the formative use of the assessment items using teacher focus groups' feedback and analysis of student performance data from previous studies.  <br/><br/>Project outcomes are: (a) research-informed and field-tested assessment prototypes that measure students' thinking around the two physical science core ideas and the two scientific and engineering practices; (b) relevant data and procedures used in the studies; and (c) a framework for the formative use of the assessments, including guidelines, scoring rubrics, and criteria for assessment design decisions."

This project uses the software environment Minecraft, which has already attracted over 100 million users, as a platform for teaching middle schoolers about math and computing concepts. Curriculum and assessment 'badges' will be developed to motivate and teach youth. Research will study how implementing the curriculum in in-school settings, and in afterschool settings through 4-H, influences youngsters' knowledge of math and programming, their attitudes and inclination to STEM careers, and their standardized test scores.<br/><br/>This project proposes to use LearnToMod for Minecraft to engage rural middle school learners (5th to 8th grades) in programming, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving skills. LearnToMod will be piloted with approximately 80 4-H Extension participants and 80 in-school participants, and then a larger implementation will be launched to involve a total of approximately 1000 students in urban and rural areas through five more iterations of curricular refinement. Outcomes will be examined using case studies, participation logs, teacher and student surveys, the badges and embedded assessments developed by the project, and standardized test data from the Maine Department of Education's State Longitudinal Data System. The project will use multi-level mixture modeling to identify specific school characteristics that are associated with different usage and engagement patterns by both students and teachers. Similar analyses will use school-level variables and characteristics, such as poverty, access to resources, existing STEM programs/activities, etc., as predictors of implementation and change in reported teacher attitudes and behavior, such as incorporation of computer science into STEM areas. These analyses will focus on the cross-level interaction/moderator relationships between behaviors of participating students and teachers and school-level characteristics or demographics (e.g., what types of computer programming activities or skills are associated with the greatest change specifically in low-versus-high income schools?).The partnership consists of education and computer science researchers at the University of Maine, the nonprofit ThoughtSTEM, UMaine Cooperative Extension (4-H), the Network Maine state cyberinfrastructure project and the Maine Department of Education's Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI), plus K-12 partners. K-12 partners include the Western Foothills Regional School Unit, Eastern Maine AOS, Bangor School Department, Southern Maine SAD Cumberland and North Yarmouth, and the Maine Virtual Academy.

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new multidisciplinary approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning, and discipline-specific efforts in computing designed to build an evidence base for teaching and learning of computer science in K-12, including within diverse populations. In the case of astronomy, computing and computational thinking (CT) are used for nearly every aspect of collecting, processing, and analyzing data. Yet, few educational resources exist to support students in learning astronomy in the computationally-intensive way that it is practiced. Furthermore, the predominance of visual interfaces that support computing processes present unique challenges for blind and visually impaired (BVI) individuals. The dearth of vision-neutral tools in astronomy and computer science introduce additional barriers to learning and workforce entry for BVI individuals. To address these challenges, this project will develop, implement, and study an innovative educational program that provides BVI and sighted students with opportunities to learn how to apply computing and computational thinking to design fully-accessible astronomical tools and to use those tools for their own astronomy inquiry. Investigators hypothesize that students' participation in both the user-centered design/universal design process and in the use of the resulting tools for astronomy inquiry will foster learning and broaden interest and participation in the high-barrier disciplines of computer science and astronomy. Led by investigators at Associated Universities Inc., the project team includes astronomers, computer scientists, software engineers, education developers, and learning scientists from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Chicago Yerkes Observatory, TERC, and the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Approximately 200 BVI and sighted students near Yerkes Observatory and across the nation, will be involved with and benefit from the project. The demographically diverse student population will help the project achieve significant broader impacts, by assuring that the research findings and developed tools and resources reflect the needs of a broad diversity of people and places in which they learn. By enabling multi-sensory engagement for data acquisition, processing, and analysis processes, the developed tools will improve access to astronomy and to other visually- and computationally-intensive domains such as satellite, geophysical, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This project will address a daunting challenge to developing STEM literacy in students - integrating teaching and learning of key ideas and practices of science and computer science in authentic, innovative and effective ways - while instilling the societal value of computational tools that increase access for all. Key components of the education intervention include a) inquiry-based curricular modules and facilitated activities that teach computing in the context of astronomy; b) a scaffolded process of user-centered design/universal design that underscores computational thinking practices in the context of optimizing astronomy tools to be fully-accessible to all users; c) student-driven, authentic astronomy research; and d) BVI and sighted astronomers and computer scientists as mentors and role models to the community of learners.  The intervention will address relevant disciplinary content, practices, and computation as specified in Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core State Standards for mathematics, and K-12 Computer Science Standards. The project will engage 20 teachers and 200 students from mainstream and specialized schools for the blind over three years. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of student and teacher assessments, surveys, interviews, work products, and user' computer log files, and classroom observations will be used to determine the effectiveness and broad utility of the approach for integrating physics and computing The student-level research questions focus on how students' understanding and use of computational thinking develops in relation to astronomy and the specific astronomy tools they use; and how students' participation augments their interest, self-efficacy, and understandings of who can participate in astronomy and computing. The teacher-level research focuses on teachers' capacity to integrate astronomy and computing and to support BVI students' learning in their classrooms. The project will provide the first longitudinal study of student learning and behaviors in the context of integrating astronomy and computer science. It will deepen understanding of how multisensory computing inputs and outputs support learning for BVI and sighted students. The project will begin to inform the field about how BVI individuals can participate in the workforce at the intersection of high barrier-to-entry disciplines, astronomy and computer science. The project team and advisory board members will disseminate findings to their respective professional associations and networks, including the American Astronomical Society and the American Geophysical Union, and through traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. The accessible tools and educational resources produced in this study will be freely available to K-12 teachers nationwide and could be widely adopted by BVI and sighted individuals in astronomy and other visually-intensive domains."

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning. Computational Thinking (CT) is an intellectual skill rooted in the ability to conceive of meaningful, information-based representations that can be effectively manipulated by a computer. Integrating CT into core science instruction addresses practical constraints in K-12 education, in that there is no room in the curriculum to teach it directly to everyone. But, more importantly, integrating CT into core science provides a synergistic opportunity to deepen instruction in both. STEM education programs that effectively foster development of CT skills as an essential competency are among the most successful in preparing a future STEM workforce that can leverage computational methods to advance basic science and engineering research and design innovative approaches for using data-rich resources to solve complex, societally-relevant problems.  Similarly, a science-literate society increasingly needs to appreciate how advances in scientific knowledge are inter-woven with the use of big data, modeling, and simulations, if they are to make informed, evidence-based decisions. This project will explore the integration of core chemistry topics and computational thinking through student interaction with and manipulation of models that visually represent chemical systems, such as the carbon cycle.  When a student examines a visual, runnable model, makes a prediction, changes the programming code, and then runs the model again, the computer provides feedback to the student that demands explanation.  The process of anticipating, interpreting, and testing the computer's feedback, when coupled with a structured argumentation process, supports a student's abilities to think and act like a scientist as they explore and learn about both the computational and physical world.<br/><br/>Virginia Tech and the University of  Texas at Austin will investigate a method of broadening access to CT thinking by providing it in a context that all students take: 8th Grade Integrated Science. Targeted chemistry topics will be embedded into editable, runnable computational models that are themselves embedded within a pedagogy of structured scientific argumentation focused on the production of evidence-based reasoning. Students will learn about chemical systems, as well as key concepts such as equilibrium and reaction rates, through interacting with models as they are represented visually and about CT through modifying and adapting the code to better represent aspects of the chemical systems.  Four computational chemistry tasks, including computer models and associated standards-aligned curricula, will be developed and refined using participatory, design-based research techniques, in partnership with four Austin, TX teachers serving ~300 students from a variety of socio-economic settings.  A curricular framework called Argument Driven Computational Thinking and two associated assessment tools - the Performance Assessment of Computational Thinking and the Computing Attitudes Test - will be developed and validated.  Quantitative and qualitative analysis of videotaped classroom instructional activities, student artifacts, and computer-use logs will be used to document the effectiveness and broad utility of this new model for integrating chemistry and computing.  A post-doctoral fellow and two graduate students will be trained through this project."

Integrating computer science into the United States schools is one of the most significant changes for K-12 public education in decades. The New York City (NYC) CS4All initiative is a leader in this educational reform and serves as a model for other cities and states. One aspect of the NYC efforts is to integrate computer science concepts across disciplines. A challenge with this approach is helping non-computer science teachers, and their students, in assessing if they have met computer science learning goals. This project seeks to create a method to measure this learning through an interactive technology-enhanced assessment system that will provide formative feedback to students and teachers.  This project will address core research questions about how to provide ongoing assessment of student computer science (CS) learning that: (a) provides useful feedback to teachers and students; (b) is appealing for students to engage with; and (c) can be used with a wide diversity of curricula that integrate CS and STEM domains. The tool will be open-sourced and made available to approximately 600 students during the project, with an eye to serve over 100,000 diverse and low-income NYC middle school students, and eventually to other districts across the U.S. In addition, the project will provide insight on research and design in areas as diverse as assessment, CS education curricula, and educational game design. <br/><br/>This project addresses the nationwide need for a validated instrument that provides formative feedback on student progress with diverse computer science curricula. The is a three-year project to design, develop, and conduct research with a validated system of formative assessment for middle school computational thinking that would meet NYC's needs and create opportunities for broader impacts nationwide. Building on research-based approaches, including stealth assessment and evidence-centered design (ECD) of assessments, this project incorporates a range of performance tasks on the topic of Data and Analysis as outlined in the K-12 CS framework. Students will engage in a construction environment and formative feedback on student knowledge and performance will be generated from their interactions. Using participatory design methods, the project will engage stakeholders with designing tasks and reports that best meet teachers' and students' needs. The project will be piloted and then implemented in schools using varied CS curricula throughout NYC. The research will provide empirical data on how integration of formative assessment with adoption of varied CS curriculum can enable districts to meet the needs of a diverse student population. Furthermore, adopting an iterative design process steeped in participatory methods will allow for the generation of theory-driven design principles around how students and teachers from diverse schools and neighborhoods encounter core CS constructs from a variety of CS curricula."

In addition, contemporary STEM careers and research show increased emphasis in the workforce on the need to understand, and to be able to use computing and have computational thinking skills. Moreover, the National Research Council Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) outlined important epistemic practices of science regarding computing that was intended to guide STEM instruction. However, for a myriad of reasons, institutions like K-12 education have not kept up-to-date with integrating the necessary skills development needed for STEM careers. Further, K-12 teachers need assistance in developing and using effective, evidence-based practices for integrating computing and/or computer science into their STEM practice, such as modeling, data analysis, systems and computational thinking. This proposed research project will study the development of computational thinking competencies through the process called ""computation inquiry"" related to geoscience instruction at the middle and high school level, and will study the effects of an innovative authoring tool that will provide teachers with the ability to develop and modify curricula. The project advances the objectives of the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program by seeking to enhance knowledge on new appproaches to integrating computing into STEM teaching and learning. The PI's will work directly with teachers in deriving models of STEM+C curriculum that will assist teachers in designing their own integrated course(s). Special emphasis will be focused on culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Partners include the Technology Access Foundation (TAF) and the TAF Academy of Middle and High Schools with 15 teachers and 300 students. Other partners include the University of Washington Institute for Science + Math Education, and Inverness Research as the external evaluator. <br/>               <br/>This project is based upon the use of project-based learning and the use of the next generation of science standards (NGSS). The PI will add computational inquiry with computational thinking as a strategy to develop curricula. Their research plan focuses on how students and teachers adapt to the integration of computational elements into STEM courses and how each learns and expands the use of computation. Their broad research questions are: How do students develop computational competencies and learn science concepts through computational STEM project investigations involving the practices of modeling, analyzing data, and programming?; How do students' images of science and science identities shift through engagement in computational project-based investigations in science?; How does knowledge of computation lead to new interests and learning pathways related to computational inquiry in STEM for students?; How do teachers in STEM education-focused schools learn to integrate a focus on computational inquiry into their project-based instructional approaches?;How do STEM professionals involved with curriculum co-design support teacher professional learning and integration of a computational focus in curriculum?; How do STEM professionals learn about youth mentoring and project-based learning approaches to the teaching of STEM topics through working with students on STEM projects? Methodologies include: Qualitative coding of student artifacts and interviews; cognitive assessments; ethnographic co-design experiences and design-based research of mentoring experiences."

The content of the projects includes electricity, conductive materials, programming and computational thinking. This project builds on significant work already underway in which e-textiles have been used in out-of-class situations and are beginning the transition to classroom use. The primary implementation activity will be providing professional development to teachers about computational thinking and e-textiles. The project includes scaling up to a large number of teachers. It also includes rural schools in the region of the university. The research and development plan includes collaboration between education faculty and computer science and engineering faculty. As a STEM+C project it nicely integrates computational thinking within the context of science classrooms and presents a model for instruction that could apply to other topics. The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains; integration of STEM in computer science; and broadening participation in computer science. Investments are made in critical areas of pedagogy, pre-service and in-service teacher professional development.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to create and deploy e-textile projects for classroom use in middle and high school science classrooms for electronics concepts.  The plan also includes designing professional development for teachers about the computational thinking concepts and the e-textiles projects. The mixed methods research design will collect qualitative artifacts and journal reflections from teachers regarding classroom implementation and quantitative data in the form of observation instruments and survey results. The student-level research questions focus on students' engagement, computing interest, sense of self-concept, and learning gains in electricity concepts. The teacher-level questions examine instructional practices teachers use in implementation of e-textiles projects in science classes. These questions employ both treatment and comparison groups. Data collection includes surveys of students' interest and self-concept as well as students' knowledge assessments. The teacher-level question examines instructional practices using classroom observations with the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol, computational thinking frameworks, teacher reflections, artifacts from classroom implementation, and semi-structured interviews."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This travel grant focuses on broadening participation in STEM learning and advancing scholarship and practice related to Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR).  In PPSR, members of the public participate voluntarily in scientific processes, addressing real-world problems in ways that may include formulating research questions, conducting scientific experiments, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, making new discoveries, developing technologies and applications, and solving complex problems. Currently, participation in many PPSR projects does not often reflect the full range diversity in the nation. The Citizen Science Association (CSA), an organization that seeks to support the rigorous and ethical practice of citizen science--a form of PPSR--across a broad range of issues and communities, brings together PPSR practioners and scholars biennially. The CSA conference, to be held March 13-17, 2019, in Raleigh, North Carolina, will build networks and capacities to support scholarship and practice across the full range of citizen science and across diverse populations. <br/><br/>This travel grant supports 75 participants, 25 local and 50 national, from groups underrepresented in STEM, who are actively engaged in community-based environmental science and have not previously attended a CSA conference. Community-based environmental science projects, which often occur in minority communities, are increasingly relying on PPSR approaches, including engaging public participants in STEM learning through technology and the development of data literacies. Through this travel grant, the 2019 CSA conference will bring together the expertise and experiences of practioners and scholars from citizen science and community-based environmental science projects. The conference will facilitate four days of interactions and mutual learning with significant time for iterative reflection and active discussion to make the sessions personally relevant and meaningful. This intentionally allows for identifying areas of both commonalities and tensions across citizen science and community-based environmental science projects, with time to work through various approaches and issues with colleagues for greater learning. The interactions should allow for meaningful discussion of goals, theory, methods, recruitment and retention and other aspects of projects that make a difference in the success of projects.  The structure of the conference includes panels, presentations, poster sessions, and discussion to increase the quality and extent of PPSR and community-based environmental science practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These have been highly successful in terms of audiences reached and project evaluations that indicate their impact on learning.  Less well understood is  how the unique attributes of giant screen films (e.g.,  ""immersion"" and ""presence"") affect learners in ways that differ from other film formats.  This integrated research and media project will contribute to that knowledge base. Project deliverables will include a giant screen film that tells the story of the discovery of biological mimicry (the critical proof for natural selection and in turn, evolution) through the life story of Henry Bates and his travels through the Amazon rainforest more than 150 years ago; 2D dome, and 2D flat format versions; live interactive science demonstrations and educational resources; and workshops for ISE professionals.  The film and the related outreach via science centers, social media, and the web are expected to reach large public audiences; workshops and web resources will reach ISE professionals nationally.  A strategy for reaching underrepresented audiences through science museums and partnerships with educational societies is a part of the broadening participation effort.<br/><br/>Building on results of an NSF-funded workshop in which researchers, evaluators, and filmmakers began to develop a research agenda to provide evidence about giant screen attributes and their impacts on learning, the research component of this project will focus on the differences in learner knowledge among the various film formats, their unique attributes, and whether format plays a role in science interest and science identity.   A   baseline study will be conducted to begin gathering evidence on how each of these formats affects learning.  Data on audience knowledge gains, interest, and science identity will be collected using a novel tablet-based game-like assessment pre-film viewing, immediately post viewing, and in a later follow-up.  These baseline data will inform follow-on research that, over time, can better explain the unique impacts on learning of the giant screen format. <br/><br/>Project partners include the Pacific Science Center, SK Films, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rutgers University, and Arizona State University."

They are exploring the types of inferences that learners draw when they use self-explanation or sketching to explain visual representations in algebra and in biology. Working with middle school students, they are testing five comparisons of student performances on problems in those domains. They are examining the mechanisms underlying the success of these two interventions alone and in combination for mathematics and science problems to determine whether the two mechanisms are redundant or complementary. They are examining the nature of the inferences that are prompted by the two techniques and examining the differences in the ways that students with higher spatial ability use the strategies. They follow the performances of the students in a second year on other tasks using similar strategies to examine the how student sketching and self-explanation skills relate to long-term science and math learning. <br/><br/>Three groups of participants are completing individual computer-based sessions that include measures of spatial abilities, working memory, motivation for drawing and spatial tasks, and solving a series of math and science problems using sketching and/or self-explanation. Student performance on the problems are analyzed in terms of the pretest measures. One group of 200 students is being studied longitudinally in 6th through 8th grades to understand changes over time in the reasons why sketching and self-explanation are effective. A second group of 200 8th graders complete the measures in the first year of the project to provide a cross-sectional age comparison. A new group of 6th graders are being audiotaped while solving the problems in the 2nd year of the project in order to understand cognitive processes in finer-level detail. Analyses include cross-sectional t tests, regression models, longitudinal growth curve modeling, and analyses of verbal protocols from the audiotaped sessions. Research activities include developing low- and high spatial math and science problems and a coding scheme for the many different types of inferences. Three doctoral students are trained over the course of the project in school-based research, collection of verbal protocol data, coding, and data analysis. The team consists of experienced psychology researchers, with an expert advisory board providing an annual evaluation. <br/><br/>The products of the research are the low- and high-spatial problem sets, inference coding scheme, and scholarly papers reporting the results of the research. In addition to 600 participating students, the math and science teachers of those students are involved in summer work assisting with coding the student work. The project has an impact on teachers' use of self-explanation and/or sketching at many levels--from elementary through graduate education. The findings help point teachers towards when and with whom to use sketching and/or self-explanation, which leads to better learning in science and math."

Clearly, they are under-represented in the realm of contemporary STEM subjects often because they are geographically isolated and cannot travel to cities where there are Science and Museum Centers for informal education opportunities. As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This award will, in a collaborative effort within the community, bring STEM activities to selected communities in Arizona. Among the initial activities, there will be a STEM festival highlighting aspects of the community and its assets in an effort to gather support and begin to give perspective on identity for an extended effort of longevity. Further, these communities will be networked to facilitate discussion and to enhance effectiveness. <br/><br/>This project will develop STEM activities and STEM learning within a selected community by giving the community and its residents identity and opportunities for youth development and career choices. The selected communities in Arizona represent a diverse group that includes Native Americans and Latinos. In collaboration with community residents, a designed plan will be established that satisfies the needs and opportunities that can be derived from the extant community assets whether it is mining, tourism, or government facilities. Evaluation efforts are set to determine what the key features and methodologies are that facilitate STEM knowledge acquisition for each rural community. This project represents seminal and foundational work in the area of rural informal STEM education. Researchers will explore the following questions: 1) understanding how rural communities currently perceive, access, and engage in informal science learning, and the extent to which they identify themselves and/or their community in relation to science; and 2) the extent to which relevant, place-based networks can increase public awareness of local STEM assets, resources, and opportunities, and foster a science-related identity at both the personal and community level. These data will be compared to data on other rural community projects in the AISL portfolio. The partners in this effort include the Arizona Science Center, community leaders from four rural regions in Arizona, Arizona State University, and the Center of Science and Industry."

With over five hundred federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States, there is much to learn and understand. This Culturally Responsive Indigenous Science project seeks to advance this knowledge base through research and by catalyzing new approaches to Indigenous science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (ISTEM) learning. Using an ISTEM focused model, the project will develop, test, and implement a culturally responsive land-based curriculum that integrates Western science, multimodal technologies and digital tools, and Native American tribal knowledge, cultures and languages to investigate and address local environmental science and sustainability concerns. While Indigenous STEM teaching and learning as constructs have existed for many years, the rigorous research design and extensive integration of multimodal technologies as platforms for scientific inquiry, data management, knowledge dissemination and curation are innovative and timely. Few, if any, Design and Development projects in the current DRK-12 portfolio explore similar work. Therefore, the broader impacts of this project are poised to not only contribute to the DRK-12 portfolio but also advance knowledge in Indigenous STEM education and science education, more broadly. <br/><br/>Over a three year period, hundreds of Native American students (grades 4-9) in tribal schools located in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho will engage in the project. Each year, approximately 60-80 students (grades 7-9), with some returning students, will also participate in enrichment activities and in years 1-3, in the residential summer experience at Washington State University. A qualitative, quasi-experimental design-based study will be conducted to address three salient research questions: (a) What are the impacts of culturally responsive and land education-based ISTEM curriculum and technology on Native American student engagement, efficacy and achievement in school? (b) What types of professional development activities foster teacher efficacy and improve teacher learning and teaching of ISTEM in classrooms? and (c) How can ISTEM foster greater family and community engagement in schools and in Tribal Communities?  Data will be collected through interviews, surveys, and or questionnaires from participating students, teachers, and Tribal members. Consistent with Indigenous methodologies, focus group interviews (talking circles) will also be facilitated after ISTEM community expositions and engagement activities to capture community impacts. Formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by the Learning and Performance Research Center (LPRC) at Washington State University, an independent entity of the University with extensive expertise in project evaluation. A broad range of dissemination activities will be employed to achieve maximum impacts, including the use of the Plateau People's Web Portal, a digital tool designed to help Native communities to manage, circulate, and curate their digital materials using their own cultural protocols, language and social systems. This regional collaboration includes partnerships with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (Oregon), Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Washington), and the Coeur D'Alene Tribe (Idaho). <br/><br/>The project is supported by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Readiness through Integrative Science and Engineering (RISE) is a late stage design and development project that will build upon the results of an earlier NSF-funded design and development study in which a co-construction process for curriculum development was designed by a team of education researchers with a small group of Head Start educators and parent leaders. In this phase, the design team will be expanded to include Classroom Coaches and Community Experts to enable implementation and assessment of the RISE model in a larger sample of Head Start classrooms. In this current phase, an iterative design process will further develop the science, technology, and engineering curricular materials as well continue to refine supports for teachers to access families' funds of knowledge related to science, technology, and engineering in order to build on children's prior knowledge as home-school connections. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve school readiness for culturally and linguistically diverse, urban-residing children from low-income families who tend to be underrepresented in curriculum development studies even though they are most at-risk for later school adjustment difficulties. The focus on science, technology, and engineering will address a gap in early STEM education.<br/><br/>The proposed group-randomized design, consisting of 90 teachers/classrooms (45 RISE/45 Control), will allow for assessment of the impact of a 2-year RISE intervention compared with a no-intervention control group. Year 1 will consist of recruitment, induction, and training of Classroom Coaches and Community Experts in the full RISE model, as well as preparation of integrative curricular materials and resources. In Year 2, participating teachers will implement the RISE curriculum approach supported by Classroom Coaches and Community Experts; data on teacher practice, classroom quality, and implementation fidelity will be collected, and these formative assessments will inform redesign and any refinements for Year 3. During Year 2, project-specific measures of learning for science, technology, and engineering concepts and skills will also be tested and refined. In Year 3, pre-post data on teachers (as in Year 2) as well as on 10 randomly selected children in each classroom (N = 900) will be collected. When child outcomes are assessed, multilevel modeling will be used to account for nesting of children in classrooms. In addition, several moderators will be examined in final summative analyses (e.g., teacher education, part or full-day classroom, parent demographics, implementation fidelity). At the end of this project, all materials will be finalized and the RISE co-construction approach will be ready for scale-up and replication studies in other communities."

The current demand for computer scientists far outweighs the current number of students pursuing computer science (CS) degrees, and those students include very few women and girls, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals from low-income families. The investigators of this study hypothesize that enabling youth from groups who are underrepresented in STEM with the opportunity to program satellites to collect data for investigations of their own design, in a supportive and collaborative environment, is a powerful motivator of learning and interest in science and computer programming careers.  The Nanosatellites and East Bay Rocket Scientists (NEARS) project will develop and study a model that includes 1) engaging youth in designing and conducting locally-relevant scientific investigations that use programmable sensors on earth and on nanosatellites in low-earth orbit; 2) supporting youth leadership skills and contributions to their communities' awareness about locally-relevant issues; and 3) providing youth and their families with opportunities to learn about STEM careers and engage with STEM professionals. Research activities will be carried out in three urban settings-- an alternative career academy school, an after-school program, and summer camps at Lawrence Hall of Science-- that serve high school-aged youth and young adults from underserved communities of the East San Francisco Bay area. A collaborative team of learning scientists at the Lawrence Hall of Science, STEM professionals from ArduSat, and facilitators from the local communities served will work together to design, develop, test, and refine the activities and instructional materials for effective use in different educational contexts. If promising, the activities, instructional materials, and facilitator guides developed through this project would be used in several ongoing programs at the Hall and could be adopted by others seeking to provide similar experiences for youth in their communities. <br/><br/>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by exploring unique opportunities for youth in underserved communities to conduct scientific investigations that feature programming nanosatellites. The Nanosatellites and East Bay Rocket Scientists (NEARS) will develop, implement, and study a model to engage urban youth in grades 9-12 in science and computer programming. The project will develop a progression of inquiry-based student investigations that align with the Next Generation Science Standards and supportive pedagogies that, together, will facilitate youth in participating in STEM and improving their perceptions of and competencies in STEM. The team will iteratively develop, pilot, and refine the activities and materials in each of the three contexts. Ninety students will participate in the research activities over three years. Data sources for research include student work products, video-recorded observations, pre-post surveys, pre-post computational thinking assessments, and case study interviews. Outcome measures include participants' science investigation and discourse practices; STEM fascination, value, and competency beliefs; computer science competencies; career awareness; descriptions of self, particularly with regarding to STEM; and engagement in the project activities. The research seeks to understand how participation in NEARS affects student outcomes; how students, their experiences, and their outcomes vary across the different learning settings and enactments; and what is needed to support project sustainability in each setting. Major outcomes will include 1) educational resources and research that support the effective use of Arduino-controlled nanosatellites in education; 2) understandings of whether and how elements of this contextualized Arduino programming lead to interest in CS; 3) information that will support others in the development of sustainable programming for urban youth; and 4) rich case study descriptions of individuals' pathways to STEM. Research and development products will be shared widely with research, education, and industry communities and include local and national dissemination through social media, partner networks, conference presentations, and research publications."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This collaborative project involving Ohio Northern University, Ohio State University, and Olathe Northwest High School will develop curricular activities and assessment guidance for K-12 science and engineering educators who seek to incorporate engineering design content into their biology, chemistry, and physics classes. This work is important because students' limited exposure to engineering activities can negatively impact their decisions to enroll in STEM courses and to pursue engineering careers. Further, many states are adopting or considering adopting the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a set of classroom standards which integrate engineering content into traditional science disciplines. While high school teachers under these standards are expected to incorporate the cross-cutting engineering content into their courses, they generally receive little high-quality support for doing so. If successful, the project could provide a powerful model of how to support busy and resource-constrained STEM teachers, and create broader student interest in STEM careers.<br/> <br/>Drawing from best practices on instructional design, the project's main objectives are to: (1) design, field-test, and evaluate the impact of 12 NGSS-aligned, engineering problem-framing design activities on students enrolled in grades 9-12 science courses and (2) design and conduct high-quality, sustained professional development that fosters participating high school science teachers' ability to deploy the NGSS concepts-linked activities. Data sources include student design artifacts, video of classroom instruction, and surveys assessing student and teacher attitudes toward engineering, student design self-efficacy and teacher self-efficacy for teaching engineering content. These data will be analyzed to determine what teachers learned from the professional development activities, how those activities informed their teaching and in turn, how students' engagement with the engineering activities relates to their engineering design skills and attitudes. In terms of intellectual merit, the project aims to develop a learning progression of students' engineering design problem-framing skills by characterizing any observed change in students' design work and attitudes over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will partner with middle school science teachers from two local school corporations, STEM university faculty members and undergraduate engineering students, and university-based outreach coordinators from a minorities engineering program, the office of future engineers, and women in engineering program. Through this combined effort, both school corporations that serve underserved, culturally diverse, and socioeconomically disadvantaged students in rural communities; will have broad-based support for engaging 36 teachers and 3000 students in integrated life science with engineering design.

Global society requires citizens and a workforce that are literate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but many U.S. students remain ill prepared in these areas. At the same time, the children who fill U.S. classrooms increasingly speak a non-English home language, with the highest concentration in the early grades. Many young children are also at risk for lack of school readiness in language, literacy, mathematics, and science due to family background factors. Educational efforts to offset early risk factors can be successful, with clear links between high quality early learning experiences and later academic outcomes. SciMath-DLL will help teachers provide effective mathematics and science learning experiences for their students. Early educational support is critical to assure that all students, regardless of socioeconomic or linguistic background, learn the STEM content required to become science and mathematics literate. Converging lines of research suggest that participation in sustained mathematics and science learning activities could enhance the school readiness of preschool dual language learners. Positive effects of combining science inquiry with supports for English-language learning have been identified for older students. For preschoolers, sustained science and math learning opportunities enhance language and pre-literacy skills for children learning one language. Mathematics skills and science knowledge also predict later mathematics, science, and reading achievement. What has not been studied is the extent to which rich science and mathematics experiences in preschool lead to better mathematics and science readiness and improved language skills for preschool DLLs. Because the preschool teaching force is not prepared to support STEM learning or to provide effective supports for DLLs, professional development to improve knowledge and practice in these areas is required before children's learning outcomes can be improved.<br/><br/>SciMath-DLL is an innovative preschool professional development (PD) model that integrates supports for DLLs with high quality science and mathematics instructional offerings. It engages teachers with workshops, classroom-based coaching, and professional learning communities. Development and research activities incorporate cycles of design-expert review-enactment- analysis-redesign; collaboration between researcher-educator teams at all project stages; use of multiple kinds of data and data sources to establish claims; and more traditional, experimental methodologies. Based on initial evidence of promise, the SciMath-DLL project will expand PD offerings to include web-based materials, making the PD more flexible for use in a range of educational settings and training circumstances. An efficacy study will be completed to examine the potential of the SciMath-DLL resources, model, and tools to generate positive effects on teacher attitudes, knowledge, and practice for early mathematics and science and on children's readiness in these domains in settings that serve children learning two languages. By creating a suite of tools that can be used under differing educational circumstances to improve professional knowledge, skill, and practice around STEM, the project increases the number of teachers who are prepared to support children as STEM learners and, thus, the number of children who can be supported as STEM learners."

The fundamental purpose of this project is to support teacher practice and professional learning around oral scientific argumentation in order to improve the quality of this practice in classrooms. To achieve this purpose, the project will examine the validity of a new technology-based formative assessment tool for classroom argumentation--""Diagnosing the Argumentation Levels of Groups"" (DiALoG)--for which psychometric validation work has been conducted in a laboratory setting. The DiALoG assessment tool allows teachers to document classroom talk and display scores across multiple dimensions--both intrapersonal and interpersonal--for formative assessment purposes. The project will work with 6th-8th grade science teachers to monitor and support argumentation through real-time formative assessment data generated by the DiALoG instrument. DiALoG will be used in conjunction with ""Amplify Science"", a Lawrence Hall of Science-developed curriculum that incorporates the science practice of engaging in argument from evidence, and a suite of newly developed Responsive Mini-Lessons (RMLs), which consist of 20-30 minute instructional strategies designed to assist teachers to provide feedback to students' thinking and follow-up to argumentation episodes that the DiALoG tool identifies in need of further support. The study will allow the refinement and expansion of DiALoG and evaluation of its impact on teacher pedagogical content knowledge and formative assessment practices in widespread classroom use.<br/><br/>The project will address two specific research questions: (1) How can DiALoG be refined to provide a formative assessment tool for oral argumentation that is reliable, practical, and useful in middle school classrooms?; and (2) How does the use of DiALoG affect teacher formative assessment practices around evidence-based argumentation, when implementing science units designed to support oral argumentation? In order to answer these questions, the project will conduct a randomized control trial with 100 teachers: 50 will teach argumentation-focused curriculum with DiALoG, 50 will teach the same curriculum without DiALoG. Both control and treatment teachers will receive all digital and physical materials needed to teach three Amplify Science curriculum units. Treatment teachers will be provided also with the most recent version of DiALoG, including the linked RMLs, as well as support materials for using DiALoG with the Amplify curriculum. A subgroup of focus teachers (5 from the treatment group, and 5 from the control group) will be the subject of additional data collection and analysis. Three focus lessons, in which students are engaging in small-group or whole-class oral argumentation, will be selected from each of the three Amplify Science curricular units. Teacher measures for the randomized control trial will include validated instruments, such as (a) a pre- and post-assessment of teacher pedagogical content knowledge; (b) post-lesson and post-unit surveys in which teachers will self-report on their formative assessment practices; and (c) video recordings of selected lessons in the focus classrooms. In order to observe potential differences in formative assessment practices between treatment and control, protocols will be used to analyze the video recordings of focus classrooms, including (a) Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol; (b) Assessment of Scientific Argumentation inside the Classroom; and (c) Formative Assessment for Teachers and Students. The key outcome of this work will be a research-informed and field-tested prototype to improve the quality of teaching and learning argumentation in middle school science classrooms usable in different learning environments."

Meeting this expectation requires teachers to move beyond traditional routines of practice to become adaptive experts who can adjust their teaching to maximize learning in varied classroom situations. A teacher who has adaptive expertise is defined as someone who can self-assess and strategically adjust decision-making before, during and after teaching episodes. To become adaptive experts, teachers must understand the foundational ways that scientific knowledge is advanced and develop knowledge of, and practices related to, using argument, language, and dialogical environments--individually and collectively--as tools for learning science. To effectively use these tools requires teachers to shift from viewing science teaching as the transfer or replication of knowledge through routines of practices to one in which students are participants in a more cognitively based approach to learning. How teachers develop adaptive expertise for NGSS-aligned learning environments is still little understood. This project will examine the complex nature of the relationship between these learning tools and teacher orientation that enables teachers to develop adaptive expertise over the course of a multi-year professional development program.<br/><br/>The project will work with 150 Grade 3-5 teachers in Iowa and Alabama to implement a three-year professional development program to assist teachers develop adaptive expertise.

Project data will include teachers' implementation of the approach, their understanding of science argument, and their shifting epistemic orientation. The project will examine selected case studies of teachers to better understand the variations in development of adaptive expertise. The project outcome will be a model of adaptive expertise that can be used by in-service and pre-service educators to advance teacher practices towards adaptive expertise.

Reflective of the new Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012), the model addresses key crosscutting concepts (e.g., cause and effect: mechanism and explanation), disciplinary core ideas (e.g., engineering design, and links among engineering and society), and scientific and engineering practices (e.g., identifying a problem, and designing solutions for technology-related problems in local school or community environments). It builds on theoretical perspectives and empirical foundations, including situated learning, engineering design cognition,and children's resources and funds of knowledge, including cultural and linguistic diversity. The study integrates research and education plans that investigate the short-term impact of the model on 90 novice teachers' learning through their pre-service coursework and practice teaching, and its longer-term impact on a subset of 48 of those teachers as they begin their first year of in-service teaching.<br/><br/><br/>The study employs a design-based research that addresses three phases: (a) a development phase to create a community-based engineering module and assessment instruments; (b) an iterative implementation phase that includes three cycles of community-based engineering experiences with three cohorts of novice teachers; and (c) a synthesis phase focused on generating cumulative findings and recommendations. Its hypothesis is that incorporating community-based engineering into elementary teacher education will enhance novice urban elementary teachers' engineering design competency, understanding of engineering and scientific practices, and ability to identify and respond to student ideas and practices in science and engineering. This hypothesis guides four research questions: (1) How do novice urban elementary teachers' engineering design abilities evolve during community-based engineering experiences?; (2) How do the teachers' understandings of engineering and scientific practices evolve during community-based engineering experiences?; (3) How do the teachers' engineering abilities and understandings of engineering and scientific practices impact how they identify and respond to students' science and engineering ideas and practices?; and (4) Does participating in extended professional development on community-based engineering impact the teachers' (a) understandings of engineering and scientific practices, (b) abilities to identify and respond to student thinking, or (c) incorporation of science/engineering lessons into their first two years of teaching? The research plan articulates a descriptive thread and an experimental thread. The descriptive research thread addresses the first three research questions, inclusive of three constructs: (a) novice urban elementary teachers' engineering design abilities, (b) their understandings of practices of science and engineering, and (c) their abilities to identify and respond to students' ideas and practices.

The proposal will address the critical issue of developing children's identification with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, and will respond to the existing limited knowledge about the development of STEM identities through conversations, particularly among very young children from underserved and underrepresented populations. The study will be based on the premise that individuals who develop STEM interest and identify with STEM at a young age tend to pursue STEM-related careers more so than individuals who develop these interests later in life. Research on the topic suggests that after exploring a variety of childhood informal STEM learning experiences, such as playing with electronics, taking care of animals, and joining after-school science clubs, talking about science and consuming science-related media were the only predictors of STEM identity. The study will investigate whether STEM-related conversations outside of school with friends and family during formative years (i.e., 5 -9 years old) predict their STEM identity later in life and their STEM-career choices. The goals of the project will be : (1) To develop an understanding of the features and context of conversations that support STEM identity development in both majority and Hispanic/Latino populations; and (2) To translate the research outcomes into informal STEM learning practices that contribute to young people's perceptions of STEM fields in their future.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals, the work will address the following research questions: (1) What is the content, context, and structure of STEM-related conversations with friends and family that youth ages 5-9 participate in?; (2) How do these conversation features (i.e., content, context, structure) relate to the development of youth's STEM interests, sense of recognition as STEM people, and self-identification with STEM?; (3) How do the cultural values and science talk experiences of Hispanic/Latino youth shape conversation features related to youth's STEM interests, sense of recognition as STEM people, and self-identification with STEM in comparison to non-Hispanic/Latino youth?; and (4) Does professional development for informal STEM learning educators that focuses on encouraging youth to engage in STEM-related conversations with friends and family positively contribute to youth's STEM interest, sense of recognition, and self-identification with STEM? To address these questions, the study will adopt a qualitative research approach that applies phenomenological strategies in research design, data collection, and analysis to allow for exploration of the meaning of lived experiences in social and cultural contexts. Participants will include elementary-age students (ages 5-9; n = 50) from socially, culturally, and linguistically diverse backgrounds, enrolled in summer science camps in the greater Miami area that intentionally solicit the participation of children and families who would not typically participate in these kinds of programs due to socioeconomic and cultural barriers. To inform the development of interview protocols in terms of the kinds of childhood talk that leave a long-term impact on students, including the kinds of talk experiences remembered by students who choose or persist towards a STEM career in college; the project will also recruit first- and second-year college students as participants. Data gathering, and interpretation strategies will include surveys with college students (n=32) and interviews (n = 16), as well as recorded and coded semi-structured interviews with early-grade students (n= 50). Broad coding of the content, context, and structure of STEM-related conversations will be further subdivided into sub-codes to identify patterns using qualitative analytical strategies. The outcomes of this research will constitute a theoretical framework and models that can guide the development of both professionals and programmatic activities at informal learning institutions, particularly around scaffolding participation in STEM through science talk.

Integrating computer science into the United States schools is one of the most significant changes for K-12 public education in decades. The New York City (NYC) CS4All initiative is a leader in this educational reform and serves as a model for other cities and states. One aspect of the NYC efforts is to integrate computer science concepts across disciplines. A challenge with this approach is helping non-computer science teachers, and their students, in assessing if they have met computer science learning goals. This project seeks to create a method to measure this learning through an interactive technology-enhanced assessment system that will provide formative feedback to students and teachers.  This project will address core research questions about how to provide ongoing assessment of student computer science (CS) learning that: (a) provides useful feedback to teachers and students; (b) is appealing for students to engage with; and (c) can be used with a wide diversity of curricula that integrate CS and STEM domains. The tool will be open-sourced and made available to approximately 600 students during the project, with an eye to serve over 100,000 diverse and low-income NYC middle school students, and eventually to other districts across the U.S. In addition, the project will provide insight on research and design in areas as diverse as assessment, CS education curricula, and educational game design. <br/><br/>This project addresses the nationwide need for a validated instrument that provides formative feedback on student progress with diverse computer science curricula. The is a three-year project to design, develop, and conduct research with a validated system of formative assessment for middle school computational thinking that would meet NYC's needs and create opportunities for broader impacts nationwide. Building on research-based approaches, including stealth assessment and evidence-centered design (ECD) of assessments, this project incorporates a range of performance tasks on the topic of Data and Analysis as outlined in the K-12 CS framework. Students will engage in a construction environment and formative feedback on student knowledge and performance will be generated from their interactions. Using participatory design methods, the project will engage stakeholders with designing tasks and reports that best meet teachers' and students' needs. The project will be piloted and then implemented in schools using varied CS curricula throughout NYC. The research will provide empirical data on how integration of formative assessment with adoption of varied CS curriculum can enable districts to meet the needs of a diverse student population. Furthermore, adopting an iterative design process steeped in participatory methods will allow for the generation of theory-driven design principles around how students and teachers from diverse schools and neighborhoods encounter core CS constructs from a variety of CS curricula."

The primary goals of this Full Scale Development project are to broaden access to and participation in environmental science, strengthen partnerships between CZS, Eden Place, and UIC, and gain insights into the 'ecosystemic' learning model which promotes scientific literacy and agency in the community. The project targets a low-resource community with a minority audience while the secondary audience is informal science learning organizations and researchers who will advance research in informal learning. <br/><br/>The theoretical framework for the project design draws on conservation psychology, informal science learning, civic ecology education, and urban science education to create an ecosystematic, geographically centered approach. The deliverables include research, curriculum, and engaging hands-on programs for youth, families, adults, and teachers, reaching both in-school and out-of-school audiences, in addition to the SCIENCES Implementation Network. Three potential curriculum themes to be explored are water conservation and protection, pollinators for healthy ecosystems, and community resilience to climate change. The SCIENCES project offers a comprehensive suite of engaging programs for community audiences. For example, the year-long Zoo Adventure Passport (ZAP) program for families includes hands-on experiments and field trips, while project-based learning experiences enable teens to create wetlands, design interpretive signage, and develop associated public programming. School-based programs include professional development for teachers on the Great Lakes ecosystem and invasive species. Existing programs that have been previously evaluated and demonstrated to show learning impacts will be adapted and modified to meet the goals of the ecosystemic learning model by providing multiple learning opportunities. New learning resources will also be created to support the content themes and provide continuity. The result will be a comprehensive approach that ensures deep community engagement by individuals, families, and organizations, with cohesiveness provided by the overarching content themes which broaden access to STEM learning resources and leverages partnerships.<br/><br/>The project includes both a research and evaluation plan. The primary research question to be addressed is:  How does a large informal science learning institution work with a community-based organization to support environmental scientific literacy and agency at all levels of the community? A sociocultural framework will be used for this mixed-methods case study research. Study participants include community leaders, youth, parents, teachers, and staff from Eden Place. The case study sample will include 20 focal individuals drawn from the participant groups and approximately 300 survey participants. Case study data will be triangulated with evaluation data and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. By examining changes from the baseline following the implementation of the community programs, the findings may provide insight on agency and science literacy among community members.  The comprehensive, mixed-methods evaluation plan employs a quasi-experimental design and incorporates front-end, formative, and summative evaluation components. The evaluation questions address the quality of the processes and products, access to environmental science learning opportunities, environmental science literacy, sustainability, and barriers to implementation. <br/><br/>An extensive dissemination plan is proposed with a dual emphasis on meeting stakeholders' needs at multiple levels.  The evaluation and research teams will emphasize publication in peer reviewed journals and presentations at conferences for informal science education professionals. Findings will be shared with the Fuller Park community stakeholders using creative methods such as one-page research briefs written in layperson's language, videos, and recorded interviews with participants. The local project Advisory Board will also be actively involved in the dissemination of findings to community constituents. The SCIENCES National Amplification Network will be created and work collaboratively with the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Metropolitan Green Spaces Alliance to disseminate the model. Collectively, the activities and deliverables outlined in this proposal will advance the discovery of sustainable models of community-based learning while the research will advance the understanding of informal learning support for science literacy and agency."

This issue points at the pressing need to prepare science and mathematics teachers to open up their instructional strategies to students' diverse ideas and their sense-making approaches. This CAREER award aims to study the construct of ""epistemic empathy"" and examine how it can be cultivated in science and mathematics teacher education, how it functions to promote responsive teaching, and how it shapes learners' engagement in the classroom. In the context of this project, epistemic empathy is defined as the act of understanding and appreciating another's cognitive and emotional experience within an epistemic activity aimed at the construction, communication, and critique of knowledge. Through epistemic empathy, teachers take learners' perspectives and identify with their sense-making experiences in service of fostering their inquiries.<br/><br/>The study's five research questions will be: (1) Do the ways in which pre-service teachers display epistemic empathy change throughout a course aimed at promoting attention to and knowledge about learners' varied ways of knowing in science and mathematics? (2) How do the teaching domain and teaching context influence how teachers express epistemic empathy, and the concerns and tensions they report around empathizing with learners' thinking and emotions? (3) How does epistemic empathy shape the ways in which teachers understand and reflect on their roles, goals, and priorities as science or mathematics teachers? (4) How does epistemic empathy shape teachers' responsiveness to student thinking and emotions during instruction? and (5) How does teachers' epistemic empathy influence how students orient and respond to each other's thinking in science and mathematics classrooms? To address these questions, the project will conduct a series of design-based research studies working with science and mathematics pre-service and in-service K-12 teachers (n=140) to design, implement, and analyze ways to elicit and cultivate their epistemic empathy. Further, the project will explore how epistemic empathy shapes teachers' views of their roles, goals, and priorities as science or mathematics teachers and how it influences their enactment of responsive teaching practices. The project will also examine the influence of teachers' epistemic empathy on student engagement, and the ways students attend and respond to each other's epistemic experiences in the classroom. Data collection strategies will include video and audio recording of teacher education and professional development sessions; teachers' work within those sessions, such as their responses to a pre- and post-video assessment tasks and their written analyses of different videos of student inquiry; teachers' interviews; and videos from the teachers' own instruction, as well as teachers' reflections on these videos in stimulated recall interviews. These data will be analyzed using both qualitative methods, such as discourse analysis, interaction analysis; and quantitative methods, such as blind coding and  descriptive statistics. The project's outcomes will be: (1) an instructional model that targets epistemic empathy as a pedagogical resource for teachers, with exemplars of activities and tasks aimed at developing their responsiveness to and ways of leveraging learners' meaning-making processes; (2) local theory of teachers' learning to epistemically empathize with learners in science and mathematics; and (3) empirical descriptions of how epistemic empathy functions to guide and shape teachers' responsiveness and students' engagement. An advisory board will provide feedback on the project's progress, as well as formative and summative evaluation.<br/><br/>This is a CAREER award in the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program. The DRK-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current models often focus primarily on students working with computers at earlier ages and teachers as the primary instructor. This project presents an alternative model that allows for schools and districts to implement CS/CT education for all students, particularly girls, by focusing on ""unplugged"" gameplay in school libraries as a foundation for CS/CT lessons with computers in classrooms. The objectives of this project are to iteratively codesign, develop, and pilot instructional materials and sequences that deeply integrate CS/CT using board games and coding into upper elementary school classrooms in ways that specifically broaden participation, especially from girls. A unique feature of the approach is that while the project will focus on 5th grade classrooms and practicing teachers, the team will also mobilize a critical but often under-appreciated resource within the district: the school library and its librarians. The partnership between Utah State University and Cache County School District will involve developing custom computer science board games. Students will play these games in the school library and have synthesis lessons when they return to class to build upon the computational ideas encountered. The tabletop games will be in the library for students to play before and after school as well as during recesses; they will also be available for checkout for students to take home. The project team will also build digital versions of the board games that students will then revise, remix, and share using block-based coding in Scratch. This will enable students to further collaboratively explore, build upon, and code CT ideas first foregrounded and experienced in the board game. This project will also yield design principles related to tabletop board games for computer science, classroom and school library collaborations, and how coding skills can be better developed through encounters with both unplugged and screen-based media.  Results of the project will include a model of how a lower threshold form of computer science education can be successfully enacted at the elementary school level coupled with evidence on how it impacts student learning and interest. More generally, findings will contribute to a wide range of efforts intended to bring more girls into computer science. It raises awareness of the many design and collaboration activities that researchers can pursue with respect to a new model of unplugged computing with librarians who play key roles in their schools.<br/><br/>The project builds upon the field's growing understanding of how gameplay experiences that go beyond the screen can be utilized in service of computer science education. The two years of design and research partnership to build tabletop board games, curriculum materials, and digital instantiations will advance knowledge about the effective design of resources for computer science education. It also utilizes school libraries and organic tabletop gameplay activities that are popular among youth in those spaces, thus drawing upon existing youth interests and the expertise and skill of educational professionals who are often overlooked in discussions about new curricula. The games will emphasize computational concepts such as algorithmic thinking, sequences, loops, decomposition, and iteration foundational aspects of computational thinking. Research questions that have been jointly developed and will be addressed throughout this project include examining how transitioning from tabletops to screens 1) can be effectively implemented by school librarians and classroom teachers in ways that support classroom activities around computational thinking and coding, and 2) can increase interest in and learning of coding and computer science for elementary students, especially girls. The project will collect data including: (1) transcripts and audio or video recordings of clinical interviews, interviews, focus groups, and game sessions; (2) surveys characterizing participant interest; and (3) observation notes of the game play. The project team will analyze the qualitative data using open and axial coding techniques to establish design scenarios and cases. The project will use regression models to understand changes in students' interests, intrinsic and career, with gender as a potentially mediating covariate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project incorporates the principles underlying the Next Generation Science Standards with a focus on promoting students' scientific sense-making, comprehension and communication of scientific discourse, and productive use of language. It articulates theory and practice related to the teaching of science content and the development of English language and literacy, and provides teachers with models of integrated practice in video cases and curriculum units. To test the efficacy of the study, a longitudinal, mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study is conducted at four institutions: the University of California-Santa Cruz, Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas-San Antonio. <br/><br/>The three research questions are: (1) What is the impact of the project's pre-service teacher education program on novice secondary science teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and practice from the pre-service program into the second year of teaching?; (2) What is the relationship between science method instructors' fidelity of implementation of the project's practices and novice teachers' outcomes (knowledge, beliefs, and practice)?; and (3) What is the relationship between novice teachers' implementation of project-promoted practices and their students' learning? To answer these questions, the project collects and analyzes quantitative and qualitative data on novice teachers (85 treatment group and 85 control group) over three years utilizing surveys, interviews, observations, and student assessment instruments. Teachers' beliefs and knowledge about teaching science to ELLs are measured using the project-developed Science Teaching Survey, which provides quantitative scores based on a Likert-type scale, and the science teacher interview protocol to provide qualitative data, including the contextual factors affecting implementation of project-promoted practices. Classroom observations are captured through qualitative field notes and the Classroom Observation Rubric--a systematic project-developed observation instrument that measures implementation of the practices. Student learning outcomes are measured using (a) the Woodcock-Muoz Language Survey (students' proficiency at applying listening, reading, writing, and comprehension abilities); (b) the Literacy in Science Assessment (students' productive use of language in authentic science literacy tasks); (c) the Scientific Sense-Making Assessment (how students make sense of core science ideas through scientific and engineering practices); and (d) appropriate state standardized assessments. In addition, the Opportunity to Learn Survey gauges students' perceptions of implementation of literacy integration, motivation in class, and identity as readers. <br/><br/>Project outcomes are: (a) a research-based and field-tested model for pre-service secondary science teacher education, including resources for science methods courses instructors and pre-service teachers; and (b) valid and reliable instrumentation usable in similar research and development environments."

Since many of these acts of racial microaggression come from administrators, colleagues, and peers, this project will serve as an important step in directly addressing this issue. The research will (a) identify actions or activities that might be precursors of or lead to microaggressions; (b) seek to better understand why the microaggresssors might be aware or unaware of their acts; and (c) collect data about approaches and policies that have been used by colleagues and administrators to minimize racial microaggressions.<br/><br/>The Critical Race Theory will be used as the lens to frame the study. Questionnaires, an Implicit Attitude Test, interviews, and other archival documents will be used as sources of data for this study. These sources will allow the exploration of gaps in the literature where prior research focused almost exclusively on faculty and students of color within science education rather than on performers of microaggressions. This investment will support a risky, yet, potentially transformative venue for theory development relative to reducing racial microaggressions in science education.

The E-STITCH (Elementary STEM Teaching Integrating Technology and Computing Holistically) project is a curriculum and professional development project designed to facilitate meaningful scientific inquiry with computer science in grades 3-6. Based on recent national findings that about half of students who intended to pursue science-related careers in 6th grade ultimately earned STEM-related baccalaureate degrees, in contrast to only one third of their counterparts who planned on non-science related careers, students' early educational experiences influence potential future career choices based on both academic preparation and the formulation of personal identities compatible with STEM pursuits. Therefore, the project's significance and importance lies in its creation of meaningful and integrated STEM learning experiences that will provide foundational knowledge, prepare young students to become informed citizens, and stimulate their interest in and awareness of professional opportunities in STEM prior to completing elementary school. Further, increased student interest and engagement with STEM by 6th grade is a critical predictor of later commitment to entering the STEM workforce. The professional development of teachers within a single geographic region will additionally provide the opportunity to establish an extended learning community of professionals that can sustain continued development and support of instruction enhanced by e-textiles, especially significant in rural districts where teachers are often geographically dispersed and may not be able to come together as a professional learning community on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Project E-STITCH focuses on integrating e-textiles technologies to develop innovative technology experiences for elementary teachers and students, especially in rural areas. E-STITCH is a curriculum development project designed to facilitate meaningful scientific inquiry related to physical science with technology (both hardware and software applications and development). The project targets teachers and their students in grades 3-6 by developing new curriculum to engage students in computing activities that are integrated with multiple content areas appropriate for a multi-subject classroom. These projects provide the opportunity to use new technologies as tools for scientific inquiry and data modeling while leveraging connections to students' out-of-school interests and cultural backgrounds. Project E-STITCH will meaningfully engage 30 teachers and 1,800 students in a novel approach to integrating computing into science and engineering activities in diverse rural communities across the state of Utah, including rural White, Latinx and Native American populations. E-STITCH engages students directly with STEM content and skills through the design, prototyping, and creation of objects that are relevant to their interests and needs. E-textiles incorporate elements of embedded computing for controlling the behavior of fabric artifacts. In contrast to conventional wires and breadboards, these artifacts are created using novel materials such as conductive fibers or conductive Velcro, sensors for light, sound, and pressure, and actuators such as LEDs and speakers, in addition to traditional aspects of fabric crafts. By sewing circuits using these materials to produce wearable items (e.g. t-shirts, backpacks), students engage in designing solutions that are intellectually rigorous as well as culturally and personally meaningful. The data collected will contribute to understanding of how to integrate Making effectively into K-12 core content areas in ways that align with standards and address the needs of diverse learners at scale. Because Project E-STITCH uses non-traditional materials to create new and meaningful points of entry into STEM learning through inquiry, it will engage students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental purpose of this project is to support teacher practice and professional learning around oral scientific argumentation in order to improve the quality of this practice in classrooms. To achieve this purpose, the project will examine the validity of a new technology-based formative assessment tool for classroom argumentation--""Diagnosing the Argumentation Levels of Groups"" (DiALoG)--for which psychometric validation work has been conducted in a laboratory setting. The DiALoG assessment tool allows teachers to document classroom talk and display scores across multiple dimensions--both intrapersonal and interpersonal--for formative assessment purposes. The project will work with 6th-8th grade science teachers to monitor and support argumentation through real-time formative assessment data generated by the DiALoG instrument. DiALoG will be used in conjunction with ""Amplify Science"", a Lawrence Hall of Science-developed curriculum that incorporates the science practice of engaging in argument from evidence, and a suite of newly developed Responsive Mini-Lessons (RMLs), which consist of 20-30 minute instructional strategies designed to assist teachers to provide feedback to students' thinking and follow-up to argumentation episodes that the DiALoG tool identifies in need of further support. The study will allow the refinement and expansion of DiALoG and evaluation of its impact on teacher pedagogical content knowledge and formative assessment practices in widespread classroom use.<br/><br/>The project will address two specific research questions: (1) How can DiALoG be refined to provide a formative assessment tool for oral argumentation that is reliable, practical, and useful in middle school classrooms?; and (2) How does the use of DiALoG affect teacher formative assessment practices around evidence-based argumentation, when implementing science units designed to support oral argumentation? In order to answer these questions, the project will conduct a randomized control trial with 100 teachers: 50 will teach argumentation-focused curriculum with DiALoG, 50 will teach the same curriculum without DiALoG. Both control and treatment teachers will receive all digital and physical materials needed to teach three Amplify Science curriculum units. Treatment teachers will be provided also with the most recent version of DiALoG, including the linked RMLs, as well as support materials for using DiALoG with the Amplify curriculum. A subgroup of focus teachers (5 from the treatment group, and 5 from the control group) will be the subject of additional data collection and analysis. Three focus lessons, in which students are engaging in small-group or whole-class oral argumentation, will be selected from each of the three Amplify Science curricular units. Teacher measures for the randomized control trial will include validated instruments, such as (a) a pre- and post-assessment of teacher pedagogical content knowledge; (b) post-lesson and post-unit surveys in which teachers will self-report on their formative assessment practices; and (c) video recordings of selected lessons in the focus classrooms. In order to observe potential differences in formative assessment practices between treatment and control, protocols will be used to analyze the video recordings of focus classrooms, including (a) Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol; (b) Assessment of Scientific Argumentation inside the Classroom; and (c) Formative Assessment for Teachers and Students. The key outcome of this work will be a research-informed and field-tested prototype to improve the quality of teaching and learning argumentation in middle school science classrooms usable in different learning environments."

The TI model involves teachers in three core experiences: 1) a research experience for teachers, 2) materials adaptation, and 3) an action research project. The original program was implemented with high school chemistry teachers at Grand Valley State University (GVSU), and was shown to result in significant increases, with large effect sizes, in teachers' understanding of science inquiry and quality of instruction, and in science achievement of those teachers' students. The scale-up and further testing would involve adding physics, biology and geology at Grand Valley State University, and implementing the program at Miami University (MU) with chemistry teachers. Three research questions will be studied: <br/>1) How do the three TI core experiences influence in-service high school science teachers' (i) understanding of the nature of science; (ii) attitudes and beliefs about inquiry instruction; and (iii) classroom instructional methods in the derivatives of the TI model? <br/>2) How does teacher participation in TI affect students' process skills (scientific reasoning and metacognition) and conceptual understanding of science in the derivatives of the TI model? <br/>3) What are the challenges and solutions related to implementing TI in science disciplines beyond chemistry and in other regions? <br/><br/>The research design is quasi-experimental and longitudinal, incorporating implementation with research, and using quantitative and qualitative methods blended in a design research framework. A total of 54 middle and high school science teachers are being recruited for the study. The TI group is completing the TI program (N = 27; 15 at GVSU; 12 at MU) while the comparison group (same sizes and locations) is not. The comparison group is matched according to individual characteristics and school demographics. All teachers are being studied, along with their students, for 4 years (pre-program, post-RET, post-MA, post-AR/post-program). TI teachers are taking 15 credits of graduate level science courses over three years, including summers. Courses include a graduate seminar focused on preparing for the research experience, the research experience in a faculty member's science lab during the summer, application of research to teaching, action research project development, adaptation and evaluation of inquiry-focused curricula, and interpretation and analysis of classroom data from action research. Consistent feedback from professional development, teachers, and evaluation, including the previous implementation, contributes to a design-based approach. Teacher factors being studied include nature of science, inquiry teaching knowledge and beliefs, and quality of inquiry instruction. Student factors being studied include scientific reasoning; metacognition, self-efficacy, and learning processes in science; and content knowledge and conceptual understanding. Only established quantitative and qualitative instruments are being used. Quantitative analysis includes between-group comparisons by year on post-tests, with pre-tests as covariates, and multi-level models with students nested with teachers, and teachers within sites, with the teacher level as the primary unit of change. Trends over time between the treatment and comparison groups are being examined. The evaluation is using a combination of pre/post causal comparative quantitative measures and relevant qualitative data from project leaders and participants, as well as from the comparison group, to provide formative and summative evaluation input.<br/><br/>Outcomes of the project include documentation and understanding of the impacts on science teachers' instruction and student outcomes of research experiences for teachers when they are supported by materials adaptation and action research, and an understanding of what it takes to scale the model to different science disciplines and a different site. The project is also producing a website of instructional materials for middle and secondary science."

Shallow problem solving skills are skills that apply to a specific instance of a problem but do not generalize to similar problems.  This research project will study how deep understanding of STEM concepts can be supported in a computer based learning environment - specifically genetics problem solving.  The learning environment will support both genetics process-modeling understanding and genetics abductive reasoning - that is reasoning from empirical data to the genetic processes that could generate that data.  Both process modeling and abductive reasoning models are relevant to many STEM domains. Developing computer-based activities that support learning of genomic analysis, and understanding robust student knowledge of this topic promise to yield large societal benefits by improving STEM learning.<br/><br/>The research will combine cognitive modeling and educational data mining to develop and evaluate a multi-component model of the depth of student learning during problem solving.  The proposed research addresses a well-documented shortcoming in student problem solving, observed across STEM domains: some students develop shallow problem-solving knowledge that they have difficulty applying in new situations.  The proposed research will develop a multi-component, yet parsimonious, model of students' depth of knowledge that predicts individual differences in direct transfer of knowledge to, and future learning of, successive topics in a problem-solving curriculum. This research will occur in the domain of modern genetics problem solving. Genetics is a fundamental, unifying theme of biology and is viewed as one of the most challenging topics in biology by students and instructors, in part because it relies heavily on problem solving. Genetics problem solving relies on two types of knowledge: genetic process-modeling knowledge, and abductive reasoning skills - reasoning backwards from empirical data to the genetic processes that generated the data. The proposed research will focus on student understanding of genomic pathway analysis, a foundational topic linking classic Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics that is key to understanding advances in 21st century biology. This project will model 4 components of students' genetics knowledge: (1) verbal declarative knowledge of gene action; (2) genetics process modeling knowledge; (3) abductive reasoning skill; and (4) metacognitive skills. The research will examine hypotheses about how to integrate these measures into a unified model that predicts individual differences in future learning processes; that is, which components of student knowledge affect the intercept (direct transfer), and which affect the rate, of students' learning functions in successive topics across the curriculum. The project will employ the Genetics Cognitive Tutor, an intelligent learning environment that provides students step-by-step support as needed in solving problems. The project leverages existing problem-solving modules, will build some additional modules, and will bring the accompanying instructional text for all modules on-line to incorporate student reading-time measures into a robust learning model. Recent student modeling efforts have yielded preliminary, promising results that lay the foundation for a complete model: (1) models that infer students' knowledge from step-by-step accuracy in basic problem-solving reliably predict both basic problem-solving posttest performance, and robust learning posttest measures (transfer and preparation for future learning; (2) models of students' metacognitive skills more accurately predict these robust learning measures; and (3) models of automaticity accurately predict ""shallow"" learning. This project will integrate these components and declarative knowledge measures into a comprehensive framework that models students' robust learning in problem-solving and predicts not only time-slices of student performance on robust-learning tests, but predicts individual differences in entire learning functions as students complete successive problem-solving curriculum units."

This research project leverages ongoing longitudinal research to investigate whether, and if so how, youth from ages 10 to 15 in a diverse, under-resourced urban community become interested and engaged in STEM. The project addresses a global issue; fewer youth choose to major in scientific fields or take science coursework at high school or university levels. These declining numbers result in fewer STEM professionals and fewer scientifically literate citizens who are able to function successfully in an increasingly scientific and technological society. These declines are observed for youth as a whole, but are most pronounced for girls and particular non-white ethnic minorities. Data collected from youth in this community of study, including non-white ethnic minorities, mirrors this decline. NSF funding will support a five-year systematic and systemic process in which project researchers work collaboratively with existing informal and formal educational partners (e.g., museums, libraries, afterschool providers, schools) to develop sets of customized, connected, and coordinated learning interventions, in and out of school, for youth with different backgrounds, needs, and interests, all with the goal of averting or dampening this decline of STEM interest and participation during early adolescence. In addition to new research and community STEM networks, this project will result in a Community Toolkit that includes research instruments and documentation of network-building strategies for use by other researchers and practitioners nationally and internationally. <br/><br/>This mixed methods exploratory study has two distinct but interrelated populations - youth and educators from across informal and formal institutions. To develop a clearer understanding of the factors that influence youths' STEM interest development over time, particularly among three youth STEM Interest Profiles identified in a secondary analysis (1-Dislike Math, 2-Like all STEM, 3-Dislike all STEM), the design combines surveys with in-depth interviews and observations. To study educators and institutions, researchers will combine interviews, focus groups, and observations to better understand factors that influence community-wide, data-driven approaches to supporting youth interest development. Research will be conducted in three phases with the goal of community-level change in youth STEM interest and participation. In Phase 1 (Years 1 & 2) four educational partners will develop interventions for a 6th and 7th grade youth cohort that will be iteratively refined through a design-based approach. Educational partners and researchers will meet to review and discuss interest and participation data and use these data to select content, as well as plan activities and strategies within their programs (using a simplified form of conjecture mapping). By Phase 2 (Years 3 & 4) four additional partners will be included, more closely modeling the complex system of the community. With support from researchers support and existing partners, new educational partners will similarly review and discuss data, using these to select content, as well as plan activities consistent with program goals and strategies. Additional interventions will be implemented by the new partners and further assessed and refined with a new 6th and 7th grade cohort, along with the existing interventions of the first four partners. In Phase 3 (Year 5) data will be collected on pre-post community-level changes in STEM interest and participation and the perceived effectiveness of this approach for youth. These data will inform future studies."

The system will use data about land use to automatically construct map-based simulations of any area in the United States. Users will be able to choose from a range of environmental and economic issues to include in these models. The system will create simulations that ask students to change to patterns of land use -- for example, increasing land zoned for housing, or open land, or industrial development -- to try to meet environmental and social goals. As a result, students will be able to learn about the interaction of environmental and economic issues relevant to their own city, town, neighborhood, or region. These map-based simulations will be incorporated into an existing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education tool, Land Science, in which learners work in a fictional planning office to study how zoning affects economic and environmental issues in a community. Research has shown that Land Science is mode effective when learners are exploring issues in an area near their home, and the current study will investigate how and why local simulations improve environmental science learning. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which supports work to enhance learning in informal environments by funding innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team will build, test, and deploy a toolkit that will allow informal STEM educators and developers of informal STEM programming to easily adapt an existing environmental science learning environment, which consists of a place-based virtual internship in urban planning and ecology, to their local contexts, learning objectives, and learner populations. Land Science is a virtual internship in which young people explore the environmental and socio-economic impacts of land-use decisions. To do so, they play the role of interns at an urban planning firm developing a new land-use proposal for the city of Lowell, Massachusetts: they read reports, virtually visit sites, determine stakeholder priorities, and use a geographic information system (GIS) model to evaluate the socio-economic and environmental impacts of land-use choices. No one plan can satisfy all stakeholders, so learners must compromise to create an effective plan and justify their decisions. Land Science has been shown to improve civic engagement, interest in eco-social issues, and understanding of scientific models, but it is most effective when the location of the virtual internship is in or near the learners' home town. To improve the accessibility and impact of this effective learning intervention, the interdisciplinary research team, which includes learning scientists, land-use experts, and informal STEM educators, will develop a Local Environmental Modeling toolkit, which will allow educators to change the location of the simulation and the stakeholder groups, zoning codes, and environmental and socio-economic indicators included in the land-use model. The system will ensure that the model produced is functional, realistic, and appropriately complex. The localized versions of Land Science produced by informal STEM educators will be used in a range of contexts and locations, allowing the research team to study the effects of an online, place-based learning intervention on environmental science learning, STEM interest and motivation, and civic engagement."

For this project, contentious science is science for which there are ""substantive ethical concerns that may lead scientists as well as the broader public to call the value of scientific inquiry into question and inspire policy responses that hinder rather than advance scientific progress."" The project focuses on two specific fields of contentious science: stem cell science and bio-nanotechnology. This work has potential to inform training of future scientists for research in contentious fields and, thus, to contribute to long-term efforts to stimulate innovative research in these emerging areas of research. <br/><br/>The project's activities will include two phases of research.  In the first phase, the PI will conduct interview studies with graduate students and early-career scientists.  The purpose of this phase is to refine a theoretical framework about the factors that may influence graduate students' decisions to enter, stay in, or leave research programs in contentious science.  The findings will inform the second phase, a three-wave panel survey of graduate students.  This panel survey will provide data on graduate students in contentious science fields, compared to students in similar but non-contentious research areas.  Results will be analyzed to understand the relative influence of factors that influence career choices and research decisions.  The extent to which ethical controversy disproportionately affects the graduate education and career development of women and underrepresented minorities will also be addressed."

As such, the incoherence of state and local science systems is well-documented in the research literature, as are the ways that incoherence makes system-level improvements difficult to attain. This project will investigate the steps state level science educators and policymakers might take to help build coherent systems of science education around a common vision where curriculum, instruction, and assessment align. It will address the problem of incoherence by testing strategies to better understand the conditions under which state systems of science education afford all students with opportunities to meet the challenging new vision for science education presented in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012). A network of state teams and researchers will work together to bring a unique blend of expertise to collaborative co-design processes and to conducting rigorous implementation research using formative assessment as the vehicle for promoting advancement in educational leadership practice. The project will examine two main forms of coherence important in systems relevant to state leaders' roles in their respective systems: (1) vertical coherence, which looks at the degree to which there is a shared understanding of the goals for science learning and consensus about the purposes and uses of assessment: and (2) horizontal coherence, which focuses on the alignment of curriculum, instruction, and assessment policies and practices with the new vision for science education.<br/><br/>The project will employ design-based implementation research (DBIR) using a mixed methods approach to build foundational knowledge and theory about how a network of states can support implementation of ambitious new standards and promote coherence across systems of science education.  The project will collect data through surveys, focus groups, key informant interviews, and case studies from multiple levels of the states' education systems including state level officials and classroom teachers. Researchers and state teams will serve as co-researchers through participatory research that builds local capacity for conducting systematic inquiry into educators' needs and an information network to enable cross-state comparisons of perceived challenges to coherence. Outcomes from the project will include foundational knowledge about methods, tools, and strategies for building knowledge and theory in science education. In turn, these outcomes will benefit society by supporting the development of a shared vision for K-12 science education among participating states, experts, researchers, and the broader science education stakeholder community. In addition, the project will benefit the students in the states by increasing their knowledge of science and engineering in ways that will allow them to engage in public discussions and it will benefit the design of solutions to expand diversity in STEM fields."

The project will involve emerging agricultural technologies like transparent soil (a recent discovery which is a hydrogel that behaves like soil), a near-peer and college-focused mentoring model, and interaction with scientists. The youth will learn to build and code Raspberry Pis (small and affordable computers that students can use to learn programming) to share their data with agronomists and plant scientists. The outcome goal for this work is to prepare youth to enter a post-secondary institution with strong research skills through experience in conducting careful, rigorous scientific research. Throughout the three-year project, youth will be engaged in the same type of scientific research that is occurring at the university level. Specifically, youth will learn: (i) to build the tools (sensors connected to Raspberry Pi and sensors connected to the Internet of Things web infrastructure provided by IBM Watson software system) they will use to collect their data, (ii) to carry out a rigorous scientific investigation (identifying questions, as well as finding and minimizing experimental containments, and determining dependent vs. independent variables), and (iii) to develop models and potential explanations based on their data in collaboration with practicing scientists. The program will recruit low-income youth, and youth from populations underrepresented in science from high schools in Boston Public Schools and support them in learning core scientific research skills and engage them in building the tools they will use to conduct their more complex experiments. The program will not only build the capacity of the youth participants to make potential scientific discoveries, but through the mentoring program youth leaders and mentors will become role models to youth in their community.<br/><br/>There are four major aspects of the proposed work. First, youth will engage with cutting edge technologies being used in scientific research labs. Second, a diverse team of collaborators will be assembled consisting of STEM career development experts, Youth Mentoring experts, Scientists, and Science Educators to design the proposed work. Third, the program is a unique combination of three synergistic components: (1) a near-peer mentoring approach, (2) STEM learning, and (3) youth purpose and career development. Unlike other out-of-school STEM programs, this program will not only support the learning of STEM concepts, but it will do so by taking youth on a personal journey designed to help them discover the relevance of STEM skills for fulfilling future career aspirations, as well as preparing them for post-secondary education. Fourth, the data that youth will share with practicing scientists has the potential to help answer important questions in plant science regarding how plants, particularly their root structures, react to environmental stressors. The research approach provides an opportunity to examine how such constructs as purpose, critical consciousness, and work volition impact youths' intentions to pursue a STEM field. To date, these important constructs have not been seriously considered in STEM career development. Thus, the research on the impact of near-peer mentoring and youths' adaptability and intentionality to explore, pursue, and stay in STEM fields will provide the ITEST community with an evidence-based model integrating near-peer mentoring, scientific research, and STEM career development to elucidate how youth may successfully pursue a STEM field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The findings will address important questions about what kinds of supports different children need to learn CS, as well as who benefits from CS instruction, and how. The results will fill gaps in understanding how to create systems change in schools and school districts that can lead to CS integration for all students. These gaps include the process through which prioritization and integration occurs in districts and the kinds of support and resources that are needed for teachers. The findings will also contribute to an understanding of how to reduce unconscious bias about who is interested in and would be good at computer science. Finally, the activities will fill an important gap in understanding how to engage parents at all socioeconomic levels in educational reform. This project will produce instructional materials designed to build on the interests and strengths of girls, Hispanic/Latino students, and English language learners in elementary and middle school. The activities will offer opportunities to learn CS and CT, and will build the capacity of educators to test and revise strategies to integrate CS into classrooms in a way that fully engages a range of learners. The activities are also designed to leverage community resources and increase public engagement, with a focus on parents who are traditionally not involved in education reform, in CS education for all students. <br/><br/>The project will address a high-level research question: How do we reduce the disparity in students' access to quality opportunities to learn CS/CT and ongoing support to persist in CS? The activities will include teacher professional development, the creation of instructional materials and brief interventions to integrate inclusive CS into elementary and middle school classrooms, a district wide CS committee to identify needs and resources to build a network of support to boost the capacity of all schools to integrate CS into classes, the development of a system to leverage parent and community resources to support and sustain CS education, and data collection and analysis to monitor learning progressions and systems change in order to strengthen the efforts to build a CS pathway for all students. The research methods will involve working in a researcher-practitioner partnership to finalize measures, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and interpret the findings and use them in an iterative process to inform next steps. Outcomes to be measured include teachers' CS capacity and behavior, students' CS knowledge and interest, teachers' and parents' unconscious bias, a networked improvement community to leverage resources and provide support, parent and community engagement, data- and research-driven decision making, and a contribution to the field of broadening participation in CS. An external advisor will monitor the project's Theory of Change, the integrity of the research design and methods, and the development of the research-practice partnership."

Outcomes include the modules, tested and revised; strategies for transfer of learning embedded in the modules; and a compendium of green jobs, explicitly related to the modules. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) Program is a joint effort between the Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) and Directorate Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE). Reflecting the increasing role of computational approaches in learning across the STEM disciplines, STEM+C supports research and development efforts that integrate computing within one or more STEM disciplines and/or integrate STEM learning in computer science; 2) advance multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches for integrating computing in STEM in and out of school, and 3) build capacity in K-12 computing education through foundational research and focused teacher preparation<br/><br/>The project is a full design and development project in the learning strand of DRK-12. The goal is to enhance transfer of knowledge in mathematics and science via sustainability tasks with an emphasis on mathematical and scientific practices. The research questions focus on how conceptual representations and the modules support students' learning and especially transfer to novel problems. The project design integrates the research with the curriculum development. It includes a mixed methods data collection and analysis from teachers and students (e.g., interviews, content exams, focus groups, implementation logs). Assessment of student work includes both short, focused problems in the content area and longer project-based tasks providing a range of assessments of student learning. The investigators will develop a rubric for scoring student work on the tasks. The curriculum design process includes iterations of the modules over time with feedback from teachers and using data collected from the implementation."

For example, students' math motivation peaks in high school yet 45% of 10th graders who express interest in pursuing a STEM career lose that interest by the end of high school. Adolescents with minimal math and science high school coursework are extremely unlikely to either try or be able to enter STEM college majors and careers.  To change these trends, it is necessary to understand how best to support high school students in math and science. Moreover, to increase the diversity of the nation's STEM workforce, it is important to understand whether motivational processes work differently for youth who reside at the intersections of demographic characteristics such as gender, race and social class. The current body of research on social factors that contribute to high school students' STEM motivation is largely based on studies of Caucasian families. This project exemplifies the Education and Human Resources Core Research program's commitment to fundamental research on learning in STEM that combines theory, techniques, and perspectives from a wide range of disciplines and contexts.  <br/><br/>Drawing from expectancy-value motivational theory, social positioning theories and feminist intersectionality theory, this project has five aims that center around understanding the role that parents play in students' STEM trajectories. Family support matters because it has been recognized as an important factor in maintaining student interest. To achieve its aims, the project team will analyze four waves of data from the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS). The HSLS includes a nationally representative sample of 21,444 9th graders. It offers a large, rich sample to study intersectionality as defined by students' simultaneous status on multiple demographic indicators. The data includes longitudinal multi-reporter information on student motivation, outcomes, and parent support in math and science. Students' trajectories will be traced at 9th grade, 11th grade, the fall immediately after high school graduation, and 3 years after high school. The role of other socializing factors such as school and peer experiences are also examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the earliest and most accessible windows into spatial skills is children's block play--building structures with physical blocks. Building with blocks is surprisingly complex, which makes it difficult to characterize in detail how children build structures, why they sometimes struggle, and what can be done to improve their skills. Drawing on traditional observational methods and advancements in computer science, this project creates detailed, robust, and automatic techniques for characterizing children's building behaviors and articulating the different building paths taken by ""novice"" and ""expert"" child builders. Its multidisciplinary approach advances the frontiers of understanding about how people learn, and how they might use their STEM knowledge more effectively. The tools produced by the project will offer new ways to measure spatial skills in formal and informal learning settings, and has the potential to change the way we think about early block-building as a marker for learning. In this way the project reflects NSF's investments in promising developments that build a coherent, cumulative knowledge base, focusing on high-leverage topics.<br/><br/>Spatial skills represent a fundamental aspect of human knowledge, supporting a wide range of cognitive functions including our ability to create and understand 2- and 3-D spatial representations of information. This project focuses on one of the earliest developing yet highly complex spatial skills--block building--which has garnered attention in both cognitive and educational arenas due to its accessibility and adaptability for young children in formal and informal learning contexts. Consistent with the Education and Human Resources Core Research program's mission of supporting fundamental research on learning in STEM that combines theory, techniques, and perspectives from a wide range of disciplines and contexts, the spatial skills coding system developed in this project combines video and motion tracking of children's block building. This will allow researchers to gather and characterize data from much larger numbers of children than ever before, to relate these data on block-building to other academically-relevant skills, and to use the characterization of child ""expert"" performance as instructional input to ""novice"" builders. Its use of traditional cognitive methods along with machine learning techniques to characterize the process of children's block building and how it develops will generate scalable tools that can be used by scientists and educators to characterize, analyze, and promote development of spatial skills in our youngest learners."

Yet still little is known about how to engage students in one of the most central practices of science, theory building. The project will investigate how 8th grade students can engage in scientific theory building, including computatinal thinking, and how theory building can be integrated into their science curriculum. There are many ways scientists approach building theory. In some cases, they begin with data and abstract a relationship in order to more precisely describe it in terms of a mathematical model (i.e., aggregate pattern approach). In other cases, they posit the mechanism for a phenomenon, beginning with assumptions about a system (e.g., its elements and their interactions) and build a computational model that, when run, produces outcomes that can be explored (i.e., individual mechanism approach).  No educational research studies have yet sought to characterize the commonalities and differences of the two approaches. The project will investigate the learning opportunities of each approach to theory building and use these results to create curricular units that integrate the two approaches. The project will contribute to the educational research base and disseminate project research findings for use by science teachers, curriculum developers, and instructional coaches.<br/><br/>The research aims to understand the character of 1) the theories the students produce; 2) the processes by which they produce their theories; and 3) the characteristics of student learning that result. These questions are addressed through lab-based studies that introduce students to phenomena by guiding them to either articulate the aggregate-level pattern seen in data or develop agent-based computational models that represent the mechanism behind the pattern. Findings will inform the design of curricular units that will be tested through design-based research in the third year. These findings will illuminate how the two approaches can be integrated to help students learn about both scientific phenomena and theory-building processes. The research will also extend insight into how the production of different representations affords different learning pathways. Products of the study will inform the development of curricular materials and software. The research will be of practical value by informing general principles for designing and conducting theory-building instruction. The software produced will extend the widely used NetLogo and NetTango platforms to facilitate building theoretical computational models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the strategy of integrating art and science to promote interest, identity, and other STEM-related learning has grown in recent years, this domain is still nascent with respect to a guiding set of best practices.  Through prior work, the team has developed and implemented a set of design principles that incorporate effective practices for broadening participation of girls in science via science-art integration on the topic of the biology, chemistry and optics of ""Colors in Nature."" The continued initiative would impact the ISL field by providing a mechanism for ISL educators in museums, libraries and after-school programs to adopt and implement these STEAM design principles into their work. The team will lead long-term (12-18 months) professional development activities for ISL educators, including: 1) in-person workshops that leverage their four previously developed kits; 2) online, asynchronous learning activities featuring interactive instructional videos around their STEAM design principles; 3) synchronous sessions to debrief content and foster communities of practice; and 4) guided design work around the development or redesign of STEAM activities.  In the first four years of the project, the team will work with four core institutional partners (Sitka Sound Science Center, Sno-Isle Libraries, the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District after-school program, and the Pima County Public Library system) across three states (Alaska, Washington, and Arizona). In the project's later stages, they will disseminate their learning tools to a broad, national audience.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

This project will develop a national infrastructure of state and regional partnerships to scale up The Franklin Institute's proven model of Leap into Science, an outreach program that builds the capacity of children (ages 3-10) and families from underserved communities to participate in science where they live. Leap into Science combines children's science-themed books with hands-on science activities to promote life-long interest and knowledge of science, and does so through partnerships with informal educators at libraries, museums, and other out-of-school time providers. Already field-tested and implemented in 12 cities, Leap into Science will be expanded to 90 new rural and urban communities in 15 states, and it is estimated that this expansion will reach more than 500,000 children and adults as well as 2,700 informal educators over four years. The inclusion of marginalized rural communities will provide new opportunities to evaluate and adapt the program to the unique assets and needs of rural families and communities. <br/><br/>The project will include evaluation and learning research activities. Evaluation will focus on: 1) the formative issues that may arise and modifications that may enhance implementation; and 2) the overall effectiveness and impact of the Leap into Science program as it is scaled across more sites and partners. Learning research will be used to investigate questions organized around how family science interest emerges and develops among 36 participating families across six sites (3 rural, 3 urban). Qualitative methods, including data synthesis and cross-case analysis using constant comparison, will be used to develop multiple case studies that provide insights into the processes and outcomes of interest development as families engage with Leap into Science and a conceptual framework that guides future research. This project involves a partnership between The Franklin Institute (Philadelphia, PA), the National Girls Collaborative Project (Seattle, WA), Education Development Center (Waltham, MA), and the Institute for Learning Innovation (Corvallis, OR)."

This project addresses the challenge of how to prepare undergraduate elementary preservice science teachers to learn methods involved in computational thinking (CT) in order to support integration of CT into their elementary STEM instruction. Such early integration of CT in STEM learning will provide the foundation that young children need in computational thinking when their interests and competencies are being formed. Additionally, early integration of CT in STEM may increase the number and diversity of students interested in enrolling in high school computer science courses (and thus in computer science careers). The first step is to improve the preparation that elementary teachers receive about CT to increase both the quantity and quality of exposure for elementary-aged children. The overall goal of this project, therefore, is to transform elementary school teacher practice by integrating CT strategically and significantly into science instruction for all young learners, thereby promoting a more numerous and more diverse citizenry that is knowledgeable and interested in computing. Findings and materials from this project will be disseminated to a broad group of stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, teacher educators, and K-12 personnel and community.<br/><br/>This project will address the fundamental question, ""What strategies are most effective in integrating computational thinking effectively into elementary preservice teachers' pedagogical preparation experiences in science in order to cultivate and improve access to CT for all students?"" The project team will design, implement, and test pedagogical modules for developing CT in a preservice teachers' science methods pedagogical course. Further, an extracurricular Science Teaching CT Inquiry Group will be designed to enhance and broaden the level of understanding of CT for both teacher interns and their mentor teachers, including how computer applications support the teaching of science and how CT is a necessary science practice for all elementary-aged students. This inquiry group will be led by an interdisciplinary team with a variety of expertise, including computer scientists, science educators, educational technologists, and graduates of the elementary education program (during the 2nd year of the project). Instruction in how to convey to young learners the integral nature of CT for STEM career awareness and readiness will be included throughout the curriculum innovation. Because this study will use a design-based methodology, design and testing of the resources and measures will be conducted cyclically and concurrently. This  program of research will use a rigorous mixed methods research approach to collect both qualitative and quantitative data that will be triangulated to develop and analyze resources, measures, and processes. As such, this project seeks to engage in exploratory, basic research to provide empirical support in developing a set of resources (science methods experiences), tools (a framework for integrating CT in undergraduate science teacher pedagogy education), and measures (assessments for CT understanding and CT STEM career awareness)."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>In this project, SmartCAD: Guiding Engineering Design with Science Simulations, the Concord Consortium (lead), Purdue University, and the University of Virginia investigate how real time formative feedback can be automatically composed from the results of computational analysis of student design artifacts and processes with the envisioned SmartCAD software. Through automatic feedback based on visual analytic science simulations, SmartCAD is able to guide every student at a fine-grained level, allowing teachers to focus on high-level instruction. Considering the ubiquity of CAD software in the workplace and their diffusion into precollege classrooms, this research provides timely results that could motivate the development of an entire genre of CAD-based learning environments and materials to accelerate and scale up K-12 engineering education. The project conducts design-based research on SmartCAD, which supports secondary science and engineering with three embedded computational engines capable of simulating the mechanical, thermal, and solar performance of the built environment. These engines allow SmartCAD to analyze student design artifacts on a scientific basis and provide automatic formative feedback in forms such as numbers, graphs, and visualizations to guide student design processes on an ongoing basis. <br/><br/>The research hypothesis is that appropriate applications of SmartCAD in the classroom results in three learning outcomes: 1) Science knowledge gains as indicated by a deeper understanding of the involved science concepts and their integration at the completion of a design project; 2) Design competency gains as indicated by the increase of iterations, informed design decisions, and systems thinking over time; and 3) Design performance improvements as indicated by a greater chance to succeed in designing a product that meets all the specifications within a given period of time. While measuring these learning outcomes, this project also probes two research questions: 1) What types of feedback from simulations to students are effective in helping them attain the outcomes? and 2) Under what conditions do these types of feedback help students attain the outcomes? To test the research hypothesis and answer the research questions, this project develops three curriculum modules based on the Learning by Design (LBD) Framework to support three selected design challenges: Solar Farms, Green Homes, and Quake-Proof Bridges. This integration of SmartCAD and LBD situate the research in the LBD context and shed light on how SmartCAD can be used to enhance established pedagogical models such as LBD. Research instruments include knowledge integration assessments, data mining, embedded assessments, classroom observations, participant interviews, and student questionnaires. This research is carried out in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Virginia simultaneously, involving more than 2,000 secondary students at a number of socioeconomically diverse schools. Professional development workshops are provided to familiarize teachers with SmartCAD materials and implementation strategies prior to the field tests. An external Critical Review Committee consisting of five engineering education researchers and practitioners oversee and evaluate this project formatively and summative. Project materials and results are disseminated through publications, presentations, partnerships, and the Internet."

The after-school program will engage urban Latino middle school and high school students in activities aimed at developing computational competencies and promoting interests in pursuing computer science related studies and careers.  The project will also engage pre-service teachers in a new professional development model that will include a specialized computer science teaching methods course, and will have them teach computational competencies in the after-school program.    A new 16-month computer science curriculum will be designed and tested for the College and Beyond after-school program sponsored by the Latin American Association.   The curriculum activities will be organized around four themes: Block-Based Programming, Embedded Systems, Game Development, and App(lication) Development.  Students will develop skills in planning, designing, programming, running, and debugging algorithms to solve problems and accomplish tasks. The interactive curriculum will incorporate a variety of learning tools that will provide multiple ways for students to learn and demonstrate their computational competencies.  As students become more familiar with designing algorithms that are efficient, they will also come to appreciate the importance of logical reasoning, creativity, and working within real-world constraints to their designs.  Development of the new curriculum will be guided by input from focus groups that include Latino students, mentors and teachers who work with Latino students, and representatives of industry.  In conjunction with the new curriculum, new instruments will be developed and tested to measure shifts in student motivation, attitudes, and competencies in computational thinking, as well as pre-service teacher aptitude, motivation, and aspirations related to teaching computational competencies.<br/><br/>This is a design and development research project that will iteratively design, develop and test a new curriculum, a set of assessment instruments, and a computer science education methods course for pre-service teachers.  Project participants will include 50 Latino middle school students, 50 Latino high school students, and 16 pre-service STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teachers over a period of 3 years.  Development of the new after-school curriculum will be framed by the skills and dispositions associated with computational thinking as defined by the International Society for Technology in Education and the Computer Science Teachers Association.   The project team will work in partnership with the Latin American Association and the Technology Association of Georgia Education to ensure that the resulting curriculum is culturally relevant to the target population and responsive to the real-world context of the STEM workforce.   The project will consist of three phases: a) resource development; b) resource implementation; and c) pilot testing.  Pilot test quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated measure Analysis of Variance.  It is anticipated that student participants will exhibit improvements in skills, aptitudes, and habits of mind associated with computational and algorithmic thinking, along with increases in motivations and aspirations to pursue studies and careers associated with computing and STEM fields.  The project will also produce new and modified research instruments for measuring these outcomes.  The outcomes of this project will likely have broad impacts on teaching and learning in formal classrooms and out-of-school learning environments, and on our understanding of how to best tailor learning experiences to the cultural contexts of underserved and underrepresented populations."

The project will create real and on-line materials for scientists to convey the excitement, content, and relevance of their own research to public groups whose values, professions, or aesthetic and cultural backgrounds are connected to that research topic.  The project will also foster ways for scientists to understand that members of the public can provide valuable input to science.  Research and evaluation on the development of this innovative public engagement model ""the STEM Ambassador Program (STEMAP)"" will be conducted to provide insights into the effectiveness and extensibility of the STEMAP model.  This approach integrates three existing elements of science engagement that have previously not been linked: design thinking, informal science education communication skills from museum work, and connecting scientists' research with the existing values of particular community groups.  Robust evaluation will enhance effectiveness of in-person and online trainings; research will provide understanding of how different science learning models can be integrated and enhanced for public audiences and for scientists.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.  This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>Science and society need innovative and transformative ways to interact synergistically. Given the deep knowledge and contagious passion for their research, STEM professionals can bring unique assets to directly engage public audiences, especially important the traditionally underserved public groups.  Members of the public in turn have the potential to provide novel ideas, data, and insights to support researchers.  The project's exploratory research will help understand how STEM professionals can broaden participation by themselves engaging unengaged publics with the excitement of science and science knowledge in ways that are congruent with academic rewards. The project team will integrate three existing NSF-funded models: a) Research Ambassador Program, b) Portal to the Public, and c) Design Thinking.  A cadre of faculty and graduate students will be trained in ""STEM Ambassadors"" workshops, in which social scientists and community group representatives will help STEM Ambassadors identify public groups with interests that connect to the scientist's research.  Engagement events will occur in community venues, e.g., churches, factories, and day care centers, etc.  Case studies and evaluation instruments answer research questions about: the role of empathy in the formation and change of identity; relationships between public audiences, mode of engagement, and identity shifts; and motivational drivers for STEM Ambassadors and public audiences. The intellectual merit is the training and evaluating of 50 STEM Ambassadors (via 100 outreach events involving approximately 5000 individuals from community groups); strategies that encourage STEM professionals to engage with underrepresented publics; and insights on how to integrate multiple education models.  STEMAP will disseminate its findings and new resources through the STEMAP website.  In addition, the dissemination efforts will be extended through: collaboration with the NSF-funded PoPNet Expansion Project and the Centers for Science and Mathematics Education (CSMEs); presentations at national science professional organizations, such as the AAAS, as well as through the CAISE Wiki and the National Alliance for Broader Impacts (NABI).  STEMAP will create a process for other NSF PIs to generate, evaluate, and articulate their research and its applications to public groups that lie far outside academia."

The Yale Ciencia Initiative, in collaboration with Ciencia Puerto Rico, working with the Department of Education of Puerto Rico will develop culturally relevant project-based science lesson plans that incorporate the disaster context that can be implemented both inside and outside of the traditional classroom. The project will allow displaced students to continue learning under the guidance of teachers, parents or social workers.  The project will train educators in the use of disaster-related problem-based lessons and assess project implementation and the impact of the lessons. The final outcome of this aim will be a lesson plan template and implementation guidelines for other jurisdictions faced by natural disasters. The project will result in enhanced infrastructure for education by developing tools and implementation guidelines that other jurisdictions may use to develop their own lesson plans in advance of natural disasters, so as to assure continuity of learning.<br/><br/>The project will assess implementation through observations and rubrics, surveys for parents, educators and students, and focus groups with each of these populations. To assess the impact of contextualized PBL lessons, the project will collect survey data, before and after the educational intervention, to measure changes in students' content knowledge, as well as in attitudes that are predictive of engagement in science learning. Results will be compared to matched control groups that receive either the standard curriculum, which are not contextualized to the disaster and that does not include PBL, or a PBL lesson plan that does not incorporate the disaster or the cultural context. At least 30 educators and 200 7th grade students will be exposed during the project period to the contextualized PBL lesson plan. The resulting feasibility analysis will inform other jurisdictions preparing their educational systems for natural disasters and provide evidence for the use of contextualized lesson plans that incorporate PBL in disaster recovery settings. In addition, the project design will advance the field of PBL by allowing investigators to examine the impact of integrating current social/historical contexts to PBL lessons and by examining the relationship between changes in science attitudes and engagement, with changes in learning.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

In alignment with these aims, the STEM + Digital Literacies (STEM+L) project will investigate science fiction as an effective mechanism to attract and immerse adolescents (ages 10-13) from diverse cultural backgrounds in environmental and human health content and socio-scientific issues. This work is particularly novel, as the current knowledge base is limited, and largely addresses the high school level. Therefore, the results of the proposed effort could yield important findings regarding the feasibility of this activity as an effective platform for science learning and engagement for younger students. As such, STEM+L would not only advance knowledge in the field but would also contribute to a growing AISL portfolio on digital literacy and learning. <br/><br/>STEM+L is an early stage Innovations in Development project that will engage thirty middle school students in out of school time experiences. Over a twenty-four-week period, students will work collaboratively in groups in-person and online with their peers and field experts to design, develop, and produce STEM content rich, multimedia science fictions. The in-person learning experiences will take place on the University of Miami campus during the summer and academic year. Culminating activities include student presentations online and at a local Science Fiction Festival. The research component will employ an iterative, design-based approach. Four research questions will be explored: (a) How do students learn science concepts and multimodal digital literacies through participating in the STEM+L Academy? (b) How do students change their views in STEM related subject matter and in pursuing STEM related careers? (c) How do students participate in the STEM+L Academy? (d) How do we best support students' participation and learning of STEM+L in face-to-face and online environments? Data collection methods include video records, student-generated artifacts, online surveys, embedded assessments, interviews, and multimodal reflections. Comparative case analysis and a mixed methods approach will be employed.  A rigorous evaluation will be conducted by a critical external review board.

Once the modules are developed, teachers from across North Carolina come to the Nature Research Center to work on and prepare to use these modules in their classrooms, statewide.<br/><br/>The three core partner school systems conduct summer programs for students tied to the science curriculum and include a series of Students Discover course modules. These students and their families are engaged in additional programing throughout the year.  The students, teachers and parents using the modules will become part of a community of collaborators who collectively help to make new discoveries - whether they are of new species, phenomena or observations - that would otherwise be impossible. <br/><br/>The project also includes a research component that is examining a process for moving innovations from more ideal classroom settings to a variety of schools and community-based settings where conditions for success may be less favorable.  A key aspect for the broader community is the research identifying the conditions and elements of modules and science that best translate to other settings and adapt the approach so as to build on those factors that most effectively alter learning outcomes and spread class to class and region to region. <br/><br/>The project involves scientists in every phase.  Initially, the scientists at North Carolina State University and in the Nature Research Center lead the implementation and development.  As the project develops, it capitalizes on broad interest among faculty in K-12 education to forge many new links between scientists, educators and students.  Those links and the project's modules help students and scientists make new discoveries together."

Focusing on six high-need Southern California school districts, ESCAPE targets grade 3-5 English Language Learners (ELLs) in developing the academic language needed to understand scientific concepts. To address learning challenges posed by difficult scientific vocabulary, the project integrates the arts' more concrete strategies to illustrate the sciences' more abstract concepts, exploiting similarities between these disciplines' shared basis in crosscutting concepts like pattern, cause/effect, scale, proportion, and quantity. The grade 3-5 focus is crucial because comprehension at this level is pivotal to future achievement. Led by University of California-Irvine STEM faculty (with support from UCI's CalTeach preservice science teacher development program), the partnership includes teachers and administrators from the Orange County Department of Education and six school districts, WestEd educational consultants, and the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. ESCAPE expects to increase: 1) teacher content and pedagogical knowledge in Earth, Physical, and Life Science; 2) integration of arts to boost ELL learning; and 3) student achievement on science and language development tests.<br/><br/>Over four years, each of 150 teachers receives 220 hours of team-based professional development in using science kits and illustrating science concepts through the arts. Program effectiveness is measured using a random assignment design. Principals in each of the six districts volunteer their schools for the project; within each district schools are randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Program effects on students' and teachers' science knowledge and achievement are measured by pre- and post-tests for students and teachers. The goal of the research is to measure the effect of the intervention on teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, as well as the effect on student science achievement.  Causal mechanisms are investigated, including how school and teacher characteristics modify the effects as well as differential effects on ELLs and native English speakers, and the mechanisms underlying these differential effects. The quantitative analyses is based on multilevel regression models, with students nested in classrooms (teachers) that are nested in schools, and accounting for a host of control variables. These methods provide unbiased estimates of program effects. Qualitative data include teacher implementation logs, feedback forms, and focus groups.<br/><br/>ESCAPE aims to provide sustainable teacher professional development that increases teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, while overcoming impediments to ELLs' STEM learning. Over the project's five years, 150 teachers will teach ~21,000 students, and ~180 CalTeach preservice teachers will be trained. Among the project's products is an ELL-accessible curriculum for Earth, Physical, and Life Science in grades 3-5 and a video-based online system for training teachers (providing a university Certificate in Teaching Science through the Arts), which will be deployed and tested with CalTeach pre-service teachers and teachers in Southern California school districts. This will assist in the national dissemination of this model for improving teacher and student achievement."

All videos will be screened at a Film Festival open to the general public.<br/><br/>The project goals are to: a) generate and sustain interest in STEM-related fields through collaborative videography projects; b) increase student STEM workforce readiness and awareness through interactions with mentors working in STEM, science communication, and digital technology fields; and c) advance knowledge in STEM education of factors that impact student outcomes.  The project will compare the outcomes of two student engagement models: an intensive one-week summer model, and a school-year model implemented over a period of 6 months.  Research in this project will focus on student outcomes related to career awareness and goals, school engagement and persistence, attitudes toward science and technology, and climate science knowledge.  Outcomes of the two models will be measured, and the moderating effects of demographic factors and the influence of teachers, mentors, peers, parents, and social media will be examined.  Demographic information and data from surveys and assessments administered before and after program implementation will be used to compare three groups: a) participants in the summer model; b) participants in the school-year model; and c) and a demographically matched comparison group.

CPS is experiencing a tiered implementation of the CS graduation requirement in its high schools: the first tier of schools is integrating the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course into their curriculum and a second tier of schools will do so by 2019. A third tier of approximately 40 schools face additional barriers (e.g., lack of resources, qualified teachers, reduced student exposure) and are resisting the transition to CS adoption. The project targets these schools by focusing on integration of computational thinking into the teaching of mathematics and science courses and will test the hypothesis that this effort will provide a 'bridge' to computer science course offerings. The effort will focus on teacher leadership and subsequent teacher development. Several curricula will be tested for integration into existing courses, for example Project GUTS (Growing up thinking scientifically) for supporting computational thinking in science courses and Bootstrap for Algebra. This approach will change school culture and attitudes towards CS and will provide a bridge for third tier schools to achieve sufficient professional development for offering the ECS course. These efforts will ultimately culminate in 100% coverage of the CS graduation requirement across the district. Through documentation and study of this effort, the project will serve as a model for other districts nationwide for integrating computational thinking into the teaching of science and mathematics and how this could support change in school culture and capacity for offering computer science courses. The project addresses core objectives of the STEM+C program to support research advancing a strong and developmental foundation in computing and computational thinking in preK-12 science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning and the applied integration of STEM content in preK-12 computer science education. <br/><br/>In this proposal the research questions involve: 1) understanding whether integration of CS into math and science, coupled with teacher leadership professional development and coaching, can support the formation of a school-level community around computational thinking; 2) understanding how a strong Professional Learning Community (PLC) around computational thinking might facilitate implementation of a CS course; and 3) understanding the extent to which high school students proficiency will be impacted by CS integration. Surveys will provide insight into changes in teacher practice and perceptions. Social networks will be explored. Institutional change will be documented through detailed comparative case studies. Answers to research questions will be attained by examining student learning outcomes, teaching practice, teacher social networks, and professional learning opportunities. The breadth of data gathered through multiple tools will be used to examine the relationship between the approach and student learning outcomes. Case studies of 12 teachers leaders will provide insight into the ways in which teacher interactions influence uptake of CS."

The project's goal is to explain students' learning of four concepts that are part of both mathematics and computer science: variables, expressions, loops and abstraction.  The project will design a middle school computer science course to incorporate the mathematics concepts. It will explore technology-based dynamic representations that are part of an interactive computer-based system. The research results and product development are potentially transformative to mathematics, science, and computer science teaching and learning in light of the expansion of computer science courses nationwide and current national mathematics and science standards. The project has strong potential for impact because it focuses on signature concepts from mathematics and computational thinking that are both areas of overlap and foundational concepts across a range of grade levels and courses. The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains; integration of STEM in computer science; and broadening participation in computer science. Investments are made in critical areas of pedagogy, pre-service and in-service teacher professional development. The ECR program contribution to the funding of this project, emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments in ECR are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Considering the concepts dynamically is a significant and potentially transformative departure from current practice in mathematics and computer science. The research questions examine learning outcomes for students and a theory of action for engaging computational thinking in diverse classrooms. The project will begin by creating assessments of students' conceptual understanding. Then, it will employ a design-based research study for creating technology platforms and activities for students. Finally, it will refine the theory of action for implementing the course. The data collection and analysis includes case studies of students' learning to support the research results and to refine the curriculum materials. Teachers and school district leaders are involved with the design and implementation of the materials.

Stark, cold, and seemingly frozen in time, the top and bottom of the Earth feel other-worldly, completely removed from our everyday existence.  Yet, nothing could be further from the truth. The Arctic and Antarctic exert profound influence over our entire planet.  Disturbances in these icy realms can send transformative ripples around the globe, altering the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, and affecting every form of life.  And although the poles might seem constant and everlasting, they--like our planet--are always changing, with a deep and complex past.  NOVA will provide informal science learners access to specialized research happening at the ends of the earth, introducing them to today's scientists exploring the major drivers of the climate, uncovering the deep history of past paleoclimates, or perfecting climate and weather models.  The project includes: a 2-hour nationally broadcast PBS documentary (working title Polar Extremes); a NOVA Polar Lab, an experiential interactive learning platform on polar science; and a Polar Exploration Initiative consisting of a 10-part YouTube series, a collection of 360 videos, virtual field trips, and social media reporting ""on location"" from Antarctica, along with other polar-themed video, radio and digital journalism.  It also includes a research program conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to study how narrative-driven and experiential learning can foster informal learning in polar science across a diverse array of audiences.  NOVA, the most popular science program on television, with a robust digital presence, will bring current polar science to millions. <br/><br/>NOVA will use a range of media to transport viewers to remote polar locations, to interact with polar scientists, manipulate polar data, or vicariously explore the frozen tundra--using a mix of learning approaches.  This project will develop and test the impact of two forms of informal learning: traditional narrative-driven storytelling and active, experiential learning.   Both components will be developed through audience research, formative evaluation or pilot testing, and experiments.  The overarching goal is to determine the best way to combine and leverage traditional and interactive media technologies to educate the public about polar science.  How can these modes enhance learning outcomes?  The study uses the Informal Science Learning ""strand framework"" developed by the National Research Council in Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits (2009).  Because different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds may engage differently with different types of learning materials and platforms, the project components are designed to test a variety of different learning approaches, with different audiences.  This study will be one of the first to address the relative efficacy of various forms of experiential education and whether active versus vicarious experiential learning depends on the characteristics of the learners.  As engagement technologies continue to evolve, this project will help inform how to best design and apply them effectively.  The project will apply these new lessons specifically to present polar research to the public and to offer audiences an opportunity to explore and learn about these remote regions in new ways that bring them to life, make them relevant, and enhance learning outcomes.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  The project has co-funding support from the Office of Polar Programs (OPP)."

This project investigates how out-of-school time (OST) programs that integrate epistemic practices of the arts, sciences, computer science, and other disciplines, in the context of consequential activities (such as creating radio segments, designing museum exhibitions, or building online games), can more broadly appeal to and engage youth who do not already identify as STEM learners. STEM-related skills and capacities (such as computational thinking, design, data visualizations, and digital storytelling) are key to productive and creative participation in many future civic and workplace activities, and are driving the 30 fastest-growing occupations in the US. But many new jobs will entail a hybrid blend of skills, such as programming and design skills that many students who have disengaged with academic STEM pathways may already have and would be eager to develop further. There is not currently a strong foundation of research-based evidence to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation transdisciplinary programs - in which STEM skills are embedded as tools for meaningful participation - or how such approaches relate to long-term outcomes. Hypothesizing that OST programs which effectively engage youth during their high-leverage teenage years can significantly impact youths' longer-term STEM learning trajectories, this project will involve: 1) Five 3-year studies documenting learning in different technology-rich contexts: Making Afterschool, Media Production, Museum Exhibition Design, Digital Arts Programs, and Pop-Up/Street Science Programs; 2) A 4-year longitudinal study, involving 100 youth from the above programs; 3) The creation of a number of practical measurement tools that can be used to monitor how programs are leveraging the intersections of the arts and sciences to support student engagement and learning; and 4) A Professional Development program conducted at informal science education conferences in the EU and US to engage the informal STEM field with emerging findings. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences to better understand, strengthen, and coordinate STEM engagement and learning. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>Transdisciplinary, equity-oriented OST programs can provide supportive social contexts in which STEM concepts and practices are taken up as the means for meaningful participation in valued activities, building students' STEM skills in ways that can propel their future academic, career, and lifelong learning choices. This project will build the knowledge base about these emerging 21st century transdisciplinary approaches to broadening participation investigating: 1) The epistemic intersections across a range of disciplines (art, science, computation, design) that operate to broaden appeal and meaningful participation for underrepresented youth; 2) How transdisciplinary activities undertaken in the context of consequential learning (e.g., producing a radio segment, designing an exhibition for the general public) can illuminate the relevance of STEM to young people's lives, concerns, and futures; and 3) How participation in such programs can propel students' longer-term life choices and STEM learning trajectories. The project is a collaboration of the University of Washington, Science Gallery Dublin, Indiana University, Youth Radio in Oakland California, Guerilla Science in New York and London, and the London School of Economics."

TERC, Inc., in collaboration with Northeastern University and the cambridge, Newton, and Lowell, Massachusetts Public School Districts, will develop and study an education program that integrates computing into middle school Earth systems science by interweaving computational skills development into science game design and science content learning.  The project aims to develop skills among diverse groups of young people in two crucial fields central to national interest and safety.  More importantly, the project will bring these two fields together to create a learning environment in which young people learn thinking from a systems perspective, essential to solving complex scientific problems. The project will contribute to practical models for developing science content learning and computer skills, creating positive attitudes toward science, and broadening participation in the sciences among middle school students in diverse settings. <br/><br/>The Building Systems from Scratch project will develop, implement, and study an innovative intervention that integrates computing into an 8-week Earth systems curriculum and supporting resources.  The program will include: a) a standards-aligned curriculum focused on systems thinking practices, b) a 52-hour hybrid online/face-to-face teacher professional development workshop with supporting materials, c) a teacher leader guide for sustainable implementation of the program, and d) a website to support program materials, activities, and communication. Specifically, as students build their own science content games, they will engage in computational practices such as modeling, abstraction, management of complexity, and creative design, as well as iterative testing and debugging. The project seeks to understand how and what young people learn when they engage in interdisciplinary learning in technology-rich environments. It further seeks to understand how curricular structural supports influence student learning and self-efficacy.  The project will address specific needs of middle school students and teachers with regard to relevant disciplinary content, science practices, and computation as specified in Next Generation Science Standards and Computer Science Standards. The project will be working with fifteen 8th grade teachers in three Massachusetts school districts across three years, reaching approximately 1,840 8th grade students, over half of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM and computer science fields."

The project builds on the previous successful work by WGBH nationally distributing the television series NOVA scienceNOW and the research expertise of EDC.  WGBH's NOVA scienceNOW program will collaborate with EDC to develop new metrics to understand how and why learners engage with science on social media. Deliverables will include six one-hour episodes of NOVA scienceNOW, short online videos, moderated online discussion events, and an online film festival.

This project is significant because it will deepen the understanding of the importance of interest stereotypes (stereotypes about who shows interest in STEM) and how they influence students' motivation to pursue STEM. The project seeks to address the following objectives: (1) to examine how interest stereotypes affect girls' motivation; (2) to study whether interest stereotypes have a stronger negative impact than ability stereotypes on motivation for computer science; and (3) explore whether it is possible to intervene to reduce the impact of interest stereotypes. The findings will have implications for many fields conducting research that aims to reduce educational inequalities linked to stereotypes. This research has the potential to lead to more powerful interventions to help children resist such stereotypes and remain open to pursuing interests in STEM. Another major contribution of this work is to advance social identity theory beyond stereotype threat research on ability stereotypes. The project impact broadens the focus in STEM education by designing real-world interventions that can intervene at the root of the problem to counteract stereotypes and promote STEM motivation. In addition, the project will promote the use of the Open Science Framework to allow free sharing of the data and materials. It will help give students the tools they need to resist interest stereotypes and promote their interest in STEM, help teachers identify the most powerful messages to send their students to boost their motivation for STEM, and use an educational outreach network to connect and share findings broadly, with educators, policymakers, and the entire community of stakeholders working to promote students' motivation in STEM. <br/><br/>The research will examine how interest stereotypes influence 8-12-year-old children's motivation for computer science. The focus on computer science is due to its low representation of women and highly stereotyped nature. Several experiments will test (a) how interest stereotypes about gender groups impact girls' motivation for novel activities, (b) the impact of interest stereotypes vs. ability stereotypes for computer science activities with girls and boys, and (c) a novel intervention to reduce the impact of interest stereotypes and promote girls' computer science motivation, by linking existing gender differences to environmental structures rather than inherent group differences. The project provides rigorous, theoretically-based research, which is evident through the inclusion of power analysis, reference to previously validated instruments, and reporting of psychometrics. The results will deepen understanding of the importance of interest stereotypes and how they influence children's motivation to pursue STEM, and will lay the groundwork for future interventions that directly target interest stereotypes to boost girls' motivation in computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of this study will be to conduct exploratory-design work to produce both the design approach and the early-stage tasks that are critical inputs for creating a program of research and development to more fully develop a suite of innovative assessment tasks for the early grades. Specific goals of the effort will be: (1) to iteratively develop and refine a design approach that enables assessment designers to develop Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned tasks and rubrics that include a literacy component for the early grades; (2) to use this design approach to create two exemplar assessment tasks that are feasible for classroom use; and (3) to collect initial evidence that informs the promise of the design approach. <br/><br/>The work's research question will be: How can we extend current methodology to create assessments that integrate the three dimensions of the NGSS and literacy for early learners? The study will select first grade as the learning environment and two of the NGSS first grade performance expectations as the assessment targets.

The uses of technologies in emergency management and public safety are emerging rapidly, but it could take years for school STEM curricula to catch up with the technologies that are already being deployed in the field. Informal learning environments, such as Teen Science Cafs, provide a compelling venue for youth learning about rapidly-developing STEM fields such as technology. The floods and devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey provide a timely learning opportunity for them. This project, in addition to developing new materials for learning about technologies, will provide much-needed baseline research on teens' understanding of technology, technology careers, and emergency preparedness.<br/><br/>Leveraging the robust platform of the NSF-funded Teen Science Caf, the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance will build upon its existing partnership with Science Education Solutions to develop and implement a package of educational activities, tools, and resources for a Teen Science Caf that is focused on community flood events and response, using Hurricane Harvey as a model and case study. The materials will focus on advances in sensor technology, data visualization, social media, and other mobile communication apps used to detect, monitor and respond to flooding and natural disasters. The package of materials will be embraced by 20 sites in Maine. The goal is to engage at least 600 youth in themed Cafs focusing on how technology was used to respond to Harvey and is being used to manage and respond to flooding more generally. An important related goal is to conduct baseline research on what teens currently know about the flood-related technologies, as well as what they learn about it from this experience derived from recent floods in Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean islands."

This project aims at investigating the connections between computational thinking and mathematical and scientific practices as outlined in the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) through large-scale deployment of an online curriculum for development of computational thinking. The computational skills will be delivered to elementary, middle, and high-school students through three separate age- and grade-appropriate game-based computational thinking curriculum using an adaptive educational platform focused on developing higher-order skills that are likely transferable to mathematics and science learning. Two research questions will guide the research and development activities: (1) Can the game-based computational thinking curriculum lead to improvement in students' mathematics and science practices, as well as their computing skills?; and (2) What are the optimal characteristics of curriculum materials and teacher enactment that would lead to greatest outcomes at different grade levels? To answer these questions, the project will: (1) develop computational thinking problem-based learning experiences with a focus on computational thinking embedded in three age-appropriate instructional games for elementary, middle, and high school students; (2) provide scaffolded teacher support for delivering the learning experience that does not require any computational background for teachers; (3) develop valid measures towards assessing acquisition of shared practices; (4) implement the curricula and evaluate their effects through large-scale statewide in three states with over 3,000 teachers and over 90,000 students; (5) connect the computational challenges with mathematics word problem solving and analyze the practice transfer; and (6) iterate the interventions and validation over multiple years with data-driven optimization towards greater transfer outcomes.<br/><br/>The study will adopt the notion of computational thinking as a problem-solving process that is transferable to a wide variety of situations, including practical applications in mathematics and science. Thus, the premise of this effort will be that practices at the core of computational thinking are closely related to the mathematics and science practices identified in the CCSS and NGSS. In order to demonstrate how appropriate skills are developed across grade levels, the project will develop three separate game-based interventions appropriate for elementary, middle, and high school students, including problem-based computational thinking learning experiences that will be embedded in each of these games. To facilitate the successful implementation of the game-based learning technologies and curricula, the project will integrate computational games with the Teacher Co-Pilot, a learning platform that will provide teachers with lesson plans and step-by-step processes for classroom activities, which are directly deployed on student computers. The design of the Teacher Co-Pilot assumes that teachers will learn best by doing the lesson, so the experience will be tailored towards minimum startup time. To address the two research questions, the project will investigate whether a game-based computational thinking curriculum can lead to improvement in selected aspects of students' mathematics and science practices, as well as their computing skills. This will be achieved through the refinement and deployment of the three games at scale and assessing transfer with cognitive interviews of a small sample of students and carefully developed assessments with all the participating students. Likewise, the project will investigate the optimal characteristics of curriculum materials and teacher enactment that would lead to greatest outcomes at different grade levels via integration with the Teacher Co-Pilot platform, through which the project will investigate the most effective minimal scaffolding needed for teachers. This will be accomplished through pilot studies in two iterations with a sample of 40 teachers and focus group interviews to investigate useful and optimal feedback for teachers. The key outcome of this project will be research-informed and field-tested prototypes of game-based curriculum focused on the integration of computational thinking and science and mathematics learning across grade levels, freely available to educators for implementation of adaptation beyond the duration of the project. An advisory board will conduct the formative and summative evaluation of the project."

This project will advance research and development of new transdisciplinary approaches to computational STEM teaching and learning that will integrate the fields of computational thinking and science learning.  The project will synthesize across frameworks and definitions of computational thinking to identify those aspects that best position youth for future science learning.  The resulting construct, Computational Thinking for Science (CT-S) will be examined through the development of valid and reliable assessments, and the project team will investigate whether, for whom, and under what circumstances CT-S enables success in proximal science learning experiences. Findings will contribute to the field by describing the varied ways that students develop CT-S skill sets and the degree to which CT-S supports science learning and developing STEM career preferences. This will inform future curriculum and instructional development that integrates computational thinking and science learning in productive and supportive ways. This project is supported by the STEM + Computing Program that advances research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The examination of CT-S will be embedded in a new Next Generation Science Standards-aligned, technology rich middle school science curriculum aimed at supporting the development of computational thinking. The research plan includes articulation of the CT-S construct and associated hypothetical learning progression, and development of CT-S assessment instruments embedded in three different science topics. These instruments will be validated via cognitive interviews with students, qualitative analysis of the pilot responses, and cross validated with student logs of simulations used in the curriculum. The project will use these instruments to conduct a multi-cohort one year longitudinal study with 1300 middle school students, exploring the relationship of CT-S with learning and career awareness outcomes and identify variations between subgroups. Data gathered over this longitudinal study will be analyzed through two analytical models. The first correlational model will examine CT-S as a predictor of engagement during learning experiences and science content learning. The second explores variations within and across individuals using HLM models to examine how CT-S changes during the middle grade years. Outcomes of this work will be shared to inform professional, practioner, and policy communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will integrate computational models in online environments using StarLogo Nova to allow all students, including ELs, to model causal relationships that explain the studied phenomena. Plans are to enhance and integrate StarLogo Nova, a block-based programming environment with an agent-based simulation engine for modeling complex systems. Using the enhanced StarLogo Nova, the project will embed CT throughout the yearlong NGSS-aligned curriculum for students and teachers. <br/><br/>The project will take place in Elizabeth Public Schools in Elizabeth, New Jersey (NJ), and Metro Nashville Public Schools in Nashville, Tennessee (TN). These are two distinct sites with diverse student populations. NJ adopted the NGSS and is currently working out implementation plans, whereas TN represents states that have not adopted the NGSS. The study has two main goals: (1) to investigate feasibility of implementation of the curriculum model in classrooms; and (2) to investigate the extent to which the curriculum promotes student learning outcomes. To achieve the first goal in terms of feasibility of classroom implementation, the project will examine the following research questions: (1) To what extent and how do elementary school teachers support students' engagement in computational modeling?; (2) To what extent and how do students engage in computational modeling?; and (3) What design features of the curriculum and software support students' engagement in computational modeling? Data gathering strategies will include focus groups, field notes to document teachers' feedback, and classroom observations, including videotaping. To achieve the second goal in terms of student learning outcomes, the project will examine the following questions: (4) How do students' understanding of the causal relationships underlying phenomena evolve as they engage in physical, diagrammatic, and computational modeling over the year?; and (5) How do students' understanding of key aspects of CT (e.g., abstraction, pattern generalization, representational competence, modularization, algorithmic notions of flow of control, and conditional logic) evolve as they engage in computational modeling over the full-year curriculum? To measure student learning outcomes, the project will use student assessments of science and CT. A principal outcome of this project will be a field-tested and research-informed model that integrates (a) science learning, (b) language learning, and (c) infusion of critical CT constructs and ideas. An external evaluation will include formative and summative components to provide an independent perspective on the project's work, contributions, and quality of outcomes in terms of design critique, research audit, products review, and collaboration assessment."

The curriculum will scaffold student understanding of computational modeling as a core practice used to explore and understand ecosystem interactions, such as the interconnection of habitats within an ecosystem and species survival. Integrating computer modeling in the elementary science curriculum advances important 21st century learning goals regarding computational thinking within disciplinary contexts. The design-based research will investigate the seamless integration of life science, mathematics, and computing to improve both student learning and teaching and will contribute substantially to advancing elementary science, technology, mathematics, and computing education that will reveal important aspects of children's understanding of complex environmental and computational thinking concepts.

Investments are made in critical areas of pedagogy, pre-service education, and in-service teacher professional development.   <br/><br/>The project will use design-based research to combine an immersive virtual environment with hands-on interactive modeling through a scaffolded computational interface that will connect visual models to dynamic representations of ecosystem interactions in a simulated forest setting. The curriculum will provide a supported, object-oriented programming environment (similar to Scratch and StarLogo NOVA) with a simple, scaffolded block interface customized to focus on ecosystems modeling, and designed specifically for younger children. The learning goals related to the study of habitats and food webs are taught using a systems perspective, shifting the instructional focus from comprehension of static representations to consequential student interaction with dynamic computational models. The project will investigate which approaches to abstraction and representation offer the best scaffolding to young students and to what extent students are able to construct, modify, and interpret computational models of ecological concepts; to what extent do students show gains in understanding of causal dynamics in ecosystem science; and how teachers can best incorporate an interdisciplinary science and computing curricula in their practice.

The project is a collaboration between the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network, and Design I/O. It will address the need for improved data, modeling and computational literacy in young people through development and testing of a portable, computer-based simulation of interactions that occur within ecosystems and between coupled natural and human systems; computational thinking skills are required to advance farther in the simulation. On a tablet computer at NYSCI, each participant will receive a set of virtual ""cards"" that require them to enter a computer command, routine or algorithm to control the behavior of animals within a simulated ecosystem.   As participants explore the animals' simulated habitat, they will learn increasingly more complex strategies needed for the animal's survival, will use similar computational ideas and skills that ecologists use to model complex, dynamic ecological systems, and will respond to the effects of the ecosystem changes that they and other participants elicit through interaction with the simulated environment. Research on this approach to understanding interactions among species within biological systems through integration of computing has potential to advance knowledge.  Researchers will study how simulations that are similar to popular collectable card game formats can improve computational thinking and better prepare STEM learners to take an interest in, and advance knowledge in, the field of environmental science as their academic and career aspirations evolve. The project will also design and develop a practical approach to programing complex models, and develop skills in communities of young people to exercise agency in learning about modeling and acting within complex systems; deepening learning in young people about how to work toward sustainable solutions, solve complex engineering problems and be better prepared to address the challenges of a complex, global society. <br/><br/>Computational Thinking in the Ecosystems (CT-E) will use a design-based study to prototype and test this novel, tablet-based collectable card game-like intervention to develop innovative practices in middle school science. Through this approach, some of the most significant challenges to teaching practice in the Next Generation Science Standards will be addressed, through infusing computational thinking into life science learning. CT-E will develop a tablet-based simulation representing six dynamic, interconnected ecosystems in which students control the behaviors of creatures to intervene in habitats to accomplish goals and respond to changes in the health of their habitat and the ecosystems of which they are a part. Behaviors of creatures in the simulation are controlled through the virtual collectable ""cards"", with each representing a computational process (such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals and events). Gameplay involves individual players choosing a creature and habitat, formulating strategies and programming that creature with tactics in that habitat (such as finding food, digging in the ground, diverting water, or removing or planting vegetation) to navigate that habitat and survive. Habitats chosen by the participant are part of particular kinds of biomes (such as desert, rain forest, marshlands and plains) that have their own characteristic flora, fauna, and climate. Because the environments represent complex dynamic interconnected environmental models, participants are challenged to explore how these models work, and test hypotheses about how the environment will respond to their creature's interventions; but also to the creatures of other players, since multiple participants can collaborate or compete similar to commercially available collectable card games (e.g., Magic and Yu-Go-Oh!). NYSCI will conduct participatory design based research to determine impacts on structured and unstructured learning settings and whether it overcomes barriers to learning complex environmental science."

To achieve this goal, the project will use classroom-based science assessment as a focus around which to build teacher capacity in science instruction and three-dimensional learning in science. The three dimensions will include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. These dimensions are described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, 2012), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). The project will work closely with teachers to co-develop usable assessments and rubrics and help them to learn about three-dimensional assessment and instruction. Also, the project will work with teachers to test the developed assessments in diverse settings, and to create an active, online community of practice. <br/><br/>The two research questions will be: (1) How well do these assessments function with respect to aspects of validity for classroom use, particularly in terms of indicators of student proficiency, and tools to support teacher instructional practice?; and (2) In what ways do providing these assessment tasks and rubrics, and supporting teachers in their use, advance teachers' formative assessment practices to support multi-dimensional science instruction? The research and development components of this project will produce assessments and rubrics, which can directly impact students and teachers in the districts and states that have adopted the NGSS, as well as those that have embraced the vision of science teaching and learning embodied in the NRC Framework. The project will consist of five major tasks. First, the effort will iteratively develop assessments and rubrics for formative use, using an evidence-centered design approach. Second, it will collect data from evidence-based revision and redesign of the assessments from teachers piloting the assessments and rubrics, project cognitive laboratory studies with students, and an external review of the assessments design products. Third, it will study teachers' classroom use of assessments to understand and document how they blend assessment and instruction. The project will use pre/post questionnaires, video recordings, observation field notes, and pre/post interviews. Fourth, the study will build the capacity of participating teachers. Teacher Collaborators (n=9) will engage in participatory design of the assessment tasks and act as technical assistants to the overall implementation process. Teacher Implementers (n=15) will use the assessments formatively as part of their instructional practice. Finally, the work will develop a community of learners through the development of a technical assistance infrastructure, and leveraging teacher expertise to formatively assess students' work, using the assessments designed to be diagnostic and instructionally informative. External reviewers and an advisory board will provide formative feedback on the project's processes and summative evaluation of the project's results.

The project team will: 1) work with kindergarten teachers to modify an existing Grade 2 curricular unit for use with their students; 2) design a parallel curricular unit incorporating technology; 3) evaluate both units for feasibility and maturation effects; and 4) iteratively revise and pilot an integrated unit and assess kindergarten student conceptual understanding of matter and its changes. The results of this investigation will contribute important data on the evolving structure and content of children's physical science models as well as demonstrate children's understanding of matter and its changes.  <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects."

In addition, there are increasing demands for broadening the participation in the computer science workforce by women and members of minority populations. SRI International will examine the relationships among the factors that influence the implementation of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS), a pre-Advanced Placement curriculum that prepares students for further study in computer science. SRI will work in partnership with the ECS curriculum developers, teachers, and the nonprofit Code.org who are involved in the scaling of ECS. This study elucidates how variation in curricular implementation influences student learning and determines not only what works, but also for whom and under what circumstances.<br/><br/>SRI will conduct a pilot study in which they develop, pilot, and refine measures as they recruit school districts for the implementation study.  The subsequent implementation study will be a 2 year examination of curriculum enactment, teacher practice, and evidence of student learning. Because no comparable curriculum currently exists, the study will examine the conditions needed to implement the ECS curriculum in ways that improve student computational thinking outcomes rather than determine whether the ECS curriculum is more effective than other CS-related curricula. The study will conduct two kinds of analyses: 1) an analysis of the influence of ECS on student learning gains, and 2) an analysis of the relationship between classroom-level implementation and student learning gains.  Because of the clustered nature of the data (students nested within classrooms nested within schools), the project will use hierarchical linear modeling to examine the influence of the curriculum."

This project will meet this goal through rigorous research and the broad implementation of an environmental science literacy professional development and learning program for informal educators and youth engaged in outdoor science programs (OSP). With growing support from the literature and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), much attention has been placed on creating and leveraging interdisciplinary science learning opportunities beyond science classrooms. As such, an estimated 300 residential OSPs currently exist in the United States. Unfortunately, the informal educators often charged with facilitating these deep and impactful science learning experiences often lack robust formal training in evidenced-based, age-appropriate environmental science content knowledge and pedagogy specific for the youth in their programs. This issue is often more pronounced in under-resourced and under-served programs and communities. This project will directly address these pervasive challenges in the field by not only providing much needed science focused professional development and resources to informal educators but also by specifically targeting and training informal leaders and educators serving youth in predominately rural areas, low-income communities, and underrepresented communities. <br/><br/>Approximately 200 OSP leaders at 100 OSPs around the country will participate in a week-long, intensive training in the professional development model at one of five regional residential leadership institutes. OSP leaders will then redeliver the training to the approximately 1,500 OSP educators/field instructors in their home institutions. The OSP educators/field instructors will then use what they learn through the professional development to facilitate the environmental science learning program (i.e., curriculum, field experiences, resources, pedagogy) to over 1 million youth (grades 3-8) enrolled in their residential outdoor science programs.  In addition, a rigorous implementation study, efficacy study and evaluation will be conducted. The implementation study will investigate: (a) Which of the professional learning model practices were implemented and (b) What successes and challenges the programs faced implementing the model. The mixed methods efficacy study will explore: (a) if outdoor science programs contribute to the development of science learning activation and environmental literacy? and (b) what are the features of these experiences that are correlated with increases in science learning activation and environmental literacy. Approximately 25-35 youth will be randomly selected from each of 50 randomly selected sites to participate in the efficacy study. The data and findings from the research and evaluation produced by this project will contribute to a relatively sparse knowledge and research base specific to youth efficacy and implementation processes and practices across nearly 1/3 of the estimated 300 existing residential outdoor science programs in the United States."

Students are expected to learn science concepts and use their understanding to investigate the natural world through scientific inquiry. They must also develop higher-order reasoning skills, integrate knowledge and ideas using primary sources, use causal reasoning to understand the chain of events, delineate and evaluate claims, and assess the reasoning used in arguments.  Lower participation and achievement in science courses makes students with learning disabilities less likely to pursue STEM degrees, STEM careers, and succeed in the labor market where higher order thinking skills and scientific literacy are increasingly important. It is important to develop innovative tools that build on evidence based practices in combination with promising new technologies to improve the academic trajectory in STEM disciplines. The purpose of this project is to develop and refine an innovative Google-platform based application called CORGI for use with middle school students in physical, life, and earth science classrooms. The new version, CORGI_2, will include supports for content learning and higher order thinking and will pair with the cloud-based applications of the Google environment to offer multiple means of representation, response and engagement as well as videos, models, supports for decoding, and supports for background knowledge. The team will refine CORGI to offer enhanced functionality and supports for scientific argumentation, concept mastery, collaboration strategies and social skills for cooperative groups.  Technology enhancements will include multimedia input and output, writing supports (e.g., sentence starters), discussion threads, and affective reactions to content/lessons. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program, which funds research and development on STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>The research team will work with both teachers and students to develop integrated units, new higher order thinking routines, learning and collaboration strategies, and new technological functionality in CORGI_2. Researcher-practitioner-student design teams will use Design-Based Intervention Research (DBR) methods to iteratively: (a) identify the science content for inclusion, (b) develop integrated content units in life, physical, and earth science, (c) integrate additional higher order thinking and learning strategies to promote higher-order thinking and reasoning, and (c) design and implement additional UDL and mobile functionality for CORGI_2. Participants will include 30 middle school teachers and approximately 200 students with learning disabilities, including reading disabilities.  Researchers will collect formative evaluation data from teachers and students to examine the usability, science content learning, higher order thinking skills, engagement, and motivation of general education and special education students in middle school classrooms. Professional development modules will be developed to support the DBR cycles as well as to support wider scale adoption and use by all students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But what are the most effective ways to support teachers' professional development?  BSCS Science Learning and the University of Minnesota STEM Education Program Area explore this question by adapting an effective teacher professional development model -- that meets face-to-face in real-time -- to an online approach. A defining feature of the Science Teachers Learning from Lesson Analysis (STeLLA) Professional Development program is its use of videos of classroom instruction and examples of student work to promote teacher learning. Skilled facilitators guide teachers' analysis and discussion of other teachers' work; then, teachers begin to apply the analytical techniques they have learned to their own teaching. Adapting the STeLLA program to an online learning model is important because it can reach a broader and more diverse audience such as teachers working in rural school districts and underserved communities. To further promote the reach of STeLLA, the online version of STeLLA will engage and prepare teacher leaders to support their peers' engagement and understanding. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. Guided by theories of situated cognition and cognitive apprenticeship this project focuses on two questions: How can the STeLLA professional development model be adapted to an online environment? and Does participation in the online model show meaningful teacher and student outcomes related to science teaching and learning? Challenges related to adaptation include understanding the duration and intensity of teacher engagement, the quality of their science content learning experiences, and how teacher learning is scaffolded across the online and traditional model. The project will unfold in two phases. Phase 1 uses a design-based research approach to rapidly enact, test, and revise online program components while remaining true to the design principles underlying the traditional STeLLA PD program. Phase 2 uses a quasi-experimental approach to test STeLLA Online's influence on teacher content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, practice and on upper elementary student science achievement. Comparisons will be made between STeLLA Online, face-to-face STeLLA, and a traditional professional development program that emphasizes deepening content knowledge only. This comparison leverages data from a previously-completed cluster randomized trial of STeLLA funded by the NSF.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Supporting Teachers in Responsive Instruction for Developing Expertise in Science (STRIDES) project takes advantage of advanced technologies to support science teachers to rapidly respond to diverse student ideas in their classrooms. In this project students will use web-based curriculum units to engage with models, simulations, and virtual experiments to write multiple explanations for standards-based science topics. Advanced technologies (including natural language processing) will be used to assess students' written responses and summaries their science understanding in real-time.  The project will also design planning tools for teachers that will make suggestions relevant research-proven instructional strategies based on the real-time analysis of student responses. Research will examine how teachers make use of the feedback and suggestions to customize their instruction. Further we will study how these instructional changes help students develop coherent understanding of complex science topics and ability to make sense of models and graphs. The findings will be used to refine the tools that analyze the student essays and generate the summaries; improve the research-based instructional suggestions in the planning tool; and strengthen the online interface for teachers. The tools will be incorporated into open-source, freely available online curriculum units.

Variability among members of a species provides the foundation for theories of genetics, natural selection, and evolution. However, people typically underestimate the amount of variability that occurs within a species over the life span of animals and from one generation to the next. Children especially seem to have cognitive biases that members of a species are largely identical. To improve children's learning about biology, educators need better ways to scaffold children's understanding of biological variability. Diagrams and other visual representations are useful in promoting learning about biological variability, but diagrams can also be confusing. This project focuses on designing better visual representations of important types of variability, such as variability across life stages (e.g., in metamorphosis) and variability between parent and offspring (in genetic transmission). By studying how to make more effective visual representations, this project will inform efforts to improve science education, and will also provide information about the ways in which children's cognitive biases influence their scientific thinking more generally. This project is supported by an award to the University of Wisconsin by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>To investigate how visual representations can be used to promote learning and transfer about biological variability, researchers in cognitive development and education will focus on two types of visual representations: life cycle diagrams and genetic diagrams. The research will investigate three key issues. First, 6- to 12-year-old children's beliefs about inheritance will be investigated to examine how strongly they expect consistency of traits from parent to offspring (i.e., in genetic transmission). Second, a series of studies will investigate how features of diagrams affect children's learning and transfer of knowledge about the life cycle and about genetic transmission. The studies will address whether highlighting generality, avoiding extraneous details, and highlighting variability in diagrams lead to optimal learning and transfer. To investigate these issues, lab-based experiments will be carried out that compare children's learning from visual representations that vary in targeted ways. The data analysis will address how children transfer their knowledge beyond the exemplars that are the focus of the learning tasks. Third, the results of Studies 1 and 2 will be used to inform the design of optimized diagrams, and the effects of these optimized diagrams on learning about biological change will be investigated during science workshops at a children's museum and during community-based science events using a pre-test - intervention - post-test design. This aspect of the research will also examine whether effective learning activities about within-species variability support children's reasoning about natural selection, evolution, and inheritance. The potential for broader impacts is substantial. Enabling children (and adults) to recognize different types of variability could have a significant impact on their biological thought and on the design of biology instruction. Better understanding of how specific visual features of diagrams contribute to or detract from science understanding may have important implications for the design and use of visual representations to convey scientific information in both formal and informal learning environments. This project also supports collaboration between science educators and researchers in cognitive development, providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be shared with academic researchers, and with educators in formal and informal science learning environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project will conduct a two-day workshop that will gather citizen science project leaders to address barriers in citizen science research and infrastructure: The inability to holistically study the movement, engagement, persistence and learning outcomes among volunteers engaged in multiple projects. The past few years have been a time of tremendous growth in awareness of and interest in citizen science projects. The project will address an increasing gap preventing projects in three now-popular categories (apps, projects hosted on government websites, and event-based projects) from adopting the digital tools created and available through SciStarter.com. The workshop will bring citizen science project leaders together to deepen an understanding of their needs regarding the adoption of digital tools, developed by Scistarter, which will result in more comprehensive data in support of research in informal science learning outcomes of volunteers engaged in citizen science across projects and platforms. The in-person and online contributions from participants will guide the development of resources and tutorials to scale adoption.<br/><br/>SciStarter is a repository of hundreds of citizen science projects. Through previous NSF support, SciStarter developed digital affiliate tools which project leaders use on their own websites to enable analytics (statistics gathered from user activity online)  to help projects more easily recruit and coordinator volunteers, help volunteers track their contributions across projects and platforms, and help researchers holistically study the movement and learning outcomes across projects and platforms. The proposed workshop will facilitate iteration and adoption of the tools among three classes of projects, not originally accounted for, which have dramatically increased in numbers during the past year: 1) app-based projects, 2) projects hosted on government websites, and 3) event-based projects.. By co-designing and implementing iterative versions of the tools among these projects, the project will address important gaps in research, enable a richer, more comprehensive understanding of volunteer engagement patterns, and discover opportunities to build a stronger community of citizen science practitioners who collaborate to enhance volunteer learning communities.  The project will culminate in improved research in this field and improved management of citizen science projects for appropriate recruitment and retention that fosters STEM learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The professional development will provide teachers with instructional strategies that promote students' relational mattering and sense of belonging that will help retain students in the STEM pipeline. The project will target low-income African-American students from three high need schools in Washington, DC, through engagement in life science lessons with the ultimate goal of increasing students' awareness and interest in STEM. This intervention will offer continuous professional development to promote teachers' use of asset-focused instructional strategies that take into account students' cultural practices, values, and lived experiences evident in the children's home or community environments. Professional development will be offered through face-to-face summer and academic year professional development academies and the Torsh TALENT technology online platform. Both pathways feature ongoing review of instructional and student learning practices, immediate feedback between trainers and teachers, more opportunities for teachers to view and reflect on their craft, and space for virtual life science communal exchange across participating schools. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>A mixed methods research design will be used to collect focus group and survey data, as well as conduct classroom observations, to determine if the foreground variables of students' relational mattering, sense of belonging, and engagement are interrelated. Research literature has shown that students' engagement in the learning process is an important predictor of ultimate academic performance outcomes. It is anticipated that the students' socioemotional perceptions should positively relate not only to each other but to student engagement levels as well; hence helping to confirm the academic relevance of such socioemotional considerations. The Student Socioemotional Perception Tool will be modified to assess students' perception changes given their teachers' participation in the professional development intervention.  The study of these social emotional factors with elementary age African-American students in high needs school settings has the potential to advance the knowledge of largely unexplored conceptual directions in need of systematic empirical scrutiny. The Talent Quest Model, based on the human capacity framework, is actualized in how teachers elicit and use student assets with regard to lessons, learning activities, and life science subject matter inside classrooms on an everyday basis. Hence, a major outcome will be modifying a developmentally appropriate measurement tool to gauge elementary level students' perspectives on their relational mattering and sense of belonging during life science lessons beyond its early development and pilot stage."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understanding of deeper learning by participants. This pilot study, Akeakamai (Hawaiian, literally lover of wisdom, scientist, scholar), will explore the convergence of contemporary Western science topics with indigenous Hawaiian culture-based science experiences as a mechanism to strengthen STEM perceptions, cross-cultural science collaboration, and multi-generational community engagement with STEM. The work is grounded in the notion that STEM learning within the context of local informal indigenous community settings should be culturally responsive and culturally sustaining, and should privilege indigenous epistemologies. If successful, the results of this pilot could provide valuable insights on effective approaches to developing and implementing culturally consistent and sustainable multigenerational STEM engagement among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and across the Pacific region.<br/><br/>Over a two-year duration, the study will address three research questions. (1) To what extent does inclusion of culture into curriculum designed for informal Culture-Science Explorations mitigate perceived barriers to participation in science? (2) What barriers do community members perceive to limit their participation in science? (3) What are the areas of consonance between Native Hawaiian and Western scientific approaches to knowledge and learning? Approximately 200 predominantly Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, ranging in age from 8 - 85 years old, will participate in the pilot.  The research team will collect participant data during all phases of the social intervention, a suite of culture-science exploration experiences held at the Halau Inana, a Native Hawaiian community collaboration space. The intervention will employ pedagogical methods that are responsive to Hawaiian cultural norms to deliver content that integrates across the interfaces of Western science and technology and indigenous knowledge, and incorporates Hawaiian language. A rigorous external evaluation will also be conducted. The results of the research and evaluation will be broadly disseminated. Ultimately, the project aims to develop a conceptual and practical cross-cultural, multi-generational framework for community-based science learning in Hawai'i that can serve as a model for future research and programs that extend into and beyond indigenous communities of the Pacific region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last decade, there has been a steady decline in the number of women earning bachelor's degrees in computing, with the percentage decreasing from 27.5% in 2002 to 18.2% in 2012, continuing a trend where in some US states no female high school students took the Advanced Placement in CS exam. With the current push to re-introduce CS education into the K-12 schools, there is a great need for carefully developed curriculum materials that introduce high school students to key CS concepts and practices that are also rich and diverse in content that can broaden high school students' perceptions of computing and CS career aspirations coupled together with teacher professional development. The project will mainly take place in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in addition to the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), two of the largest public school districts in the country with high percentages of underserved students. The study also uncovered that high numbers of low-income students of color were offering courses labeled as CS, but their coursework included little other than keyboarding and other basic rudimentary computing skills. Rarely did schools offer rigorous computer science courses, but when they did, they were located in affluent communities and included few girls or students of color. Los Angeles Unified School district (LAUSD) students in ECS reveal high participation rates that closely mirror District demographics. In 2013-14, over 2500 LAUSD students enrolled in ECS; 73% of the students were Latino, 11% African American, 7% Asian, 8% White, and 46% female. There are no other nationwide computer science programs that have attracted such diverse students. <br/><br/>The grant's goals will be (1) to develop robust curricular materials that are accessible to a large group of teachers and students, particularly in underserved communities, (2) to provide evidence that students not only can learn key CS concepts and practices with electronic textiles but also broaden their perspectives of computing and STEM career aspirations, (3) to illustrate an alternative model to competitions for showcasing and disseminating students' final e-textile designs and (4) to pilot teacher professional development. Our interdisciplinary team, versed in addressing issues of equity and diversity in CS, will bring together expertise from curriculum design, computer science, and learning sciences. The CS curriculum will be consisted of six units covering: Human-Computer Interaction, Problem-Solving, Web Design, Introduction to Programming (Scratch), Computing and Data Analysis, and Robotics. The instructional design of the course will adopt inquiry-based teaching practices so that all students are given opportunities to explore, design investigations, think critically, test solutions, and solve real problems. These links to computational thinking will also connect ECS to the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. A key part of ECS will be a professional development (PD) program that builds and supports an on-going teacher learning community. The ECS PD program will spans two years with a combination of two summer week-long institutes and quarterly Saturday workshops. The key features of ECS PD will include: (1) immersion into inquiry and equity-based practices; (2) a focus on teachers' instructional practice done through a teacher-learner-observer model, where teachers take turns planning and delivering lessons in teams with feedback in debrief sessions with fellow teachers; and (3) development of an on-going professional learning. The proposed development of the ECS curriculum and teacher professional development will use electronic textiles with middle and high school students to support their learning of computer science CS concepts and practices and their broadening of perceptions of computing. The project will be leveraged with previous foundational work that developed and piloted introductory and advanced electronic textile activities to introduce CS concepts and practices in line with the existing ECS curriculum to promote computational thinking."

This collaborative project will conduct early stage research on promising advances in how we prepare science teachers to support three-dimensional science learning as outlined in the Framework for Science Education (National Research Council, 2012). In order to achieve the new goals for science teaching and learning aimed for in current standards reforms, there is a need for radically new models of professional development of science teachers. While prior research has identified that 80-100 hours of professional development is necessary for teachers to change their instructional vision and practice to align with the Next Generation Science Standards, most states and districts who are adopting the new standards do not have the resources to support teacher preparation to this extent.  This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new approach to designing support tools and professional development focused on adapting classroom assessments that achieves these shifts in teachers' instructional vision and practice in less than 20 hours of professional development. The team will also discern the contributions to changes in teachers' instructional vision when teachers only use the support tools versus using the tools in the context of the full professional development model. Evidence of effectiveness of this high leverage approach to teacher preparation focused on adapting classroom assessments is important in order to develop scalable solutions to the significant science teacher professional development need created by the recent adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards by 28 states and numerous other districts.<br/><br/>The project will conduct a two-iteration comparative research study that explores differences in outcomes between science teachers who use only the support tools as resources to adapt classroom tasks versus those who use the tools as part of a two-day professional development experience. The outcomes include changes in teachers' instructional vision related to three-dimensional science learning as measured by a teacher vision survey and teacher interviews, and improvements in the quality of teachers' adapted assessment tasks as determined by a rubric-based analysis and observations of the professional development sessions.  Data analysis will follow a conjecture-mapping strategy to compare changes over time within and across groups in order to evaluate hypothesized links between design features of the tools and professional development models, mediating processes, and outcomes.  Findings of this study will provide evidence to inform instructional leaders and designs for science teacher preparation, and lead to future development and research in this area."

Thinking about systems is increasingly important for students to understand complex topics in science and engineering.  Building models based on evidence is important for helping students think critically in general, and about complex systems ideas in particular. To support students in these efforts, the project develops an easy-to-use software modeling tool that supports students in creating models while concurrently indicating the sources of evidence (data, simulations, etc.) that support their model-building choices. The products of this project, which include software, curriculum, and assessments, increase the capacity to engage young learners in ambitious science educational experiences that are consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards. Outcomes of the project include professional development materials, scaffolding tools, and assessments which will be made freely available via the project website. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.<br/><br/>This project transforms the way simulations are used to help students develop scientific practices, epistemologies, and content knowledge within elementary school science classrooms. It explores how 5th grade students treat simulations as similar to and distinct from other sources of evidence when engaged in scientific inquiry. By carefully selecting disparate and sometimes contradictory forms of evidence, the project challenges students to reflect upon their beliefs about how simulations of scientific concepts both do, and do not reflect the phenomena under study. Building on past work, the project is developing a scaffolded framework for teaching students about complex systems concepts in the context of aquatic ecosystems. This software and associated curriculum aims to help students engage deeply with the specific biology content, the important cross-cutting systems concepts that it represents, and the crucial scientific practices that are involved in constructing scientific models based on multiple disparate forms of evidence. This project will therefore focus on two of the key cross-cutting concepts from the Next Generation Science Standards--systems thinking and scientific practices. The project investigates the efficacy of posited scaffolds and interventions through three complementary approaches: tutoring studies in more controlled settings with smaller sample sizes,  design experiments in five fifth-grade classrooms, and a quasi-experimental study. The classroom design experiments and experimental studies are carried out in diverse educational settings in Indiana and New Jersey. Outcomes measured include both student growth and discourse and interactions from video analysis.  Measures of student growth include interviews and written student artifacts.  Measures of discourse and interactions are coded as variables derived from video analysis. The findings support designers, researchers, and educators who not only make use of simulations in science curricula, but help situate them within robust scientific practices and habits of mind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.<br/><br/>This project transforms the way simulations are used to help students develop scientific practices, epistemologies, and content knowledge within elementary school science classrooms. It explores how 5th grade students treat simulations as similar to and distinct from other sources of evidence when engaged in scientific inquiry. By carefully selecting disparate and sometimes contradictory forms of evidence, the project challenges students to reflect upon their beliefs about how simulations of scientific concepts both do, and do not reflect the phenomena under study. Building on past work, the project is developing a scaffolded framework for teaching students about complex systems concepts in the context of aquatic ecosystems. This software and associated curriculum aims to help students engage deeply with the specific biology content, the important cross-cutting systems concepts that it represents, and the crucial scientific practices that are involved in constructing scientific models based on multiple disparate forms of evidence. This project will therefore focus on two of the key cross-cutting concepts from the Next Generation Science Standards--systems thinking and scientific practices. The project investigates the efficacy of posited scaffolds and interventions through three complementary approaches: tutoring studies in more controlled settings with smaller sample sizes,  design experiments in five fifth-grade classrooms, and a quasi-experimental study. The classroom design experiments and experimental studies are carried out in diverse educational settings in Indiana and New Jersey. Outcomes measured include both student growth and discourse and interactions from video analysis.  Measures of student growth include interviews and written student artifacts.  Measures of discourse and interactions are coded as variables derived from video analysis. The findings support designers, researchers, and educators who not only make use of simulations in science curricula, but help situate them within robust scientific practices and habits of mind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its main goal is to better understand how to build and sustain the capacity of elementary science teachers in grades 3-5 to instruct and formatively assess students in ways that are aligned with contemporary science education frameworks and standards. To achieve this goal, the project will use classroom-based science assessment as a focus around which to build teacher capacity in science instruction and three-dimensional learning in science. The three dimensions will include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. These dimensions are described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, 2012), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). The project will work closely with teachers to co-develop usable assessments and rubrics and help them to learn about three-dimensional assessment and instruction. Also, the project will work with teachers to test the developed assessments in diverse settings, and to create an active, online community of practice. <br/><br/>The two research questions will be: (1) How well do these assessments function with respect to aspects of validity for classroom use, particularly in terms of indicators of student proficiency, and tools to support teacher instructional practice?; and (2) In what ways do providing these assessment tasks and rubrics, and supporting teachers in their use, advance teachers' formative assessment practices to support multi-dimensional science instruction? The research and development components of this project will produce assessments and rubrics, which can directly impact students and teachers in the districts and states that have adopted the NGSS, as well as those that have embraced the vision of science teaching and learning embodied in the NRC Framework. The project will consist of five major tasks. First, the effort will iteratively develop assessments and rubrics for formative use, using an evidence-centered design approach. Second, it will collect data from evidence-based revision and redesign of the assessments from teachers piloting the assessments and rubrics, project cognitive laboratory studies with students, and an external review of the assessments design products. Third, it will study teachers' classroom use of assessments to understand and document how they blend assessment and instruction. The project will use pre/post questionnaires, video recordings, observation field notes, and pre/post interviews. Fourth, the study will build the capacity of participating teachers. Teacher Collaborators (n=9) will engage in participatory design of the assessment tasks and act as technical assistants to the overall implementation process. Teacher Implementers (n=15) will use the assessments formatively as part of their instructional practice. Finally, the work will develop a community of learners through the development of a technical assistance infrastructure, and leveraging teacher expertise to formatively assess students' work, using the assessments designed to be diagnostic and instructionally informative. External reviewers and an advisory board will provide formative feedback on the project's processes and summative evaluation of the project's results. The main outcomes of this endeavor will be prototypes of elementary science multi-dimensional assessments and new knowledge for the field on the underlying theory for developing teachers' capacity for engaging in multi-dimensional science instruction, learning, and assessment.<br/><br/>The DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

While the strategy of integrating art and science to promote interest, identity, and other STEM-related learning has grown in recent years, this domain is still nascent with respect to a guiding set of best practices. Through prior work, the team has developed and implemented a set of design principles that incorporate effective practices for broadening participation of girls in science via science-art integration on the topic of the biology, chemistry and optics of ""Colors in Nature."" The continued initiative would impact the ISL field by providing a mechanism for ISL educators in museums, libraries and after-school programs to adopt and implement these STEAM design principles into their work. The team will lead long-term (12-18 months) professional development activities for ISL educators, including: 1) in-person workshops that leverage their four previously developed kits; 2) online, asynchronous learning activities featuring interactive instructional videos around their STEAM design principles; 3) synchronous sessions to debrief content and foster communities of practice; and 4) guided design work around the development or redesign of STEAM activities. In the first four years of the project, the team will work with four core institutional partners (Sitka Sound Science Center, Sno-Isle Libraries, the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District after-school program, and the Pima County Public Library system) across three states (Alaska, Washington, and Arizona). In the project's later stages, they will disseminate their learning tools to a broad, national audience. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. <br/><br/>The project has three main goals: (1) To support ISL educators in offering meaningful STEAM activities, (2) To create institutional change among the partner organizations, and (3) To advance the ISL field with respect to professional development and designing for STEAM Programming. The research questions associated with the professional development activities address the ways in which change occurs and focus on all three levels: individual, institutional, and the ISL field. The methods are qualitative and quantitative, including videotaped observations, pre and post interviews, surveys and analysis of online and offline artifacts. In addition, the project evaluation will assess the implementation of the project's professional development model for effectiveness. Methods will include observations, interviews, surveys and Website analytics and program data."

The new model program will link the resources and learning approaches of the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program to career academies where youth from populations underrepresented in STEM fields will gain direct experiences in data collection and analysis through student-led investigations in the geosciences and environmental studies. Two key outcomes of this project will be: (a) Development of a replicable model of an afterschool STEM internship program for informal STEM learning environments and schools across the nation, and (b) Development of a set of measurement tools and approaches that can assess and promote understanding regarding how youth think and feel about science and their possible future roles in science careers.  Participating youth will master scientific practices and become immersed in science culture through opportunities to develop research projects, interact with scientists, and collaborate with fellow student-researchers. In the process, they will develop collaboration and communication skills, and gain an increased sense of identity and agency in science fields.  They will also learn new strategies to attain their career goals. <br/><br/>In developing and testing the new model of an afterschool program focusing on STEM careers, the project will draw on both existing and emerging knowledge from three areas of inquiry: informal STEM learning, youth development, and work-based learning. The project will bring together theory related to work-based learning and apprenticeship to knowledge about informal STEM learning and youth development, addressing the needs of older youth as they transition to adulthood. The program will also explore the use of measurement tools that address workforce-related student learning goals in addition to social-emotional learning and STEM learning goals, adapting existing tools and developing new tools as needed.  The result will be a replicable model for an afterschool, career-focused internship that facilitates STEM learning and identity, employing youth development principles, such as experiential learning, peer collaboration, adult mentoring, and meaningful contributions to the world beyond school.  The project will use a mixed-methods approach to investigate four research questions:  (1) What aspects of the program are most important for promoting the development of scientific practices, socio-emotional learning, and career skills? (2) How can afterschool informal science learning be designed to address the perceptions and needs of diverse groups, especially those from populations underrepresented in STEM? (3) How do youth make gains in developing facility with STEM practices, key social-emotional outcomes needed in work and civic life, and career development knowledge?  And (4) How do we accurately measure development of scientific practices, socio-emotional learning and career skills?  The project will develop pretest and posttest self-report measures to gauge program influence on social-emotional outcomes and career-related outcomes, and performance-based assessments and rubrics will be used to assess culminating science projects.  Other factors contributing to the success of the new model will be examined through analysis of coach instructional logs, surveys, and questions, as well as participant observations, interviews, and focus groups. Project participants will be youth of ages 14-18 recruited from ten inner-city schools having large populations of students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Participants will meet in teams of approximately 14 interns for a total of 2.5 hours per week for 32 weeks.  Each team will also meet an additional 4-6 times for weekend or overnight outings associated with their study sites."

Over the last decade, there has been a steady decline in the number of women earning bachelor's degrees in computing, with the percentage decreasing from 27.5% in 2002 to 18.2% in 2012, continuing a trend where in some US states no female high school students took the Advanced Placement in CS exam. With the current push to re-introduce CS education into the K-12 schools, there is a great need for carefully developed curriculum materials that introduce high school students to key CS concepts and practices that are also rich and diverse in content that can broaden high school students' perceptions of computing and CS career aspirations coupled together with teacher professional development. The project will mainly take place in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in addition to the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), two of the largest public school districts in the country with high percentages of underserved students. The study also uncovered that high numbers of low-income students of color were offering courses labeled as CS, but their coursework included little other than keyboarding and other basic rudimentary computing skills. Rarely did schools offer rigorous computer science courses, but when they did, they were located in affluent communities and included few girls or students of color. Los Angeles Unified School district (LAUSD) students in ECS reveal high participation rates that closely mirror District demographics. In 2013-14, over 2500 LAUSD students enrolled in ECS; 73% of the students were Latino, 11% African American, 7% Asian, 8% White, and 46% female. There are no other nationwide computer science programs that have attracted such diverse students. <br/><br/>The grant's goals will be (1) to develop robust curricular materials that are accessible to a large group of teachers and students, particularly in underserved communities, (2) to provide evidence that students not only can learn key CS concepts and practices with electronic textiles but also broaden their perspectives of computing and STEM career aspirations, (3) to illustrate an alternative model to competitions for showcasing and disseminating students' final e-textile designs and (4) to pilot teacher professional development. Our interdisciplinary team, versed in addressing issues of equity and diversity in CS, will bring together expertise from curriculum design, computer science, and learning sciences. The CS curriculum will be consisted of six units covering: Human-Computer Interaction, Problem-Solving, Web Design, Introduction to Programming (Scratch), Computing and Data Analysis, and Robotics. The instructional design of the course will adopt inquiry-based teaching practices so that all students are given opportunities to explore, design investigations, think critically, test solutions, and solve real problems. These links to computational thinking will also connect ECS to the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. A key part of ECS will be a professional development (PD) program that builds and supports an on-going teacher learning community. The ECS PD program will spans two years with a combination of two summer week-long institutes and quarterly Saturday workshops. The key features of ECS PD will include: (1) immersion into inquiry and equity-based practices; (2) a focus on teachers' instructional practice done through a teacher-learner-observer model, where teachers take turns planning and delivering lessons in teams with feedback in debrief sessions with fellow teachers; and (3) development of an on-going professional learning. The proposed development of the ECS curriculum and teacher professional development will use electronic textiles with middle and high school students to support their learning of computer science CS concepts and practices and their broadening of perceptions of computing. The project will be leveraged with previous foundational work that developed and piloted introductory and advanced electronic textile activities to introduce CS concepts and practices in line with the existing ECS curriculum to promote computational thinking."

Middle grades are a critical transition point for students, where achievement gaps and interest in STEM-CS widen over time. This project, a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP), is a two-year project that will engage teachers, school leaders, guidance counselors, and researchers to identify barriers and future work in the areas of structural, instructional, and curricular improvements in middle schools to promote more black girls to gain interest and experience in computer science. Some of the core members of the team are developing a computer science learning ecosystem for middle school black girls, called BRIGHT-CS, that includes summer and school based programming. This project is an extension of the BRIGHT-CS project to engage teachers in an RPP to create an inclusive environment to promote CS interest and learning among black girls in their schools. While the core team has had implicit support from schools in the community, there is an exigent need to explicitly engage teachers, guidance counselors, and school leaders to further support an inclusive environment where black girls can thrive at school. The project rests on the foundation that issues of diversity and inclusivity, and broadening participation in computer science specifically, must be systematic, persistent, and ongoing work within the teaching community. Further, the RPP addresses issues around identifying and rectifying barriers in the school that will promote an inclusive school environment that will benefit all students including other marginalized students.<br/><br/>Through the RPP, the project will establish professional learning communities (PLCs) in three middle schools that includes researchers, guidance counselors, teachers and school leaders. The RPP will support the initial steps in addressing why there are so few black girls interested and pursuing computer science in the middle grades. Rather than speaking in general terms, or looking at national trends, the RPP will look specifically at the three schools and classroom data to conduct an equity audit on the structural, instructional, and curricular barriers that black girls face in their school. The result will be a PLC logic model and a research agenda for future RPP proposals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Science fairs are at the intersection of formal learning in school and informal science learning in other settings including science centers, after-school programs, and clubs. However, in spite of their wide implementation and long history, there are few empirical studies that have examined the relationship between student participation in these fairs and their learning and interest in science. Additionally, there have been no studies to understand the real cost of these programs relative to the student benefits. This educational research project will fill that gap in understanding.  It will systematically document and describe science fair models; measure their impact on learning; and provide evidence about the costs of various models and related benefits.  The findings from this study will inform a wide range of stakeholders (including teachers, science fair leaders, volunteers, parents, and businesses) about these models and how they impact students' mastery of science and engineering practices.  <br/>  <br/>This four-year study in all regions of the country will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1 will be a survey of 3800 middle school science teachers will define the characteristics of science fair models; Phase 2 will use those understandings to conduct case studies in 20 schools.  Deliverables include handbooks for teachers and the science fair community, articles in journals summarizing findings, the Science and Engineering Practice and Interest Inventory, and a suite of data collection instruments for scoring rubrics to describe science fairs and measure their impact. Research questions will include:  (1) What are the basic models of middle school science fairs? (2) To what extent does participation in a particular model enhance students' mastery of science and engineering practices and/or their interest in science? (3) What student-teacher and school-level factors contribute to or inhibit students' mastery? (4) What resources, human and financial, are required to implement an effective middle school science fair? and (5) What are the most cost-effective aspects of the science fair experience, and how can they be applied or adapted by science fair leaders and teachers to strengthen students' mastery of science and engineering practices? Findings from this study will have the potential to improve current practices in the design and implementation of science fairs and their impact on student learning; they will be widely disseminated to the various stakeholders through publications, conference presentations, and educational association channels."

Framed around existing inequities in science education, particularly within underserved student populations, the project will aim to investigate how to increase equitable and active participation of diverse students' science learning in middle schools. The central premise of this study will be that building upon and integrating diverse students' funds of knowledge into their learning opportunities would contribute to create equitable access to effective participation. Thus, the study will promote ""authentic scientific discourse"" as a critical feature of students' participation in science practices. In the context of this work, scientific discourse will refer to the spoken and written words, and gestures of students and teachers as they interact in science classrooms. This, in turn, would promote students' science learning at higher levels defined in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013).  <br/><br/>To achieve its goal of supporting authentic scientific discourse in diverse middle school classrooms, the work will address three research questions. (1) What funds of knowledge do students bring to bear, and how can these be productively integrated to support participation in authentic scientific discourse? (2) What are the ways in which students connect cognitively, motivationally, and socially to science learning when participating in authentic scientific discourse within urban classrooms? (3) What progress do students make in key aspects of scientific discourse and their science learning? The study will be conducted across approximately 15 middle schools and will employ a mixed-methods approach with a sample of teachers (n= 18) and students (n= 450). The work will be organized in three phases. Phase 1 will employ mixed methods, longitudinal approach to describe the complex interactions between students' funds of knowledge, disciplinary content and practices of authentic scientific discourse, and connections to science learning. Phase 2 will utilize design-based research cycles with teachers to apply and develop science instructional materials focused on improving opportunities for authentic scientific discourse by integrating students' funds of knowledge in urban classrooms using data from demographics, classroom videos, post-observation student-focus-group interviews, surveys, and science assessments. Phase 3 will focus on dissemination of research and educational findings. The main outcomes of this effort will include scholarly publications, an authentic scientific discourse framework, and instructional materials, such as lessons, videos, and student work for educators.

The main goal of this study will be to conduct exploratory-design work to produce both the design approach and the early-stage tasks that are critical inputs for creating a program of research and development to more fully develop a suite of innovative assessment tasks for the early grades. Specific goals of the effort will be: (1) to iteratively develop and refine a design approach that enables assessment designers to develop Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned tasks and rubrics that include a literacy component for the early grades; (2) to use this design approach to create two exemplar assessment tasks that are feasible for classroom use; and (3) to collect initial evidence that informs the promise of the design approach. <br/><br/>The work's research question will be: How can we extend current methodology to create assessments that integrate the three dimensions of the NGSS and literacy for early learners?

First grade students are typically at a critical point in developing their language and literacy proficiencies, which will allow the team to take on the challenges of variation in language and literacy skills. Correspondingly, the study will select two NGSS first grade life sciences performance expectations, because they include direct ties to literacy practices in science: (1) From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes (Read texts and use media to determine patterns in behavior of parents and offspring that help offspring survive); and (2) Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits (Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like their parents). The design phase of the activity will consist of an assessment of the learning context and targets of the study, and the development of an assessment framework following the National Research Center's report, ""Designing Assessments for the Next Generation Science Standards"" (2014), including the principled assessment evidence-centered-design methodology. Data gathering, and interpretation strategies will include Experts' Review of the design approach, a focus group of teachers (n=8), and one-on-one cognitive interviews with students (n=20), conducted by researchers, which will be recorded to determine the quality and usability of the assessments using qualitative methods.

Embodied cognition research provides promising findings that show how body movement contributes to STEM education by allowing learners to physically engage with ideas, and by describing how teachers naturally use their bodies in ways such as gestures to enhance their instructional effectiveness. Mathematics education, in particular, can benefit from such innovation in embodied cognition because it serves as the connective representational ""language"" across the STEM fields.  Technologies exist now that can track people's movement in real time and provide feedback. Yet there is no current consensus on the best ways to design educational technology for supporting embodied cognition for mathematics education. The timing for motion capture technology, theories of embodied cognition, and interest among teachers for movement based educational innovations is ideal for bringing scholars and classroom practitioners together for a workshop on embodied design for mathematics education. During a 3-day workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the spring of 2019, teachers and research scholars will gather to discuss ways in which  new computer technologies support embodied approaches for improved math education. The workshop participants examine learning in and out of school, but with a focus on the design of systems for promoting embodied ways of learning and teaching in classroom settings.<br/><br/>Embodied design for mathematics education, a research-oriented pedagogical design framework rooted in theories of embodiment and design-based research as practiced within the learning sciences, supports the improvement of instructional methodology for students' mathematical proficiency in the classroom. Currently there is a convergence of theoretical, technological, and methodological developments in formation that make this a particularly promising time to support advancements in embodied design for mathematics education. The workshop will bring research scholars and classroom teachers together in order to achieve four central objectives: (1) synthesize current research into a coherent theory of embodied mathematical imagination and cognition, (2) identify the most promising opportunities for conceptual and methodological integration, (3) curate a set of evidence-based design principles for enhancing mathematics education and broadening participation in all STEM fields, and (4) articulate a future research agenda in the growing area of embodied cognition. This workshop will assemble an interdisciplinary set of scholars from education research, cognitive science, the learning sciences, developmental psychology, movement science, linguistics, computer science, and mathematics. Presentations and discussions will span grades K through 16 on topics in arithmetic and algebra, proportional reasoning and fractions, geometry, complex numbers, statistics, and calculus. The workshop will bring together an intellectually and ethnically diverse group of scholars to synthesize the evidence for embodied design as a means to enhance mathematical reasoning and thereby promote STEM education and participation. The workshop organization will promote interdisciplinary research and theory building in the learning sciences and identify current challenges and future research efforts. The approach is tightly connected to the societal need to foster an educated and technically competent workforce. A particular emphasis on mathematics is intended to broaden participation in math and STEM by creating new entry points for historically underserved ethnic, racial, economic, and gender groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using design-based research, with teachers as design partners, the project will create and refine project-based, hands-on curricula such that science and math content inherent in robotics and related engineering design practices are learned. To provide teachers with effective models to capitalize on robotics for elucidating science and math concepts, a design-based Professional Development program will be built using principles of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). To ensure that teachers are well prepared, research-based practices and features of effective Professional Development will be adopted. Experts in robotics, engineering, education, curriculum design, and assessment--with experience in K-12 education, training, and outreach--have formed an interdisciplinary team to make robotics central to and sustainable in middle school science and math classrooms.<br/><br/>The research questions addressed in this project are qualitative in nature as appropriate for design research questions. The methodologies include teacher needs assessment, teachers' perceptions of robotics, pre and post testing, classroom observations, and surveys. Examples of the research questions are:<br/><br/>What characteristics of robotics  promote effective learning of middle school science and math?<br/><br/>What elements of Professional Development engender teachers' TPACK of robotics and link it with classroom science and math?<br/><br/>What are student prerequisites to effectively use robotics in science and math learning? <br/><br/>What are the gains in students' STEM engagement, interest, persistence, and career awareness? <br/><br/>The robotics curriculum will include physical science used in robot performance expectations and motion stability.  Additionally the curriculum will include the engineering design process consisting of problem definition, solution development, and design improvement. Robotics provides opportunities to support science and engineering practices of the Next Generation Science Standards such as developing and using models, planning and conducting  investigations, designing solutions, and analyzing and interpreting data.  The project will be aimed at middle school students and will provide substantial teacher professional development to implement the new curriculum modules.

This research will contribute to the need to determine how to better educate these students studying science in our country.  There are approximately 2.5 million school-age children with learning disabilities in our nation's schools.  There is a pressing need to ensure that these students graduate high school as science literate individuals who can contribute to society, pursue college education, and advance in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers.  Gaining a better understanding of how students with learning disabilities learn science while creating educational games has the potential to lead to further basic and applied research which may ultimately improve how these students learn science and how teachers can improve their instructional practices to help students better learn science content and skills.<br/><br/>Project leaders at George Mason University will investigate the effort attributions, self-efficacy and self-regulation processes of middle school students with learning disabilities in the areas of science learning and educational game creation.  Students with learning disabilities typically attribute their failures and successes in learning to factors that are external to them, rather than to their own efforts.  Using social cognitive theory as the grounding for their work, the researchers will conduct an exploratory study to examine two primary research questions: 1) How do student effort attributions for learning relate to their perceptions of self-efficacy for serious educational game creation and mastery of science content?  2)  Does intervention result in increased effort attributions that correspond with increased self-efficacy for both serious educational game creation and science learning?   During the first phase of this project students will participate in science learning and educational game creation activities.  During the second phase the first research question will be explored with a group of students to gain preliminary data.  During the final phase the second research question will be studied to gather information about the potential for future research about interventions affecting science learning.  At the completion of the exploratory study, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied educational research about students learning to self-regulate their science learning in the context of educational game generation.   The results of this work are expected to be shared with education researchers and the public in professional publications."

The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in collaboration with the University of Connecticut (UConn), and the Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall), will develop a middle school ecology unit and related teacher professional development that will help high-need and urban middle school students, including English Language Learners, understand these ideas and related practices. Teachers will be supported through professional development that is directly linked to the curriculum and is designed to develop their science content knowledge as well as their knowledge of how to teach the curriculum.  The project builds on existing AMNH resources that include video and text passages supported with literacy strategies, online interactive data tools to plan and carry out investigations, and prior research on these resources used with teachers in professional development and with students in classrooms.  In addition to serving the schools, teachers and students who directly participate, the project's deliverables include the ecology unit, teacher professional development, assessment tools, and a model for designing such comprehensives science programs that relate to NGSS. <br/><br/>The curriculum unit will be modeled after the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) 5E model that will use the 5 Phases (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) for students to work through with each of five themes: Ecological Communities, Food Webs, A River Ecosystem, Zebra Mussel Invasion, and Monitoring Human Impact. Teachers will participate in 12 days of professional development that will introduce the program's pedagogical approach (the 5E model) and how it reflects NGSS, with teachers having significant time to learn the science, try out the activities, learn how to facilitate the program, provide feedback on the program as part of the evaluation, and reflect on their practice.  The initial approach to the curriculum and teacher professional development will be designed in Year 1 and then iteratively revised and evaluated in Years 2-4 through formative evaluation that focuses on curriculum PD, and measures of student and teacher outcomes.  The evaluation will assess the contribution of teacher science and pedagogical knowledge to increases in student knowledge. The evaluation findings and assessment tools developed for the project will provide the foundation for a future efficacy study.

This project will provide such curricular and pedagogical support by developing and evaluating teacher-ready curricular Digital Internship Modules for Engineering (DIMEs). DIMES will be designed to support middle school science teachers in providing students with experiences that require students to use engineering design practices and science understanding to solve a real-world problem, thereby promoting a robust understanding of science and engineering, and motivating students to increased interest in science and engineering.  The modules will also assess students' ability to apply their science knowledge in solving the engineering problem, thereby providing teachers with actionable data about the depth of their students' science and engineering understanding.  The DIMEs will be environments where students work as interns at a simulated engineering firm.  <br/><br/>The Digital Internship Modules for Engineering will provide immersive experiences that simultaneously serve as learning and assessment opportunities. DIMEs will assess not only whether students understand NGSS science and engineering concepts, but also whether they can use them in the context of real-world problem solving. Teachers will orchestrate DIMEs using a custom-designed teacher interface that will show student work, auto-generated assessments, and reports on each student's learning progress. This project will build on prior work on NSF-funded computer-based STEM learning environments called epistemic games. Epistemic games are computer role-playing games that have been successfully used in both undergraduate engineering courses and informal settings for K-12 populations to teach students to think like STEM professionals, thereby preparing them to solve 21st century problems.  The project will create six ten-day activities, two each in Physical Science, Life Science and Earth Science units that are typically taught in middle school.

Yet STEM participation and identification by youth are not equal across social, economic, and cultural communities. This project will study a long-term, out-of-school program for high school-age youth, who are from groups under-represented in STEM academics and careers: girls, youth from low-income households, and youth of color. Located in the urban context of the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC) engages youth in applying culturally rich STEM content to work toward social justice and community building. Specifically, this project will examine how the learning practices of the KAYSC model support youth in identifying with, engaging in, and participating in STEM. Through studying the KAYSC's STEM Justice model, which centers youth as learners, teachers, and leaders who address critical community issues through STEM, this project will develop resources that informal science educators in a variety of contexts and programs can use to promote positive social change, equity, inclusion, and applied STEM learning.<br/><br/>The Science Museum of Minnesota will use design-based implementation research to study this model. This research will draw on and further the emerging theoretical framework of science capital. Science capital attempts to capture multiple aspects of science learning and application, including science knowledge, social and cultural resources, and science-related behaviors and practices. Empirically developing the theory of science capital has the potential to build concrete understanding of how to address inequalities in science participation. Four teams will work independently and collaboratively to do so: an adult research team, a high school youth research team, a practitioner team, and a co-design team composed of representatives from the other three teams. Research teams will collect data in the form of observations, semi-structured interviews, practitioner activity reports, artifacts, and the experience sampling method. Initial cycles of design will occur at the Science Museum of Minnesota as researchers and practitioners document, analyze, and iteratively design learning practices within the STEM Justice model. In the second half of the grant, the team will work with an external out-of-school time youth leadership site to implement the redesigned model. Participatory research and design methods involving both youth and adults can advance understanding of what makes out-of-school time STEM learning meaningful, relevant, and successful for marginalized youth and their communities. Grounded in culturally and socially relevant, community-based resources and programming, this project will study how leveraging STEM out-of-school time learning connected to social justice can broaden access to STEM as well as develop workforce, and leadership, and STEM skills by under-represented youth. The project also builds staff capacity for promoting equity and access in informal learning settings. <br/><br/>This project is being funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This project will build and test a new model for co-created public engagement with science activities in partnership with civic, community, and scientist partners.  The innovation to be tested is deliberative dialogues in science museums that help reduce the polarization about socio-scientific issues, giving people a greater voice in science, and addressing barriers that disconnect scientists from the public.  The project will engage four target audiences (informal science education/ISE professionals, civic, community and scientist partners).  Science museum partners include Museum of Science (MOS) Boston, Oregon Museum of Science, the Michigan Science Center, and the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science.  The project is designed to have a strategic impact on how ISE institutions choose topics of STEM engagement and build public Forum programs.<br/><br/>There will be two evaluation teams for the project.  MOS Research and Evaluation will act as formative evaluation mentors for the four partner sites as they co-create their forums.  They will provide evaluation capacity building for the sites using team-based inquiry as they create and understand the potential impacts and outcomes of the model.  Data collection will include panel surveys and focus groups.  The evaluation will explore how the forums can decrease 1) public polarization around STEM topics and (2) the disconnect between scientists, civic organization, and the public.  The external summative evaluation will be conducted by Rockman et al (REA).  They will conduct a study of the project's process to help the team identify challenges and strategies for overcoming them as they work through the phases of public engagement.  The summative study will focus on the project goals taking a qualitative approach.  Early interviews with partner participants will explore their strengths and weaknesses in taking on this type of public engagement model including the extent of their previous work with civic partners.  Later interviews will investigate what factors have enabled or hindered this project.  Summative evaluation questions will also address changes in attitudes toward public engagement with science.  REA will collect feedback from summit attendees through intercept interviews and post-surveys administered within a week at the event's conclusion to explore the any changes in knowledge or confidence in undertaking this type of model.  REA will present findings from the external evaluation during the annual meeting of the Association of Science-Technology Centers and publish reports to Informalscience.org.  Once the model has been developed and tested it will be disseminated to an initial group of 25-30 science museums and eventually to the entire ISE museum field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will implement an innovative model of citizen-science in which teachers, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals, and middle-high school students from groups underrepresented in STEM work together, applying STEM learning to address environmental issues in their communities (storm water runoff, energy savings from trees). The civic-science nexus, which links STEM with civic contribution, offers unique possibilities for exploring STEM career pathways with students from marginalized communities. Middle- and high-school students will participate as citizen-scientists in place-based investigations into urban ecological issues, working alongside teachers and STEM community partners, to address local environmental issues. Students will develop hypotheses, collect and analyze data during field investigations, build knowledge and skills through supplementary classroom activities, take local stewardship actions, and communicate project results in public forums. Teachers and STEM partners will participate in the professional development (PD) program that trains them in facilitating student inquiry-driven, place-based stewardship projects. They will also share resources on-line, and form a learning community in the process. The aim of the project is to understand the mechanisms whereby local place-based inquiry can build interest in STEM and STEM careers. There is considerable evidence that, for populations underrepresented in STEM, interest and learning increases when connections are made between STEM learning, students' personal interests and their community. However, the potential of interest sparked by these projects may be fleeting unless students are supported in linking the passion they feel to STEM identity pathways they might pursue. <br/><br/>The project will use a mixed methods research strategy to: 1) measure changes in students' STEM career aspirations, interests, and beliefs before and after engaging in environmental work; 2) investigate factors that influence those changes; and 3) assess the impact of randomized interventions that emphasize STEM utility for students' civic goals.  Measures include students' pre-post surveys, reflective essays, and observations of each STEM community partner's field work with students documenting STEM learning and applications. Three STEM professional partners representing different sectors (private company, government, non-government organization) will partner with 18 urban middle-high school classes.  An estimated 720 students from racial/ethnic minority groups underrepresented in STEM will participate in the program and research. The project will disseminate findings via academic venues and by developing outreach materials focusing on best practices and disseminating them to formal and informal educator networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Algebra Project Mathematics Content and Pedagogy Initiative (APMCPI) will scale up, implement and assess the efficacy of interventions in K-12 mathematics education based on the well-established Algebra Project (AP) pedagogical framework. The APMCPI project team is comprised of four HBCUs (Virginia State University, Dillard University, Xavier University, Lincoln University), the Southern Initiative Algebra Project (SIAP), and four school districts that are closely aligned with partner universities. The purpose of the Algebra Project is to improve performance and participation in mathematics by members of students in distressed school districts, particularly those with a large population of low-income students from underserved populations including African American and Hispanics. The project will provide professional development and implement the Algebra Project in four districts and study the impact on student learning. The research results will inform the nation's learning how to improve mathematics achievement for all children, particularly those in distressed inner-city school districts. <br/><br/>The study builds on a prior pilot project with a 74% increase in students who passed the state exam. In the early stages of this project, teachers in four districts closely associated with the four universities will receive Algebra Project professional development in Summer Teacher Institutes with ongoing support during the academic year, including a community development plan.  The professional development is designed to help teachers combine mathematical problem solving with context-rich lessons, which both strengthen and integrate teachers' understanding of key concepts in mathematics so that they better engage their students. The project also will focus on helping teachers establish a framework for mathematically substantive, conceptually-rich and experientially-grounded conversations with students. The first year of the study will begin a longitudinal quasi-experimental, explanatory, mixed-method design. Over the course of the project, researchers will follow cohorts who are in grade-levels 5 through 12 in Year 1 to allow analyses across crucial transition periods - grades 5 to 6; grades 8 to 9; and grades 12 to college/workforce. Student and teacher data will be collected in September of Project Year 1, and in May of each project year, providing five data points for each student and teacher participant. Student data will include student attitude, belief, anxiety, and relationship to mathematics and science, in addition to student learning outcome measures. Teacher data will include content knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and practices. Qualitative data will provide information on the implementation in both the experimental and control conditions. Analysis will include hierarchical linear modeling and multivariate analysis of covariance."

The project aims to promote understanding of the conditions under which racial minorities, persons with disabilities, and persons with low SES are full participants in STEM fields.  This effort is consistent with broader NSF goals of broadening participation and expanding efforts to increase participation from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Youth in these underrepresented groups have lower average levels of achievement and face cultural and socioemotional barriers to STEM-positive attitudes and choices. This project advances knowledge by incorporating a focus on structural and institutional contributors as well as individual attitudes and choices, and by moving beyond establishing disparities to quantifying factors most closely implicated in STEM disparities.<br/><br/>This project's research efforts will use quasi-experimental techniques to analyze data on over 23,000 9th graders from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 to answer these questions: 1) How do 9th graders' STEM potential and STEM learning environments vary at the intersection of race, SES, and disability status? 2) Which student, classroom, and school characteristics contribute the most to disparities by race, SES, and disability status in STEM outcomes? 3) Which classroom and school characteristics improve STEM outcomes for students who began high school with similar levels of STEM potential? Measures describing students, courses, parents, teachers, and schools enable a nuanced consideration of STEM potential and potential confounders.

The DRK-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by PreK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of STEM education innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The fundamental purpose of this project is to develop, implement, and study a professional development (PD) model for improving chemistry teachers' formative assessment practices to foster teaching focused on chemical thinking. The PD model seeks to refocus and enhance teachers' abilities to notice, interpret, and respond to students' ideas. Building on previous exploratory work through which a Chemical Thinking Framework was developed, the proposed effort will work with 8th-12th grade teachers in Boston Public Schools and the New England Region to assist them (a) to recognize tools that are useful in eliciting students' chemical thinking, and adapt or design formative assessments; (b) to make sense of students' chemical thinking based on data collected using formative assessments that elicit students' thinking; and (c) to strategize responsive actions that better foster learning chemistry. The research questions will be: (1) How does chemistry teachers' assessment reasoning change through engagement in PD that focuses on formative assessment as a transformative lever?; and (2) How does engagement in the proposed PD activities influence the ideas and practices that teachers emphasize in their classrooms?<br/><br/>In order to address the research questions, the project will develop a yearlong PD model with four cohorts of 8th-12th grade teachers, including one cohort with teachers from the New England region in a hybrid format (face-to-face and online); each having six teachers (N=24). The model development will be conducted in three phases. In Phase 1, the research team will develop a detailed plan for the PD program by designing and testing conceptualized activities. During Phase 2, the project will study the model with Cohorts 1 and 2 teachers. Phase 3 will focus on positioning the model for scaling up purposes with Cohorts 3 and 4. This phase will test the resources developed, and make comparisons to assess the scalability of the model. Data gathering strategies will include: (a) focus groups to collect data on teachers' assessment reasoning while collectively analyzing students' written work and videos of assessment practice; (b) assessment portfolios to gather individual data on teacher assessment reasoning and practice; (c) assessment snapshots to capture individual teachers' interactions with students; and (d) follow-up sessions to observe and videotape teachers during the year. Data interpretation strategies will include: (a) analysis of domain-neutral factors to characterize changes in how teachers frame and approach assessment of student understanding; and (b) analysis of domain-dependent factors to characterize changes in teachers' attention to the disciplinary ideas of students' work according to the Chemical Thinking Framework. The project will include an external evaluator to address both formative and summative components of this process. The outcome of the proposed scope of work will be a research-informed and field-tested PD model focused on the use of formative assessment to improve chemistry teaching and learning."

Good problem based learning environments provide support for the solution of complex and ill-structured problems. The combination of these two types of learning environments promise to provide the engagement and richness of game based learning with the support environment to engage students in authentic science. Both of these environments are computer based so the actions and interactions of the students and teachers are captured for analysis. Applying learning analytics to the captured data provides information on student learning for the teacher, provides learning information to the student for self-reflection and improved learning, and provides information for the system designer to improve the effectiveness of the new CSCL environment.<br/><br/>The scientific problem domain is environmental science for middle school students. The CSCL environment is a  game based learning environment that incorporates problem based learning. The interaction between the CSCL environment and the student is enhanced by the collection of data on the student based on cognitive, affective, and metacognitive states that are inferred using artificial intelligence technologies. Specific strategies are employed to help students construct explanagions, reason effectively, and become self-directed learners. Key outcomes of the project include a model of collaborative scaffolding for game based learning that is usable in classrooms to help students learn STEM content and learning analytics designed to support the teacher in the roles of guide and collaborator.

This study will address two core research questions in the area of STEM Workforce Development: Are there gender and racial/ethnic disparities in STEM faculty hiring? If so, what conditions, processes and social contexts generate/mitigate these disparities? The researchers will conduct a systematic theory-driven evaluation of the faculty hiring process by compiling an unprecedented dataset on faculty hiring across ten research-intensive universities. The data will be used to test hypotheses about how gender and race/ethnicity influence applications for faculty positions, evaluation of applicants, and outcomes at multiple stages in the faculty hiring process. By identifying the steps in the hiring process that are most susceptible to bias and the characteristics of the hiring process that amplify/mitigate disparities, this study will identify the most important targets for policy interventions aimed at increasing equity and diversity in faculty hiring.<br/><br/>The study will be framed by expectation states theory, which explains how status beliefs (widely shared beliefs that people in one category of a status-based social distinction, such as gender or race, are more socially worthy and competent than those in another category) influence interpersonal interactions, evaluations of self and others, and individual and group behavior to generate and reinforce social inequality. The researchers will construct and use a unique dataset from an online administrative system that compiles information from all faculty recruitments at all University of California campuses. This rich data source includes detailed information on applicant pools, applicant credentials and achievements, hiring processes and committees, and candidates? progression from application through the short list, interview, and offer steps in the process. The richness of the administrative data will be enhanced using automated text analytic tools to generate a dataset that provides large sample sizes, detailed measurement of key variables, links to supplemental data sources that provide measures of influential factors (e.g., institutional prestige), and observable variation in factors which theory predicts affect bias in faculty hiring. Multilevel statistical models will be used to accurately identify and disentangle the influences operating at the faculty search-level versus those operating at the applicant-level to affect the faculty hiring process. Analyses will be disaggregated by STEM discipline, gender, detailed race/ethnicity and race-by-gender categories."

There is a need to connect mathematics to real world contexts and problems. In the game-based architectural simulation, students will be able to complete tasks such as building and constructing structures while using mathematics and problem solving. The learning platform will be flexible so teachers can customize tasks for their students. The project will examine how to collect data about students' learning from data generated as they play the game. The project will explore how students learn mathematics using the simulation and how the simulation can be included in middle school mathematics learning. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The project includes two major research questions. First, how will the design of a scalable game-based, design-centered learning platform promote coordination and application of math representation for problem solving? Second, how and under what implementation circumstances will using a scalable architectural game-based learning platform improve students multi-stranded mathematical proficiency (i.e., understanding, problem solving and positive disposition)? A key feature of the project is stealth-assessment or data collected and logged as students use the architectural simulation activities that can be used to understand their mathematics learning. The project uses a design-based research approach to gather data from students and teachers that will inform the design of the learning environment. The qualitative and quantitative data will also be used to understand what students are learning as they play the game and how teachers are interacting with their students. The project will include a mixed methods study to compare classrooms using the architectural activities to classrooms that are using typical activities."

The new curriculum and associated online tools will promote development of critical competencies among students in the context of bioscience career-related investigations.  The project will also develop a web-based application that will enable remotely located classrooms to participate in the new curriculum, develop new professional development approaches for high school teachers to support implementation of the new curriculum, and produce research data that will expand the knowledge base on factors influencing  career selection and persistence among students with respect to bioscience careers.  The curriculum will engage students in simulations that involve designing experiments, predicting results, and interpreting data.  Video vignettes of bioscience professionals will be embedded in the curriculum to raise awareness of the wide range of careers related to the bioscience simulations.  The associated teacher professional development will engage teachers in co-designing learning activities, piloting activities with students during summer activities, and an ongoing mentoring process with both in-person and virtual components. <br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort involving scientists, educational researchers, and computer programmers from the Center for Translational Science Education at the Tufts University School of Medicine and teachers and biotech researchers in the Boston metropolitan area.  The curricular approach being implemented and tested combines four strategies that have been shown to increase active learning, self-efficacy, and career awareness among students, and to effectively support teacher implementation of new curricula:  a) Collaborative problem-based learning strategies that build career awareness by modeling how workforce teams collaborate in inquiry to solve authentic problems; b) Use of collaborative learning technologies that engage students and teachers in modeling, social persuasion, and problem-solving activities to foster teamwork and shared decision-making; c) A collaborative curriculum design process that engages teacher in developing curricula; and d) A teacher professional development approach that progresses through a series of in-person and virtual experiences that support teacher learning before, during, and after implementation of the new curriculum.   A mixed methods research approach will be used to examine student outcomes related to disciplinary content knowledge and practices, student self-efficacy and outcome expectations, interests, and career goals.  Pretest data and posttest data from innovation and comparison groups will be analyzed using multivariate techniques to examine relationships among outcome measures."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  The team of Associated Universities Inc. (AUI), Michigan State University (MSU), California Academy of Science (the Academy), Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), will bring together experts in astronomy, STEM education, and planetarium show production. This work will tell the story of the people and places that make ""big astronomy"" possible, particularly the search for exoplanets and understanding of how planets form. The show and related materials will be presented in dozens of venues around the USA and internationally. Through a planetarium show and learning experiences that extend beyond the theater, the team will take visitors to extreme sites of the NSF ground-based observatories on the mountains of Chile and meet the diverse people who enable amazing discoveries in astronomy. In addition, the project develops the Dome+ model, which ensures engagement does not end with the planetarium. Dome+ will include additional content, weekly virtual sessions with STEM professionals, and a suite of closely linked outreach activities.<br/><br/>Dome+ will serve as a model to extend engagement and increase the impact of future planetarium shows. Project goals include 1) increasing awareness of the research in astronomy being made at the NSF-funded observatories in Chile, 2) increasing awareness and interest in diverse STEM career opportunities at large observatories and related institutions in the USA, 3) increasing knowledge of science enabled by big observatories, 4) increasing Latinx perceptions as someone who can have a career at a major observatory, and 5) developing the Dome+ model and identify best practices for implementation.  Iterative and summative evaluation of the project by collaborators at MSU will address four main questions: How does the Dome+ model affect visitors' perceptions of diversity of careers in STEM? How does the Dome+ model affect visitors' interest and understanding of Chile as an ideal observing location for astronomy? How does the Dome+ model support visitors' interest and understanding of the science of exoplanets? How do planetariums implement Dome+, and how does implementation affect the outcomes for visitors?  The impact assessment component of this project takes places in four phases. The goals of the first phase are to leverage the expertise of the research team to inform the creation of the planetarium show and to set up a robust research agenda to be achieved in Years 2-4 of the project. The goals of the second phase are to collect preliminary data from visitors on their responses to planetarium show content and to use this information to advise on edits to the show and to develop the content and format of the web-portal and educational materials. The goal of the third phase is to then collect data on how effectively the technology-rich environments of the three components of the Dome+ model (planetarium show, web-portal, educational materials) work in concert to reach the intended goals of changing visitors' perceptions of diversity in STEM, engaging visitors with astronomy content on exoplanets, and exposing visitors to the wonders of astronomy research in Chile. The goal of the fourth phase is to perform data analysis, synthesize findings and make recommendations for future implementations of the Dome+ model for practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many benefits to community-driven STEM projects, both for individuals' experiential learning and for the betterment of communities. Expanding participation also contributes to a more complete understanding of complex environmental problems, including STEM content and skills. This project engages members of racially and economically diverse communities in identifying and carrying out environmental projects that are meaningful to their lives, and adapts technology known as NatureNet to assist them. NatureNet, which encompasses a cell phone app, a multi-user, touch-based tabletop display and a web-based community, was developed with prior NSF support. Core participants involved in programs of the Anacostia Watershed Society in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, and the Reedy Creek Nature Preserve in Charlotte, NC, will work with naturalists, educators, and technology specialists to ask scientific questions and form hypotheses related to urban waterway restoration and preservation of native species. They will then collect and analyze data using NatureNet, requesting changes to the technology to customize it as needed for their projects. Casual visitors to the nature centers will be able to interact with the environmental projects via the tabletop, and those who live farther away will be able to participate more peripherally via the online community. This study is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The research project, led by researchers from the University of Maryland, College Park,  with collaborators from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, will provide answers to two questions: 1) How do community-driven informal environmental learning projects impact participants, including their motivation to actively participate in science issues via technology and their disposition toward nature preserves and scientific inquiry, and 2) What are the key factors (e.g., demographic composition of participants, geographical location) that influence the development of community-driven environmental projects? Researchers will gather extensive qualitative and quantitative data to understand how community projects are selected and carried out, how participants approach technology use and adaptation, and how informal learning and engagement on STEM-related issues can be fostered over a period of several months and through iterative project cycles. Data will be collected through motivation questionnaires; focus groups; interviews; tabletop, mobile, and website interaction logs; field notes from participatory design and reflection sessions; and project journals kept by nature preserve staff. Through extensive research, iterative design, and evaluation efforts, researchers will develop an innovative model for community-driven environmental projects that will deepen informal science education by demonstrating how members of diverse communities connect environmental knowledge and scientific inquiry skills to the practices, values, and goals of their communities, and how technology can be used to facilitate such connections."

This project will examine this interaction involving the use of gestures that represent how individuals work with systems and large data sets that represent complex systems like the oceans, to understand how basic elements of a project with a 3-D type of design might enhance the user experience and increase the utility and learning that takes place by understanding the cognitive elements of these game like interactions in specific STEM related settings like museums.<br/><br/>This exploratory pathways project will investigate the use of interactive, gesture-enabled, multi-touch spheres for teaching about ocean systems in science centers and museums. The gesture-enabled aspect of the project will improve on interactive table-top installations which can frustrate users who use unexpected gestures and receive no response leading to brief interaction and abandonment without significant interaction or learning. The project will investigate ways in which unsupported gestures would still produce a system response which would encourage the user to remain at the installation and continue to investigate.  The effect of multiple gestures will be supported by using natural mappings between gestures and interactions with the on-sphere data. <br/><br/>The project investigates theories of embodied cognition that support the notion that by engaging with global-scale datasets on a spherical display more effectively models the earth in a non-distorted manner and therefore will be more natural and allow users to develop a more accurate conceptual model of how data relates to itself and the globe.

The project will advance science (physics) identity research by testing research-based approaches/interventions with larger groups of teachers and connecting research to practice in ways that are both widely deployable and practical for teachers to implement. The project will also affect female participation in engineering since developing a physics identity is strongly related to choosing engineering. The core area teachers will be trained in addressing student identity as a physicist or engineer.<br/><br/>In this project, two research universities (Florida International University, Texas A&M-Commerce) and the two largest national organizations in physics (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) will work together using approaches/interventions drawn from prior research results that will be tested with teachers in three states (24 teachers, 8 in each state) using an experimental design with control and treatment groups. The project proposes three phases: 1. Refine already established interventions for improving female physics identity for use on a massive national level which will be assessed through previously validated and reliable surveys and sound research design; 2. Launch a massive national campaign involving workshops, training modules, and mass communication approaches to reach and attempt to mobilize 16,000 of the 27,000 physics teachers nationwide to attract and recruit at least one female student to physics using the intervention approaches refines in phase 1 and other classroom approaches shown to improve female physics identity; and 3. Evaluate of the success of the campaign through surveys of high school physics teachers (subjective data) and data from the Higher Education Research Institute to monitor female student increases in freshmen declaring a physics major during the years following the campaign (objective data). The interventions will focus on developing female students' physics identity, a construct which has been found to be strongly related to career choice and persistence in physics. The project has the potential to reduce or eliminate the gender gap in the field of physics. In addition, the increase in female physics identity is likely to also increase female representation in engineering majors. Therefore, the work will lay the groundwork for adapting similar methods for increasing under-representation of females in other disciplines. The societies involved (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) are uniquely positioned within the discipline to ensure a successful campaign of information dissemination to physics teachers nationally and under-representation of females in other disciplines as well, engineering specifically."

The project will work toward identifying and addressing the factors which influence Latinas' levels of engagement in pursuing STEM education throughout their high school years. These factors will include (a) accessibility to STEM learning opportunities; (b) language issues that affect their participation in these activities; (c) level of family or community encouragement to pursue STEM education; and (d) financial pressures, such as providing support for the family or child care. The project team consists of Randolph-Macon College, which serves as the backbone organization, working together with a group of STEM-focused Fortune 500 corporations and nonprofits, as well as state and local government and local public-school systems. The program will identify promising students during their freshman year of high school based on recommendation from a teacher and a written essay. Selected students will be invited to campus for each of three consecutive summers (after the freshman, sophomore, and junior years) where they will participate in targeted activities. These activities will be designed to accomplish several goals: (a) to create a cohesive cohort with an identity embracing intellectual interdisciplinary STEM enquiry; (b) to develop and nurture leadership skills; (c) to expose the cohort to prominent successful Latinas in STEM fields; and (d) to develop skills leading to success in applying to and persisting in a college environment. Synergistic activities will be included for these students and their families to extend the goals into the academic year. At the conclusion of each summer, students will earn modest scholarships to an accredited institution of their choice.<br/><br/>The research questions will be (1) How does engagement, including attitudes, interest in STEM disciplines, and interest in pursuing college education in STEM change for the target population, compared to initial measures of these constructs?; (2) To what extent do partnerships with STEM-focused corporations and nonprofits account for change in engagement observed in participant cohorts?; and (3) To what extent does parental involvement and other external factors account for an observed engagement change in the focus population? To answer these questions, the project will use multiple data collection pathways, including (a) the Student Attitudes Toward STEM (S-STEM) Survey, which measures changes in confidence and efficacy in STEM subjects, 21st century learning skills and interest in STEM careers; (b) pre- and post-camp surveys, which measure interest in STEM topics, and family engagement; and (c) observational assessments of engagements with family members. The focus population will consist of Latinas. The project will follow one third of the population for five years, one third for four years, and one third for three year to collect pertinent data past the end of the funding period to follow the entire cohort through the second year after graduation from high school. Data interpretation strategies will include longitudinal-trend analysis of engagement change and explanatory analysis of the factors that contribute to that change. The main outcome of the project will be the identification of factors that are associated with a successful Latina's pathway from high school to college. The project will conduct formative and summative evaluation to make improvements and adjustments to the program, as well as to determine potential scalability of the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, most work at the intersection of computer science education and physiological computing focuses on using physiological technology to augment learning experiences or predict performance. There is a lack of research investigating ways to enable K-12 students in acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to design and build future technologies and applications that leverage physiological sensors. This project will design, develop, and implement an educational physiological computing learning tool, and evaluate the tool's impact on upper secondary student's acquisition of computational thinking skills. The proposed work will provide the computer science education community field with foundational research on how best to leverage novel physiological sensing technologies within K-12 education. In addition to contributing findings to the broader research community, the PI team will build a summer outreach program that exposes high school students from the Alabama Black-Belt (ABB) to novel brain-computer interface sensing technologies. As a result of the powerful innovation and application of computing in STEM disciplines, the STEM+C program supports research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. This pilot project will advance the integration of physiological sensing and data processing with computational thinking.<br/><br/>Researchers will use a user-centered approach to identify effective designs for educational physiological computing tools. This includes studies that address knowledge gaps related to students' and educators' attitudes and understandings of novel physiological computing technology. Researchers will conduct semi-structured user interviews with Alabama Black Belt Exploring Computer Science (ECS) students and educators to advance knowledge regarding their perceptions and mental models of physiological sensing technologies. Insights gained from these interviews will inform the iterative design of pilot low-fidelity prototypes. Qualitative and quantitative data on students' experiences with each prototype will be collected during user experiments. Feedback gained during the low-fidelity prototype studies will guide the development of design solutions. The project will employ hybrid computer programming approaches such as data-flow and block-based programming for the learning tool development. User studies with students will be used to evaluate the tool influence on students' patterns of computational practice including incremental and iterative programming, testing and debugging, abstracting and modularization, computational perspectives of expressing and questioning, and knowledge of physiological computing systems. This project will contribute a web-based educational physiological computing tool designed for K-12 education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The problem, the spread of infectious disease, specifically influenza, was chosen for the local community (Coconino County, AZ) after consultation with community partners. The project emanates from efforts in education designed to develop the next generation of STEM innovators who can productively participate in our increasingly global society. Developing the next generation of STEM innovators will be difficult as only 62% of Arizona high-school sophomores passed Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards in Mathematics (AIMS) and only 40% of those sophomores passed the Science AIMS. At the same time, the disaggregation of this data shows the achievement gap between students of underserved populations and Caucasian students continues to grow significantly in both areas. Locally, industry and community leaders in Coconino County and the City of Flagstaff have shared similar concerns. For instance, the Flagstaff business community has recognized the compelling need for an increased and better-educated workforce by initiating the Flagstaff STEM Consortium in August 2012, which named Flagstaff ""America's 1st STEM Community"". While Flagstaff has numerous STEM professionals in all fields, and many have presented to local students, there is a clear need for more meaningful and sustainable connections between students and STEM businesses and agencies in order to increase student motivation and interest in STEM learning and careers. The iCREATE project directly addresses the STEM workforce problem at a regional level. In addition, the project specifically targets the underrepresentation of students of color in the STEM workforce. The courses provided by CAVIAT, including the bioscience courses in this project, serve the diverse population of Coconino County. <br/><br/>The project ensures a high-quality STEM workforce for Flagstaff and Northern Arizona, which is designed to 1) increases student awareness of career opportunities in STEM and cognate fields at all levels (technicians, scientists, engineers, etc.), 2) motivates students to pursue appropriate educational pathways to STEM related careers, and 3) provides a technology-rich experience that develops disciplinary knowledge, practices, and non-cognitive skills needed for STEM fields. In addition, with a focus on engaging Native American students across the region, the project will broaden participation of students underrepresented in STEM-related domains. This will occur through a focus on effective experiences that foster student competency, innovative curricular models, the role of business and workforce members, and engaging diverse underrepresented populations. The ultimate goal of the iCREATE project will be to positively impact the regional STEM workforce through the implementation of a new model of community engagement in STEM learning. To accomplish this goal, the project will be designed to meet the following objectives: 1. Test and refine a model of community engagement in STEM learning to engage students in finding solutions to authentic, community-based problems; 2. Engage community partners to design and implement a technology-rich bioscience course focusing on infectious disease and its data collection challenges; 3. Increase student motivation and interest in STEM learning and careers; and 4. Integrate sustainability into the project for a long lasting impact in the community. This bioscience course will be designed to engage students in an authentic problem important to the local community while drawing upon community resources. It will integrate the study of relevant bioscience topics and epidemiological principles with the technological project of designing and implementing a data collection system using computer and geospatial technologies software in order to monitor the transmission of influenza. Project partners include: The Center for Science Teaching and Learning at Northern Arizona University, Translational Genomics Research Institute North (TGen-North), Flagstaff STEM city, multiple regional health care providers and the Coconino Association for Vocations, Industry and Technology (CAVIAT), a local provider of career and technical education courses."

Such interdisciplinary teaching and learning must be developed with the understanding of the needs and capacity of elementary school teachers and their students, and appropriate grade-specific integration in the elementary curriculum. This exploratory research will study the landscape of K-5 elementary teachers and how they engage students in computational thinking, and apply concepts associated with computing and computational thinking in their teaching of STEM content so implementation efforts are viable. By better understanding how computational thinking concepts and approaches integrate authentically into math, science and other subjects, policymakers and district leaders will be informed of how to intentionally support teachers and students to develop their core skills that will provide a strong foundation for computing applications in STEM teaching and learning. Outcomes of the research will include a better understanding of computational thinking concepts and approaches across the K-5 curriculum to inform future implementation efforts; increased awareness of computational thinking definitions for K-5 teachers so teachers are more prepared to apply computing in their practice; and inform the professional development needs of K-5 teachers. Findings will support computational integration in STEM education in elementary school built on evidence and best practices. This project was submitted to the DRK12-STEM+C DCL (17-149) and is supported by the STEM+C Program that focuses on research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>Through a convergent parallel mixed methods design, survey data will be collected concurrently with Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) activity artifacts and merged (1) to provide a holistic picture of how computational thinking (CT) concepts and approaches are currently being addressed in elementary classrooms and (2) to identify how new CT concepts and approaches in computing programs relate to those already applied in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

Multiple correlation coefficient (R) and HLM statistical analysis of teacher survey data will explain where and when CT concepts and approaches are present in the current elementary classroom. By including educators and researchers from across the STEM+C fields, as well as including schools from urban, rural, and suburban areas, the project will explore what works and for whom. As the project is concerned with supporting and sustaining systemic change, the project's long-term sustainability goals will benefit from the infrastructure developed through an NSF Local Systemic Change grant that has matured over the past 20 years. The relationships between the University and 12 local school districts, as well as mechanisms for communication will be a key factor in the sustainability of the project. The research and activities will result in the dissemination of a multimedia model for interdisciplinary computing. The model will inform further research on the development and implementation of teaching computing as an integral, embedded component of STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This understanding requires deep thinking about complex causality, unintended side-effects, and the strengths and limitations of experimental science. These are difficult concepts to learn due to the many interacting components and non-linear interrelationships involved. Ecosystems dynamics is particularly difficult to teach in classrooms because ecosystems involve complexities such as phenomena distributed widely across space that change over long time frames. Learning when and how experimental science can provide useful information in understanding ecosystems dynamics requires moving beyond the limited affordances of classrooms. The project will: 1) advance understanding of experimentation in ecosystems as it can be applied to education; 2) show how student learning is affected by having opportunities to experiment in the virtual world that simulate what scientists do in the real world and with models; and 3) produce results comparing this form of teaching to earlier instructional approaches. This project will result in a learning environment that will support learning about the complexities of the earth's ecosystem. <br/><br/>The project will build upon a computer world called EcoMUVE, a Multi-User Virtual Environment or MUVE, developed as part of an earlier NSF-funded project. A MUVE is a simulated world in which students can virtually walk around, make observations, talk to others, and collect data. EcoMUVE simulates a pond and a forest ecosystem. It offers an immersive context that makes it possible to teach about ecosystems in the classroom, allowing exploration of the complexities of large scale problems, extended time frames and and multiple causality. To more fully understand how ecosystems work, students need the opportunity to experiment and to observe what happens.  This project will advance this earlier work by developing ways for students to conduct experiments within the virtual world and to see the results of those experiments. The project will work with ecosystem scientists to study the types of experiments that they conduct, informing knowledge in education about how ecosystem scientists think, and will build opportunities for students that mirror what scientists do. The project will develop a modified virtual world and accompanying curriculum for middle school students to help them learn to more deeply understand ecosystems patterns and the strengths and limitations of experimentation in ecosystems science. The resulting program will be tested against existing practice, the EcoMUVE program alone, and other programs that teach aspects of ecosystems dynamics to help teachers know how to best use these curricula in the classroom.<br/><br/>."

This project examines the conditions in which families and young learners most benefit from ""doing science and math"" together among a population that is typically underserved with respect to STEM experiences--families experiencing poverty. This project builds on an existing program called Teaching Together that uses interactive parent-child workshops led by a museum educator and focused on supporting STEM learning at home. The goal of these workshops is to increase parents'/caregivers' self-perception and ability to serve as their child's first teacher by supporting learning and inquiry conversations during daily routines and informal STEM activities. Families attend a series of afternoon and evening workshops at their child's preschool center and at a local children's museum. Parents/Caregivers may participate in online home learning activities and museum experiences. The project uses an experimental design to test the added value of providing incremental supports for informal STEM learning. The study uses an experimental design to address potential barriers parents/caregivers may perceive to doing informal STEM activities with their child. The project also explores how the quantity and quality parent-child informal learning interactions may relate to changes in children's science and mathematics knowledge during the pre-kindergarten year. The project partners include the Children's Learning Institute at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Children's Museum of Houston. <br/><br/>The project is designed to increase understanding of how parents/caregivers can be encouraged to support informal STEM learning by experimentally manipulating key aspects of the broader expectancy-value-cost motivation theory, which is well established in psychology and education literatures but has not been applied to preschool parent-child informal STEM learning. More specifically, the intervention conditions are designed to identify how specific parent supports can mitigate potential barriers that families experiencing poverty face. These intervention conditions include: modeling of informal STEM learning during workshops to address skills and knowledge barriers; materials to address difficulties accessing science and math resources; and incentives as a way to address parental time pressures and/or costs and thereby improve involvement in informal learning activities. Intervention effects will be calculated in terms of effect sizes and potential mediators of change will be explored with structural equation modeling. The first phase of the project uses an iterative process to refine the curriculum and expand the collection of resources designed for families of 3- to 5-year-olds. The second phase uses an experimental study of the STEM program to examine conditions that maximize participation and effectiveness of family learning programs. In all, 360 families will be randomly assigned to four conditions: 1) business-as-usual control; 2) the Teaching Together core workshop-based program; 3) Teaching Together workshops + provision of inquiry-based STEM activity kits for the home; and 4) Teaching Together workshop + activity kits + provision of monetary incentives for parents/caregivers when they document informal STEM learning experiences with their child. The interventions will occur in English and Spanish. A cost analysis across the interventions will also be conducted. This study uses quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data sources include parent surveys and interviews, conversation analysis of home learning activities, parent photo documentation of informal learning activities, and standardized assessments of children's growth in mathematics, science, and vocabulary knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers will explore the design and development of a 3D puzzle-based game, called May's Journey, in which players solve an environmental maze by using the game's pseudo code to manipulate game objects. The game is designed to teach introductory but foundational concepts of computer programming including abstraction, modularity, reusability, and debugging by focusing players on logic and concepts while asking them to type simple instructions in a simplified programming language designed for novices. The game design in this project differs from today's block-based programming learning approaches that are often too far from actual computer code, and also differs from professional programming languages which are too complex for novices. The game and its embedded programming language learning are designed to be responsive to the progress of the learner throughout the game, transitioning from pseudo code to the embedded programming language itself. Error messages for debugging are also designed to be adaptive to players' behavior in the game. Using extensive log data collected from people playing the game, researchers can study how people learn computer programming. Such knowledge can advance understanding of the learning processes in computer programming education. Additionally, this work emphasizes the use of games as informal learning environments as they are accessible and fun, drawing attention and retention of many learners of different age groups with the potential to change attitudes towards computer programming across different populations. This project is co-funded by the STEM + Computing (STEM+C) program that supports research and development to understand the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM learning, and the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings with its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>The project's formative and summative evaluation methods, including surveys, expert reviews of learners' computer code developed in the game, and interviews, are used to gauge learners' engagement as well as learning. In exploring learning, researchers aim to understand how players build implicit computer science knowledge through gameplay and how that gameplay relates to their performance on external transfer tasks. The project will answer the following three research questions: (1) Can observers reliably detect and label patterns of gameplay that provide evidence of learning or misconceptions regarding the four computer science constructs - abstraction, modularity, debugging and semantics - that learners exhibit playing May's Journey? (2) How does learner's implicit knowledge of these computer science constructs change over time and do those patterns vary by gender and prior programming experiences? (3) Is there a strong correlation between implicit learning measures and transfer of CS concepts: modularity, debugging, semantics, and abstraction? How do these correlations vary across elements of the game? This work will result in several outcomes: game design metaphors tested for their learning and engagement value that can be abstracted and embedded in different games. This project will also contribute patterns and an understanding of how people learn and engage in problem solving using concepts of abstraction, modularity, debugging and semantics. These outcomes will lead to advancement in knowledge in the learning sciences as well as the design of educational games that enrich STEM learning, particularly in programming and computational thinking. In addition, this project will engage female participants and underserved populations through partnering organizations including National Girls Collaborative project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team will develop curricular materials, based on the Beauty and Joy of Computing course developed at University of California-Berkeley, for teaching Computer Science Principles at the high school level using the Snap! programming language. They will run in-person teacher-training programs each summer, and develop an online teacher development course. During the project, 100 high school teachers in New York City will be trained to teach this course, and early participants will also become teacher-trainers who will work with later participants. The teachers involved will become part of a Community of Practice that will continue to provide support for the teacher cohorts.<br/><br/>This project is a design and development study.  The central research hypothesis is that the explanatory power of a visual programming language can make advanced techniques such as recursion and higher order functions accessible to high school students, including traditionally underrepresented groups. The project team also hopes to show that students completing this Computer Science (CS) Principles course will be motivated and well prepared to succeed in later courses, such as the Advanced Placement (AP) CS A course.  They will use the knowledge gained from this experience in New York City (NYC) to improve the course through iterative development and refinement and to increase understanding of the implementation of these ideas in high school contexts more broadly.  Formative data will be collected throughout the project and analyzed, and used to inform subsequent revisions to the curriculum materials. They will use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods analysis approaches. Over the four years of the project, the project team will work with the 100 teachers who will participate in the project, attend professional development activities, and teach the CS Principles course to a total of approximately 2,000 students in NYC. Evaluation instruments will include background surveys, feedback surveys, course assessments, the AP CS Principles exam (currently under development by the College Board), classroom observations, student interest and engagement assessments, student papers, and teacher interviews.  All 100 NYC teachers involved will be part of the research study."

Media narratives can shape opinions and knowledge about STEM as well as either reduce or enhance cultural biases and perceptions of STEM.  However, little is known about the process by which STEM media professionals develop and assess mastery of ""STEM Media,"" or to what extent evidence-based communication strategies and data-supported effective practices are considered and used by creators of STEM media.  This conference proposal will bring together STEM professionals and media creators to determine how STEM media makers develop and assess expertise in STEM media making and articulate best practices.  The goal is to promote cross-industry collaboration between media producers, STEM professionals and communication researchers in crafting evidence-based media for the public.  The project will also create a 2-year STEM Media Fellows program as well as expand the Science of Communication Strand at two Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festivals (JHWFF) and at the Science Media Awards and Summit in the Hub (SMASH) conference in 2018.  The work will be led by Jackson Hole WILD, a nonprofit professional organization, in partnership with Colorado Mesa University.<br/><br/>The project will employ three strategies to advance effective STEM media production and product effectiveness.  First, an initiative to provide professional development in Communication Science will be part of the 2017 and 2018 Jackson Hole WILD conferences to increase the attending STEM media professionals' understanding of evidence-based practices.  The content will be presented through structured sessions at the conferences with recordings of the sessions made available online as well as through partner organizations.  Second, the STEM Media Fellows program will recruit emerging STEM professionals who are interested in media making.  The goals of the STEM Media Fellows program are to prepare these diverse STEM professionals with knowledge and skills for media development, and form collaborations among the STEM professionals and media creators.  Third, in collaboration with Colorado Mesa University, the project will conduct a Delphi study to determine how mastery of STEM media making is acquired and assessed.  The Delphi study will involve gathering perceptions and experiences from the world's leading STEM communicators and media makers regarding how they learned to be professionals and how they would determine the level of expertise of other STEM media makers.  The results of the Delphi study will synthesize models and identify best practices that could be used to inform the STEM media industry efforts to align media production with evidence-based practices.  These results will be disseminated through appropriate peer-reviewed journals, industry associations, and other outlets of research on informal science education.   This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.  This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

The project will bring together science museum visitor experience developers, visitor studies staff, indoor location technology developers, cyber-learning researchers, and STEM informal learning specialists for a two day conference, COMPASS (Conference on Mobile Position Awareness Systems and Solutions), to address the achievements and potential of indoor location aware mobile (ILAM) technology in science museums. The pre-conference work, the conference itself, and a subsequent e-publication will provide multiple, informed perspectives and knowledge around ILAM for science museums to develop apps for visitors' own smartphones to enhance and personalize the visitor experience and to experiment with new kinds of inquiry-based learning. The goals of the conference are to form an integrated vision by consolidating expertise from disparate disciplines connected to ILAM tech development, to transform visitor mobile tools to provide more innovative forms of interaction and personalization, and to open new avenues for visitor research with automated data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>The COMPASS conference will bring together 80 participants for two days in September 2018 at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, CA. The first dissemination will take place in a presentation at the ASTC conference the following month in October 2018. A webinar sharing insights from COMPASS and inviting others to engage will be held in March 2019 hosted by ASTC and accessible by ASTC members and non-members alike. A companion COMPASS e-publication  will be released for free download, also in March 2019, with summaries of conference proceedings, key issues identified, case histories of ILAM in museums, white papers and other resources. Conference outcomes include establishing a community of practice or special interest group and establishing common goals for future collaborative work. By gathering a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to share research and evidence based findings, COMPASS include collective problem solving and an informed cross disciplinary approach to planning and implementing ILAM technology in the museum environment. The conference will explicitly address the benefits and quality of open source code and protocols and how techniques could be shared among institutions.  As professional experience with deploying ILAM apps grows, this tool could be used to increase accessibility for diverse visitor populations, put in use at smaller and medium sized science centers, and applied to a variety of research studies, increasing the impact for funders and benefiting the science center community at large."

The study is a unique opportunity to learn about how the students go through school from preschool through the end of high school. This opportunity will examine how their readiness for STEM careers and their beliefs about STEM. Their path through school will particularly focus on the connections to mathematics learning and achievement. This project will collect new data to make connections to data collected during the students elementary and middle school years. An important contribution to educational research, policy, and practice will be understanding math knowledge development and readiness for STEM careers over students' entire preK-12 experience. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The project is designed to identify growth trajectories and predictors of more and less successful students. This work continues a study of approximately 500 low-income, predominantly African-American students who have been followed from preschool through 8th grade in a large urban school district. The goals are to (1) examine students' growth in math achievement across high school and related high school growth to previous patterns, (2) identify predictors of math achievement and other indicators of postsecondary readiness, and (3) describe low-income and minority students' beliefs about careers in STEM in high school, including how their beliefs have changed since middle school. The students are predominantly African American (80%) and over 90% eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. In each year of the study, the project team will conduct individual student assessments of math knowledge and collect administrative data on ACT math and science scores as well as course enrollment, grades and end-of-course exam scores, graduation rates, and students' intent to attend college after high school. During the fall of eleventh grade, focus groups with students will ask about their plans after high school and their beliefs about careers in STEM. Similar focus groups were conducted with the students in eighth grade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The available data show that the percentage of African Americans among U.S. engineering bachelor's degree recipients has been declining for more than a decade to 3.5% in 2014. Only 1.1% of the nation's black college freshmen were enrolled in engineering programs in 2010. The project being conducted involves enrolling selected high achieving Baltimore students from schools which don't offer Algebra 1 in 8th grade. The project will offer a 6 week summer preparation program to improve their math skills and expose them to STEM careers. The students will then take a Virtual Algebra 1 class once the semester starts. Since mathematics is a key topic for STEM and lack of math skills is likely to limit some students in pursuing STEM careers, the project helps address an important need. The activities in which students will be involved include field trips and weekly seminars. In addition there is a very detailed timeline and assessment plan to measure the outcomes on all key variables. <br/><br/>Several local school employees/teachers will be directly involved in the project. This is an advantage since it demonstrates that the project clearly has school support. These teachers will be directly developing/enabling Engineers of the Future. The criteria for selecting participants will include the following: There will be a total of 180 randomly selected, high achieving students from Baltimore City Public Schools, a lower-income urban school district with a high proportion of African-American schoolchildren. The involvement of industry professionals will provides role models for the students, giving them a look at the kind of careers they can obtain if they pursue STEM careers. The three-year project will impact 16 middle school teachers and 180 students. The summer learning is combined with virtual learning during the school year. The project will be a combination of blended classroom instruction, hands-on project-based work, and introductions to various STEM careers via field trips and seminars with professionals. Engineers of the Future will offer 3 summer and 3 academic years of support to city schools using a single K-12 adaptive diagnostic test for reading and mathematics that pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level. The project will specifically address gaps in knowledge and contribute to the evidence-based data on successful education programs for promoting STEM education in middle schools, especially those in lower-income, urban school districts with high proportions of African-American schoolchildren. The potential to impact a large number of students by working through Baltimore schools is a major strength of the project. Even though the project focuses on math education, a broad range of STEM careers are involved especially with industry (e.g., with Northrop Grumman). The project examines program artifacts (program materials), semi-structured interviews with program staff, observations of instruction, focus groups with students, questionnaires, surveys and school records which are the kind of data that could be used by other urban school districts. Hence, the essence of the research would provide valuable information and new knowledge of the role virtual learning has when blended with classroom instruction on improving a student's understanding of what is being taught."

The goal is to expand and disseminate strategies to support spatial thinking at the high school level by adapting and implementing the previously developed Geospatial Semester (GSS) one-year, dual-credit course focused on developing geospatial problem-solving skills and applying those skills to student-selected problems. GSS consists of introductory exercises to develop students' basic skills in using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for analyzing spatial problems, supporting students in framing a meaningful problem from a spatial perspective, identifying and organizing relevant spatial datasets, analyzing their spatial data as evidence for proposing solutions for their problem, and making a public presentation of their results. GSS is currently taught in high schools in Virginia in partnership with James Madison University. At the core of GSS is the development of spatial thinking skills, which are strongly predictive of achievement, persistence, and attainment in STEM fields, even after accounting for other relevant variables, such as mathematical and verbal aptitude. Thus, the central purpose of the study is to adapt and implement the GSS high school course in six Career and Technical Education (CTE) clusters in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The project will select participants from identified groups currently underrepresented in STEM occupations. Through the GSS course, students will engage with relevant STEM, social science, and CTE topics that cut across multiple disciplines, and engage in relevant practices, including scientific data collection, analysis, modeling, and interpretation. <br/><br/>The project will adopt and adapt the core elements of the GSS for the context of Chicago CTE programs using a design-based implementation research (DBIR) approach. The study will use a framework of spread and scale to investigate the strategies for expanding and disseminating the course and the ways in which contextual factors influence the likelihood of success. It will address two research questions regarding whether, and how, the GSS can be adapted to the needs of a large, urban district teaching a variety of CTE-related skills: (1) How can large urban school districts develop the necessary infrastructure to implement GSS without the direct support of the developers?; and (2) Can we develop classroom-based assessments of spatial reasoning that have convergent validity with the research-based measures used in past research? To address the former, the project will partner with the City Colleges of Chicago to provide the dual enrollment credit, and engage in co-design with teachers to develop an implementation model that is tailored to CPS's CTE curriculum and supported by continuing professional development practices. To answer the latter, the project will engage in co-design with teachers to develop classroom assessments of spatial thinking and validate the extent to which they correlate with research-based measures. The project will use these assessments to investigate whether the adaptation of GSS in Chicago provides outcomes that are comparable to those of the established GSS implementations in Virginia. Data sources will include classroom observations, ratings of student work products, teacher interviews, student demographics, and growth in student performance on pretest and posttest assessments. A debriefing routine will be used to interpret what has happened and plan prospective events for the next implementation phase. A mixed-method approach will be employed to incorporate quantitative analysis of student learning. As DBIR  research, the project will (a) form partnerships between researchers and practitioners focused on persistent problems of practice from multiple stakeholders' perspectives; (b) focus on the importance of spatial reasoning as foundational for STEM practice through a multi-stakeholder partnership of GIS educators, psychologists, implementation researchers, a large urban district and community college; and (c) develop capacity for sustaining change in systems through GSS teacher leaders and new courses in GIS at City Colleges of Chicago. The project will develop new co-designed curriculum materials through (a) pilot testing of materials (years 1-2); (b) field testing of materials (year 3) with emphasis on professional development, implementation research (to examine the extent to which the program is successfully implemented across a variety of school contexts), and analysis of field-test results; and (c) testing the integration of the professional development and course implementation into the CTE operations, including analysis of the validity and quality of spatial-thinking classroom assessments. The main outcome of this effort will be a high school GIS-focused CTE curriculum prototype developed through co-design processes, as well as DBIR focused on geospatial problem-solving.

Through the GSS course, students will engage with relevant STEM, social science, and CTE topics that cut across multiple disciplines, and engage in relevant practices, including scientific data collection, analysis, modeling, and interpretation. <br/><br/>The project will adopt and adapt the core elements of the GSS for the context of Chicago CTE programs using a design-based implementation research (DBIR) approach. The study will use a framework of spread and scale to investigate the strategies for expanding and disseminating the course and the ways in which contextual factors influence the likelihood of success. It will address two research questions regarding whether, and how, the GSS can be adapted to the needs of a large, urban district teaching a variety of CTE-related skills: (1) How can large urban school districts develop the necessary infrastructure to implement GSS without the direct support of the developers?; and (2) Can we develop classroom-based assessments of spatial reasoning that have convergent validity with the research-based measures used in past research? To address the former, the project will partner with the City Colleges of Chicago to provide the dual enrollment credit, and engage in co-design with teachers to develop an implementation model that is tailored to CPS's CTE curriculum and supported by continuing professional development practices. To answer the latter, the project will engage in co-design with teachers to develop classroom assessments of spatial thinking and validate the extent to which they correlate with research-based measures. The project will use these assessments to investigate whether the adaptation of GSS in Chicago provides outcomes that are comparable to those of the established GSS implementations in Virginia. Data sources will include classroom observations, ratings of student work products, teacher interviews, student demographics, and growth in student performance on pretest and posttest assessments. A debriefing routine will be used to interpret what has happened and plan prospective events for the next implementation phase. A mixed-method approach will be employed to incorporate quantitative analysis of student learning. As DBIR  research, the project will (a) form partnerships between researchers and practitioners focused on persistent problems of practice from multiple stakeholders' perspectives; (b) focus on the importance of spatial reasoning as foundational for STEM practice through a multi-stakeholder partnership of GIS educators, psychologists, implementation researchers, a large urban district and community college; and (c) develop capacity for sustaining change in systems through GSS teacher leaders and new courses in GIS at City Colleges of Chicago. The project will develop new co-designed curriculum materials through (a) pilot testing of materials (years 1-2); (b) field testing of materials (year 3) with emphasis on professional development, implementation research (to examine the extent to which the program is successfully implemented across a variety of school contexts), and analysis of field-test results; and (c) testing the integration of the professional development and course implementation into the CTE operations, including analysis of the validity and quality of spatial-thinking classroom assessments. The main outcome of this effort will be a high school GIS-focused CTE curriculum prototype developed through co-design processes, as well as DBIR focused on geospatial problem-solving. An external advisory board will provide ongoing, independent, and critical reviews of the implementation of the program to evaluate progress, both formative and summative."

Policymakers argue that future STEM workforce needs will only be met if there is broader diversity participating in STEM education and careers. Recent reports have suggested that the nation would benefit from more STEM-focused schools, including at the elementary school level, to inspire interest and prepare students for future STEM endeavors. However, there is currently little information on the number and quality of elementary STEM (eSTEM) schools and the extent to which underrepresented groups have access to them. This project will study five elementary STEM schools from across the U.S. that are inclusive of students from underrepresented groups in order to determine what defines these schools. The project team, which includes investigators from SRI International and George Mason University, initially identified twenty candidate critical components that define inclusive STEM-focused elementary schools and will refine and further clarify the critical components through the research study. The resulting research products could support the development of future eSTEM schools and research on their effectiveness. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This Exploratory Learning Strand project will use an iterative case study replication design to study the design and implementation of five exemplary eSTEM schools with the goal of developing a logic model that highlights the commonalities in core components and target outcomes across the schools, despite the different school contexts. A framework of twenty design components, taken from research on inclusive STEM high schools and research on successful elementary schools, will inform the data collection, analysis, and logic model development. Schools as critical cases will be selected through a nomination process by experts, followed by screening and categorization according to key design components. School documents and public database information, a school survey, and telephone interviews with school administrators will inform screening and selection of candidate schools. Researchers will then conduct multi-day, on-site visitations to each selected school, collecting data from classroom observations, interviews with students, focus groups with teachers and administrators, and discussions with critical members of the school community. The project is also gathering data on school-level student outcome indicators. Using axial and open coding, the analysis aims to develop rich descriptions that showcase characteristics of the schools to iteratively determine a theory of action that illustrates interconnections among context, design, implementation, and outcomes. Research findings will be communicated through a logic model and blueprint, school case study reports, and conference proceedings and publications that will be provided on a project website, providing an immediate and ongoing resource for education leaders, researchers and policymakers to learn about research on these schools and particular models. Findings will also be disseminated by more traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, and webinars."

The project will provide professional development (PD) for high school teachers that includes instruction on CT, SRL, and on using SPIN (Science Practices Innovation Notebook). Next, teachers will collaboratively develop lessons that infuse CT & SRL, upload the lessons into SPIN, implement those lessons in their classrooms, and then collaboratively analyze student work samples captured by SPIN. <br/><br/>Throughout this PD process, researchers will collect multiple forms of data by observation, surveys, SPIN documents and artifacts as part an overall research plan. The research team will employ data analytics to uncover patterns and develop a CT learning progression for grades 9-12. The project proposes implementing four phases of iterative Design Research. In the Informed Exploration phase, researchers and practitioners will work together to find opportunities to teach CT through SRL processes during STEM investigations. The Enactment Phase will involve short iterative tests of design conjectures to develop and build the electronic notebook. The Local Impact phase will engage practitioners in testing the electronic notebook in their classes while researchers document teaching implementation and student learning of CT. In the Broader Impact phase, the electronic notebook will be scaled up to local high school teachers who did not participate in the project implementation.

This project will study why (or why not) young career adults, aged 18-35 engage with the PBS NewsHour science content via broadcast and/or online avenues to advance their STEM knowledge and skills. This age group has shifted away from viewing traditional broadcast news media and increasingly looks to social media channels for science content. Multiple layers of STEM digital content delivered across multiple platforms (including social media) will be used to identify the attributes that engage and motivate these 18-35 year olds. Deliverables include 12 broadcast segments each year with STEM research coverage and a range of transmedia efforts (e.g. additional formats distributed via Instagram, Vine, YouTube, etc.) for testing with the target audience. A complementary component of the project will be an apprenticeship program in which each year five college age students from journalism schools join the professional reporters at the NewsHour to produce STEM content using new and innovative strategies engage to 18-35 year olds. The PBS NewsHour broadcast is currently viewed by 1.4 million adults each night and the website has 2.6 million unique visitors each month. <br/><br/>The research will attempt to define the learning ecologies of 18-35 year olds using psychographic profiles and case studies to illustrate the range of science learners including those in underrepresented groups. The first research component uses a quantitative approach to assess the reaction of the early career adults to the 12 STEM broadcast segments in their original form and after repackaging for social media. A control group audience will watch the original broadcast of each STEM segment and respond to an online questionnaire that will establish how viewers use and/or pass on STEM content and to whom. The test audience will view the content that has been repackaged and presented on a different media platform responding to the same online questionnaire and allowing comparisons of the two groups. The second research component will focus on the college-age journalism apprentices and use participatory action research. The apprentices will collect data about their experiences and reflect on their contributions to STEM reporting. The third research component will be an ethnographic study of the post-production and editorial teams at the PBS NewsHour using focus groups to elicit feedback and evaluate their metacognitive thinking about how to produce stories for early career adults. Data will be collected and analyzed from three groups: early career adults 18-35 years of age; journalism apprentices; and the PBS NewsHour editorial teams. Overall the research will provide new knowledge about producing and distributing digital STEM media that engages and impacts early career adults."

This project will advance knowledge in the design of interest triggers for science in immersive digital simulation learning games. When learners are interested in a topic, it can have a profound impact on the quality of their learning. Although much is known about how informal learning experiences can promote interest in STEM, much less research has addressed links between technology use and interest development. This Exploratory Pathways project will investigate (1) the impact of entertainment technology use by middle school learners on STEM interest development, (2) the design of interactive educational technologies created specifically to trigger interest in astronomy, and (3) informal learning resources for sustained interaction with STEM content over time. In particular, learners will have the opportunity to interactively explore the scientific consequences of considering alternative versions of Earth via ""What if?"" questions, such as ""What if the earth had no moon?"" or ""What if the earth were twice its current size?"". While using the simulations, learners will be invited to make observations and propose scientific explanations for what they see as different. Given recent discoveries of potentially habitable worlds throughout the Galaxy, such questions have high relevance to public discourse around space exploration, conditions necessary for life, and the long-term future of the human race. Studies will occur across three informal learning settings: museum exhibits, afterschool programs, and summer camps, and are driven by the following research questions: What technology-based triggers of interest have the strongest influence on interest? Which contextual factors are most important for supporting long-term interest development? And, what kinds of technology-based triggers are most effective for learners from audiences who are underrepresented in STEM? This research will result in an empirically tested approach for cultivating interest that will allow educators to leverage the ""What if?"" pedagogy in their own work, as well as downloadable materials suitable for use in both informal and formal learning settings. <br/><br/>Planned studies will identify features that are effective in triggering interest, with an emphasis on groups underrepresented in STEM, and elaborate on the importance of engaging learners in explanatory dialogues and in service of interest development. It is hypothesized that interacting in such novel ways can act as a trigger for interest in astronomy, physics, and potentially other areas of STEM. Design iterations will also investigate different forms of learning supports, such as guidance from facilitators, collaboration, and automated guidance available within the simulations, and identify how features vary with respect to learning contexts. Data collected will include interview and survey data to track interest development, measures of knowledge in astronomy and physics, and log files of simulation use to better understand how behaviors in the simulations align with stated interests. Results of the studies will advance the theoretical understanding of interest development and its relationship to interactive experiences, and will also have practical implications for the deployment of technology in informal settings by identifying features critical for triggering the interest of middle school learners. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

The objectives of this project are to increase girls' engineering, technology, and science skills and career interests; build STEM capacity and sustainability across communities; enhance STEM and career exploration for underrepresented girls and their families; and advance research on the scale-up, sustainability, and impact of the model with career exploration. The Techbridge approach is grounded in Eccles' expectancy value model, and helps bridge critical junctures as girls transition from elementary to middle school and middle school to high school, immersing participants in a network of peers and supportive adults. <br/><br/>Techbridge targets girls in grades 5-12 with a model that includes five components:  a previously tested and evaluated curriculum, career exploration, professional development for staff and teachers, family engagement, and dissemination. The inquiry-based curriculum introduces electrical engineering and computer science through engaging, hands-on units on Cars and Engines, Green Design, and Electrical Engineering. The Techbridge model will be enhanced to include a central repository for curriculum and support materials, electronic girl-driven career exploration resources, an online learning community and video tools for staff, and customized family guides. Project deliverables include the dissemination of the enhanced model to three cities, 24 school sites and teachers, 2,000 girls, and over 600 role models. A supplementary research component will study the broad implementation of the Techbridge model by examining the fidelity of implementation and the program's impact on girls' STEM engagement and learning. The research questions are as follows:  <br/><br/>1.  To what extent and how do new program sites demonstrate adherence to the Techbridge program model?<br/>2.  Do new sites experience similar or increased participant responsiveness to Techbridge programming with regard to scientific learning outcomes, career awareness, attitude and interest in engineering? <br/>3.  How are changes experienced by girls sustained over time, if at all?<br/>4.  To what extent and how do new sites balance instilling the Techbridge essentials, those critical components Techbridge identifies as essential for success, with the need for local adaptation and ownership of the program?<br/>5.  Given the potential for customization in local communities, do new sites maintain programmatic quality of delivery experienced at the original site? If so, what are elements essential to success regarding quality delivery?<br/><br/>The mixed-methods study will include document analysis, embedded assessments, participant survey scales, and observations. Qualitative data methods include interviews with teachers, role models, staff and focus groups with girls. A project evaluation will also be conducted which investigates project outcomes for participants (girls, teachers, role models, and families) and fidelity of the implementation and enhancements at expansion sites, using a quasi-experimental approach. Career and learning outcomes for girls will be determined using embedded assessments, portfolios, surveys, school data, and previously validated instruments such as the Career Interest Questionnaire and the Modified Attitudes towards Science Inventory. The Managing Complex Change model is used as a framework for the project evaluation for the purpose of examining factors related to the effectiveness of scaling. The dissemination of research and evaluation findings will be achieved through the use of publications, blogs, social media, and conferences.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that this project will broaden the participation of Hispanic, African-American, and English language learner girls, build capacity for STEM programming and sustainability at the dissemination sites, and disseminate findings to over 1 million educators, researchers, and community members. Broader impacts include contributing to the field's understanding of how virtual role models and field trips can engage young women, increase corporate advocacy, and engage participants in research and dissemination efforts."

The current ways of providing communication and information access to DHH museum visitors require DHH learners to split their attention between the visual focus of the experience and the interpreter or captioning display. As a result, DHH learners are forced to decide which information to miss during live presentations, thus presentations may not be fully comprehended by the DHH learner. Furthermore, this issue perpetuates a lack of inclusivity and accessibility in informal STEM learning environments. The work focuses on investigating approaches to develop an AR platform with a near-eye display that will allow DHH visitors to receive signed or captioned instruction while still looking at and interacting with the intended exhibits. The new platform will allow for transmission of live and spontaneous instruction. Researchers will evaluate and recommend efficient ways to make information at science centers and museums accessible to the DHH population based on data collected from DHH learners. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program's Pilot and Feasibility Studies which seek new approaches to design and development of STEM learning to be accessible to all learners including underrepresented groups in informal environments.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the following research question: how can the use of Augmented Reality (AR) as a method of support service delivery improve the engagement of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) adolescent learners in semi-structured learning environments?

Computer based simulations in science can provide valuable opportunities for these students to experience and manipulate natural phenomena related to critical STEM ideas.  However, existing simulations remain largely inaccessible to students with visual impairments in particular.  Recent advances in technology related to sonification use with simulations can make it possible for these students to have a more complete and authentic experience. Sonification is the use of non-speech sounds, such as musical tones, to represent visual information including data.  Such sounds can be manipulated temporally and spatially and can also vary by amplitude and frequency to convey information that is more traditionally displayed visually.  <br/><br/>Researchers will iteratively develop five middle school physical science simulations to include sonifications aimed at enhancing accessibility for all learners, but particularly for those with visual impairments.

With each providing different affordances for learning, it is often feasible to combine the two in a multitude of ways. This project will conduct a series of studies to: (1) Uncover the differential benefits of physical versus virtual labs, for learners with a range of abilities and prior knowledge, and for content of different difficulty levels; (2)  Understand the differential effects of sequencing physical and virtual labs for different learners and content; and (3) Examine how best to combine physical and virtual labs in mixed reality environments. In addressing an important question in educational research, the project will help clarify the currently conflicting findings about the learning benefits of physical and virtual experimentation in fostering deep learning of science concepts. Publications resulting from the project will significantly extend current knowledge about learning from hands-on experimentation and learning from simulated experiments.<br/><br/>The research team will systematically examine factors that affect learning from physical and virtual labs in studies conducted across three grade levels in three states.  Rigorous analytical tools will assess the effect of several factors on students' learning processes and outcomes. Each year's studies will build upon results from the prior years. The first set of studies will address the comparison of virtual and physical experimentation. A second and third set of studies will investigate the sequencing of physical and virtual experimentation under different conditions. The fourth set of studies will explore an integration of the physical and the virtual for different learners and materials. In each study, a range of data will be collected to understand how students learn, their learning outcomes, and the strategies that teachers use to facilitate learning from physical and virtual labs.  Outcomes will include (1) comparisons of students' learning in physical, virtual, sequenced physical and virtual, and integrated physical and virtual labs; 2) knowledge about conditions that promote or hinder learning from physical and virtual labs individually and in various combinations; (3) an understanding of how learning is affected in physical, virtual, sequenced, and integrated labs by differing contexts, topics, student prior knowledge and ability; and (4) a clear and detailed qualitative picture of the differences and similarities in teacher strategies and student learning dynamics in physical, virtual, sequenced, and integrated labs."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Engineering is an important component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  However, resources for supporting teachers in implementing these standards are scarce.  This project will address the need for resources by applying an innovative pedagogy called Imaginative Education (IE) to create middle school engineering curricula.  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives are used to design learning environments that help learners engage with content and organize their knowledge productively.  To fully exploit the potential of this pedagogy, this project will combine IE with transmedia storytelling.  In transmedia storytelling, different elements of a narrative are spread across a variety of formats (such as books, websites, new articles, videos and other media) in a way that creates a coordinated experience for the user.  Once created, the curricula will be implemented in classrooms to research its impact on (1) increasing learners' capacities to engage in both innovative and direct application of engineering concepts, and (2) improving learners'  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity.  <br/><br/>This research will be led by Smith College and Springfield Technical Community College in collaboration with Springfield (MA) Public Schools (SPS).  Additional expertise in evaluating the findings will be provided by the Collaborative for Educational Services and an external advisory board of leaders in STEM education and transmedia storytelling.  The project will result in the development of a transmedia learning environment that includes two NGSS-aligned, interdisciplinary engineering units and seven lessons that integrate science and engineering.  The research study will be implemented in four phases in eight SPS middle schools.  Approximately 900 students will participate each year.  In Phase 1, the project team will collaborate with SPS teachers to create engineering units, lessons, and standards-based achievement measures.  In Phase 2, teachers in the treatment group will participate in professional development (PD) workshops covering IE, transmedia learning environments, structure of the curriculum, and connections to NGSS.  In Phase 3 the curricula will be implemented in treatment classrooms and both treatment and control group students will be assessed.  In Phase 4, testing and assessment will continue in SPS schools and will be expanded to rural and suburban classrooms.  Teachers in these classrooms will use online multimedia PD that will ensure scalability and mirrors the structure and content of in-person PD.  Data analysis will provide evidence of whether this imaginative and transmedia educational approach improves students' capacities for using engineering concepts and enhances their STEM identity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the participation of women and underrepresented groups in post-secondary computer science programs remains discouragingly and persistently low. One of the most important findings from research in computer science education is the degree to which informal experiences with computers (at many ages and in many settings) shape young people's trajectories through high school and into undergraduate degree programs. Just as early language and mathematics literacy begins at home and is reinforced throughout childhood through a variety of experiences both in school and out, for reasons of diversity and competency, formal experiences with computational literacy alone are insufficient for developing the next generation of scientists, engineers, and citizens. Thus, this CAREER program of research seeks to contribute to a conceptual and design framework to rethink computational literacy in informal environments in an effort to engage a broad and diverse audience. It builds on the concept of cultural forms to understand existing computational literacy practices across a variety of learning settings and to contribute innovative technology designs.<br/> <br/>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in these settings. This CAREER program of research seeks to understand the role of cultural forms in informal computational learning experiences and to develop a theoretically grounded approach for designing such experiences for youth. This work starts from the premise that new forms of computational literacy will be born from existing cultural forms of literacy and numeracy (i.e., for mathematical literacy there are forms like counting songs -- ""10 little ducks went out to play""). Many of these forms play out in homes between parents and children, in schools between teachers and students, and in all sorts of other place between friends and siblings.<br/> <br/>This program of study is a three-phased design and development effort focused on key research questions that include understanding (1) how cultural forms can help shape audience experiences in informal learning environments; (2) how different cultural forms interact with youth's identity-related needs and motivations; and (3) how new types of computational literacy experiences based on these forms can be created. Each phase includes inductive research that attempts to understand computational literacy as it exists in the world and a design phase guided by concrete learning objectives that address specific aspects of computational literacy. Data collection strategies will include naturalist observation, semi-structured, and in-depth interviews, and learning assessments; outcome measures will center on voluntary engagement, motivation, and persistence around the learning experiences. The contexts for research and design will be museums, homes, and afterschool programs.<br/> <br/>This research builds on a decade of experience by the PI in designing and studying computational literacy experiences across a range of learning settings including museums, homes, out-of-school programs, and classrooms.  Engaging a broad and diverse audience in the future of STEM computing fields is an urgent priority of the US education system, both in schools and beyond. This project would complement substantial existing efforts to promote in-school computational literacy and, if successful, help bring about a more representative, computationally empowered citizenry. The integrated education plan supports the training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging research methods at the intersection of the learning sciences, computer science, and human-computer interaction. This work will also develop publically available learning experiences potentially impacting thousands of youth. These experiences will be available in museums, on the Web, and through App stores."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The goal of this project is to make 21st century quantum science comprehensible and engaging to non-expert informal adult learners. This project has strong potential to add new knowledge about the public's perception and understanding of quantum physics. This scientific content is often difficult for informal audiences to grasp, and there are relatively few accessible learning resources for a non- professional audience. The development of this online, interactive resource with short animations, graphics, and simulations has strong potential to fill this gap. It will develop a visually driven online resource to engage non-expert audiences in understanding the basics of quantum physics.  The web design will be modular, incorporating many multimedia elements and the structure will be flexible allowing for future expansion.  All content would be freely available for educational use. There is potential for extensive reach and use of the resources by informal adult learners online as well as learners in museums, science centers, and schools. Project partners are the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, College Park.<br/><br/>An independent evaluation of the project will add new knowledge about informal learners' perceptions and/or knowledge about quantum science and technology.  An initial needs assessment via focus groups with the general public will be designed to find out more about what they already know about quantum physics topics and terminology, as well as what they want to know and what formats they prefer (games, simulations, podcasts, etc.).  In person user testing will be used with early versions of the project online resource using a structured think-aloud protocol.  Later in year 1 and 2, online focus groups with the general public will be conducted to learn what they find engaging and what they learned from the content.  Iterative feedback from participants during the formative stage will guide the development of the content and format of the online resources.  The Summative Evaluation will gather data using a retrospective post-survey embedded with a pop-up link on the Atlas followed by interviews with a subset of online users.  Google Analytics will be used to determine the breadth and depth of their online navigation, what resources they download, and what websites they visit afterward.   A post-only survey of undergraduate and graduate students who participated in resource development will focus on changes in students' confidence around their science communication skills and level of quantum physics understanding."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Engineering is an important component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  However, resources for supporting teachers in implementing these standards are scarce.  This project will address the need for resources by applying an innovative pedagogy called Imaginative Education (IE) to create middle school engineering curricula.  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives are used to design learning environments that help learners engage with content and organize their knowledge productively.  To fully exploit the potential of this pedagogy, this project will combine IE with transmedia storytelling.  In transmedia storytelling, different elements of a narrative are spread across a variety of formats (such as books, websites, new articles, videos and other media) in a way that creates a coordinated experience for the user.  Once created, the curricula will be implemented in classrooms to research its impact on (1) increasing learners' capacities to engage in both innovative and direct application of engineering concepts, and (2) improving learners'  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity.  <br/><br/>This research will be led by Smith College and Springfield Technical Community College in collaboration with Springfield (MA) Public Schools (SPS).  Additional expertise in evaluating the findings will be provided by the Collaborative for Educational Services and an external advisory board of leaders in STEM education and transmedia storytelling.  The project will result in the development of a transmedia learning environment that includes two NGSS-aligned, interdisciplinary engineering units and seven lessons that integrate science and engineering.  The research study will be implemented in four phases in eight SPS middle schools.  Approximately 900 students will participate each year.  In Phase 1, the project team will collaborate with SPS teachers to create engineering units, lessons, and standards-based achievement measures.  In Phase 2, teachers in the treatment group will participate in professional development (PD) workshops covering IE, transmedia learning environments, structure of the curriculum, and connections to NGSS.  In Phase 3 the curricula will be implemented in treatment classrooms and both treatment and control group students will be assessed.  In Phase 4, testing and assessment will continue in SPS schools and will be expanded to rural and suburban classrooms.  Teachers in these classrooms will use online multimedia PD that will ensure scalability and mirrors the structure and content of in-person PD.  Data analysis will provide evidence of whether this imaginative and transmedia educational approach improves students' capacities for using engineering concepts and enhances their STEM identity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet we still know little about the role of questioning in STEM learning. This project investigates how and why certain types of questions may be better at fostering learning. In particular, in contrast to questions asked by a person seeking to learn something new (information-seeking questions), children may learn better from questions asked by someone who clearly knows the answer and intends to teach (pedagogical questions). This project bridges what we know about the development of children's thinking with research on how specific types of questions work to support young children's learning of science. To learn more about this, it examines the role of two types of questions across a range of scientific methods including experiments in laboratory settings, observation of children's conversations with parents and teachers in museums and classrooms, and interventions to test how types of questions work in the everyday activity of storybook reading. In addition to their importance for families, project findings will be valuable to preschool and elementary teachers and to educators who work in informal science settings such as science museums, zoos, and play centers. The project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/> <br/>The project builds upon a long tradition of educational and developmental research on children's learning from questions in formal and informal STEM learning environments. Taking a new perspective, the project takes into account the relations among questions, the questioner, and learning goals. Specifically, it proposes that questions from knowledgeable others who intend to teach (i.e., pedagogical questions) may facilitate learning by eliciting children's inferences about the importance of the scientific subject being questioned, and by encouraging their further exploration and discovery learning. These assumptions will be tested across five empirical studies, each with its own specific aim. Aim 1 is to identify pedagogical questions and their effects on children's learning and exploration of scientific information in a controlled laboratory environment. Aim 2 seeks to characterize the use of pedagogical questions in math, physics, and biology classrooms using archival videos and transcripts from the ClassBank database, and explores the relation of pedagogical questions to student engagement. Aim 3 is to characterize the use of pedagogical questions in naturalistic parent-child conversations documented in the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) database, and explore the influence of socio-cultural factors on parents' tendencies to ask different types of questions. These factors include family socioeconomic status, presence of mothers and fathers, children's age, historical trend, and others. Aim 4 tests how natural variation in parents' use of pedagogical questions relates to children's learning and exploration in a science museum. Aim 5 tests an intervention that prompts parents to ask pedagogical questions during storybook sharing and examines how this intervention relates to children's learning of scientific knowledge. Across these five studies pedagogical questions are expected to have a facilitative role for children's learning and exploration, while socio-cultural factors are expected to influence how pedagogical questions are asked by parents and interpreted by children. Taken as a whole, this project has potential to deliver empirical evidence and a more comprehensive theory about when and why questions lead to learning. This research is important to society because it can lead to evidence-based recommendations about how to effectively use questions to enhance STEM teaching and children's learning."

The project responds to a broad concern in educational research and practice: Experiences of failure are frequently so negative that students shut down, lose agency, and develop low self-efficacy and learned helplessness. Surrendering too quickly to obstacles is particularly unfortunate, given evidence that initially ""getting it wrong"" ultimately breeds deep and sustained learning. In order to learn how students can make the most of productive failure, the proposed project will study how a community of practice that includes middle school youth and their mentors attempts to change its handling of learning obstacles. Building on prior research documenting storytelling practices in an afterschool program, the team now aims to embolden young students' productive practices of failure storytelling in computer science, a field in which experts practice candid, pervasive, and collaborative discourse around errors (""bugs""). <br/><br/>Pulling together the domains of narrative analysis, meta-cognitive reflection, and control theories of motivation, within the context of authentic computer-science debugging activity, this study develops a theoretical framework that views productive responses to failure as a discipline-specific process of reflecting as a community on how to locate obstacles, how to construct causal theories about why those obstacles emerged, and how to plan productive responses. A design-based research approach will investigate three questions: (1) What is the impact of the interventions on students and instructors' actions and discourse when they are debugging errors in computer code? (2) What is the impact of the interventions on students and instructors' reflections back on their prior debugging experiences and on failure in general? and (3) What is the impact of the instructor-development efforts on the instructors' capacity to foster students' productive attitudes toward failure? The study focus will be 15 summer and weekend coding workshops with 5th-8th grade students from populations typically under-represented in STEM. The interventions are (a) setting new norms and practices for debugging, (b) instructor education, and (c) coding software that provides students with feedback on their productive struggle. Data sources include video and audio recordings of the learning environment, artifacts produced during the activities, and semi-structured interviews. Measures will capture variations in debugging activities, reflections on debugging, students' ideas about grit and growth mindset, and instructors' struggles and successes with the new curriculum.

Students will be introduced to basic applied physics concepts in rigid-body dynamics where they will design, test, and redesign model stock mini-cars using computer assisted design software, 3D printers, and virtual and desk-top wind tunnels. To prepare students for this challenge, university-led summer institutes will provide all eighth grade science teachers with the knowledge, technical content, and technology experience needed to implement the integrated curriculum based on engineering practices. This step provides assurance that teachers can move students from the fundamental to the challenge level where students will seek a deeper understanding of engineering design principles. <br/><br/>Graduate and senior-level aerospace systems engineering students and faculty members from the University of Akron and other local partners will help guide teachers and students through six basic tasks using model mini-cars.

Researchers seek to understand how those influence affect the development of numerical concepts in human children at the cognitive and neural levels. This research program at the University of Rochester tests the hypothesis that children's early numerical concepts originate from a primitive cognitive and neural system for spatial reasoning.<br/><br/>The proposed research takes an interdisciplinary approach by combining animal cognition, cognitive development, neuroimaging, and mathematics education measures into an integrative analysis of the origins and basic structure of numerical concepts in human children. This interdisciplinary approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test a single hypothesis in a systematic fashion, using a consistent set of methods and across different levels of analysis. The experiments test: 1) the degree to which numerical and spatial perception overlap in the developing brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 4- to 6-year-old children; 2) the degree to which numerical and spatial perception become distinct as children receive cultural input from counting education; and 3) the degree to which human children exhibit similar levels of perceptual integration to non-human animals in their representation of numerical and spatial properties. These experiments speak to whether spatial perception gives rise to mathematical cognition in the developing human brain and so reveals the evolutionary and cultural influences on the developmental trajectory of human numerical concepts.<br/><br/>The research program contributes widely to cognitive science, neuroscience, and mathematics education. The cognitive and neuroimaging data from human children advance our knowledge of the developing human brain and provide critical input for early childhood education practices and assumptions about individual differences and gender differences. The comparative data from human children and non-human animals allow researchers to identify fundamental principles that give rise to human mathematical concepts and intrinsic perceptual biases that young children bring to numerical concept learning as they enter school. Together, these data are critical for understanding how humans successfully develop mathematical concepts."

Nationally, there is a need for programs that support students' learning of algebra and that provide research-based resources and models particularly for students in need of additional support. The design of the Transition to Algebra curriculum reflects the idea that students underprepared for Algebra 1 can benefit from very specific help in building the logic of algebra by connecting arithmetic pattern and algebraic structure. The materials feature the use of mental mathematics, puzzles, explorations, and student dialogues to connect arithmetic pattern to algebraic structure.  These features should encourage students to expect mathematics ideas to make sense, and to build algebraic habits of mind and problem solving stamina. The research will investigate the effects of the curriculum on students' algebra achievement and their attitudes towards mathematics. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

To address this challenge, Twin Cities PBS (TPT) is implementing SciGirls CONNECT2. This three-year Research in Service to Practice award examines how gender equitable and culturally responsive teaching strategies influence middle school girls' confidence, interest and motivation around STEM studies, and their choices around STEM careers. A set of research-based strategies, called the SciGirls Seven, are currently employed in SciGirls, an NSF-funded informal STEM educational outreach program serving 125+ educational partner organizations nationwide. The goal is to update and enrich the SciGirls Seven, providing educators with a critical, current, and more effective resource to motivate girls in STEM studies and careers. It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>Florida State University will conduct a formal research study investigating the hypothesis that STEM programs that use gender equitable and culturally responsive strategies contribute to girls' positive STEM identity development, including their sense of self-efficacy, persistence and aspirations around future STEM careers. This research will include a literature review and a study of girls' STEM identity creation. The mixed methods study will include quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis measuring changes in students' STEM identity and teachers' confidence in STEM teaching. The quantitative data will come from the student, parent and teacher pre/post surveys. The qualitative research will be conducted via case studies at four sites and the qualitative data will include observations, focus groups and interviews. Girls at all partner sites will create videos that will allow the research team to gather additional insight. The independent firm Knight Williams, Inc. will conduct the project's external evaluation.<br/><br/>The project will work with a subset of 16 current SciGirls partners. These geographically diverse partners will reach youth in all-girls and co-ed informal STEM education programs in a variety of settings. More than half serve Hispanic or other minority populations. The updated strategies will be disseminated to the 2,500 educators within the SciGirls partner network and the 18,800 STEM education organizations of the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) network. Dissemination of the strategies and literature review will focus on the informal STEM education field through publications and presentations, posts at PBS LearningMedia, a free online space reaching 1.5 million teachers and educators."

Elementary and middle school experiences are thus vitally important in attracting students to STEM. Research consistently points to after-school as a golden opportunity to increase students' exposure to high-quality math learning opportunities and to develop the key influencers of math participation and persistence: interest and identity. However, more research on how and under what conditions after-school programs can foster these factors is needed. The role of identity in math education has been particularly neglected. The proposed research project addresses this gap by studying the implementation and outcomes of After-School Math PLUS (ASM+), an after-school math program designed to address all aspects of math identity and thus have a positive effect on this key influencer of math participation and achievement. ""Improving Math Identity"" is a Research-in-Service to Practice project funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>The team will study the impact of ASM+ through a rigorous randomized controlled trial of 30 elementary-level after-school sites in South Carolina serving predominately low-income and minority students (15 treatment using ASM+; 15 control using Mixing in Math). Sites selected into the study must serve fourth and fifth graders and must operate five days a week. Through an implementation study, data will be collected in order to assess the program and understand the experiences of group leaders and students in the ASM+ program and at comparison sites.  Data sources include surveys, interviews, observations, and administrative data collected from the treatment and control sites.  The study will investigate how and to what extent ASM+ develops fourth and fifth grade students' math identity and increases math engagement and interest.  It will explore whether increasing identity, engagement, and interest leads to greater skill development and academic achievement. <br/><br/>This research is being conducted by IMPAQ International LLC, a social science and public policy research and evaluation firm in collaboration with Educational Equity at FHI 360, a global development and education organization. The research addresses the need to enhance students' math identity at an early age and, as a result, change students' educational and career aspirations. The ultimate goal is to broaden participation in STEM by underrepresented groups. Results will inform the development of interventions designed to motivate and retain students in STEM, particularly in informal settings. Knowledge gained from this research will be broadly disseminated to practitioners, researchers, program developers, and policy makers."

Fortunately, spatial skills are malleable, and improvements in them are durable and generalizable. Increasing spatial skills during educational training may be one route towards increasing the STEM workforce. However, there are two gaps in current knowledge. First, existing research concentrates almost exclusively on small-scale spatial skills such as mentally rotating objects. The relation between large-scale spatial skills such as navigation and STEM has not been investigated. Scientific disciplines, especially the ""geo"" disciplines, and any disciplines using map-like distributions, may benefit from training in large-scale spatial skills. This project tests this hypothesis. Second, there is a need for a long-term spatial training plan that can be integrated into K-12 and university classrooms. One such strategy may be teaching Geographic Information Systems (GIS) skills. For example, GIS skills facilitate faster access to data, data modeling, and data visualization. GIS tools are used by professionals in many STEM fields including healthcare, geography and urban planning, environmental studies, and finance. Effective use of GIS depends on understanding the technology, its benefits and shortcomings, and its relation to specific spatial skills. This project will evaluate the efficacy of GIS training and identify its active components. Findings can be used to inform GIS instruction and GIS interface customization. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/><br/>This project evaluates the importance of large-scale spatial skills in the geography, geoscience, and other scientific disciplines that reply on spatial distributions of information (e.g., epidemiology). Spatial skills relevant to navigation may be predictors of success in these disciplines, and conversely, participation in these disciplines may benefit large-scale spatial skills. This project concentrates on GIS as a predictor of enrollment and success in fundamental and advanced GIS courses at Temple University and University of Wyoming. Simultaneously, it examines GIS technologies as a potential intervention to improve large-scale spatial skills and to create what has been called 'as a spatial turn of mind.'The effective use of GIS depends on our understanding of human spatial representations and its limits. Students enrolled in fundamental and advanced GIS courses will be compared to students enrolled in non-GIS low-spatial courses. Groups are compared in terms of their navigation proficiency and associated cognitive mechanisms (e.g., perspective-taking) at baseline and in terms of their growth over the semester. A virtual environment navigation paradigm will be used to objectively assess large-scale navigation skills. Successful learning in GIS courses will be assessed in multiple ways including hands-on GIS lab exercises, quizzes, exams and individual/group projects. GIS presents an opportunity to integrate spatial training early in formal education and thus increase low- and high- spatial students' interest in spatial concepts through creative and hands-on activities. Findings can inform spatial interventions designed to motivate more students to pursue careers in STEM fields involving spatial distributions. Findings can also be used to direct attention to spatial skill-dependent usability features in geovisualization tools and the importance of customization to learners' level of competence."

Currently, however, no research-based models are available to guide the development, characterization, and assessment of young children's algebraic thinking, particularly at the start of formal schooling. This study will design a curricular framework for developing children's algebraic thinking across Grades K-2, with a particular focus on understanding how to support the teaching and learning of algebra with students in at-risk settings. Study outcomes will include a prototype Grades K-2 instructional sequence, related assessments, and characterizations of progressions in students' thinking as they advance through the instructional sequence. The impact of this work would be to provide a critical roadmap for teaching and learning algebra in Grades K-2 that can clarify and deepen the role of algebra in the elementary grades, strengthen current college and career readiness standards and practices, and provide curricular support for elementary teachers in systematically developing children's algebraic thinking.<br/><br/>The study will use design research to develop and empirically test a K-2 Early Algebra Learning Progression prototype for diverse learners. The context for this study is a North Carolina elementary school, which consists of a student population that is 64% non-white, with 63% categorized as low SES and 27% as English Language Learners. The sample consists of approximately 60 Grades K-2 students. To empirically test the prototype's framework, learning goals, and instructional sequence, classroom teaching experiments (CTEs) will be conducted in conjunction with individual student interviews. These interviews will be conducted at three time points (pre, mid, and post) during the CTEs. Qualitative methods of analysis will be used to identify themes regarding children's understanding of core algebraic thinking practices and concepts in CTE and interview data. Quantitative methods will also be used to identify patterns of growth in students' algebraic thinking from interview data. Results will be used to refine the framework, goals, and sequence, as well as to identify levels of sophistication in children's thinking as they advance through the sequence. Interview assessments conducted during the CTEs will be analyzed for psychometric soundness to ensure they are valid and reliable. In particular, inter-rater reliability measures will be used to ensure that coding of interview data is consistent, internal consistency estimates of reliability will be calculated and used to remove or modify items, and stability of the assessment items will be examined through within-subject correlations of common items and used to remove or modify items. For validity, observed item difficulty will be correlated with predicted item difficulty by the project's expert advisory board to identify items that need modification or deletion.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

It is an innovative approach to network analysis that brings simultaneous multi-user predictive network data entry and live visualization into university history classrooms to support pedagogy and learning. The network tool is called Net.Create and it will provide an easy-to use interface and curricular materials that are designed from the ground up to be successfully implemented in a lecture classroom. Net.Create supports the collaborative generation of data as a method of interpreting evidence from multiple historical texts and then using network analysis to understand the complexity of historical interactions. Net.Create will also give practical guidance for how instructors in a variety of disciplines with similar complex interactions can adapt network visualization and analysis skills, typically the focus of STEM disciplines, to support students as they engage with humanities and social science learning.<br/><br/>Network analysis is an increasingly popular and powerful computational tool for the analysis of large data sets. Digital historians have used these tools to represent and analyze historical contexts because they support scholars in looking at a broad range of connections between people, places, and events. While humanities pedagogues are optimistic that these capabilities also provide unique opportunities for supporting students in learning history, available tools do not support easy integration into humanities classrooms, and there is not yet empirical or theoretical support for how this might be accomplished effectively. As part of this integration, Net.Create aims to support novice history learners in recognizing how historical practices are grounded in argumentation rather than in single authoritative accounts by scaffolding students in creating and refining visualizations of historical corpora, allowing them to see these rich contexts, and then challenging them to develop and defend historical argument using these visualizations. Analysis will explore how the Net.Create tool and curricular activities contribute to students' historical practices and to student understanding of network analysis approaches, and whether these network-analysis practices result in new historical learning, retention, and understanding. The design of Net.Create is intended to support students in a wide range of contexts in engaging in challenging historical practices, and in appreciating how these practices are grounded in constructing arguments using evidence from the past. These approaches generalize beyond the 200 students of this initial pilot to students across the country via freely available tools, and across disciplines through an easy customization process. Net.Create and the associated curriculum also provide a unique opportunity to teach students to use humanities classrooms to learn cutting-edge digital approaches to scholarship which can apply across disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of notable significance is the deep convergence of Hawaiian culture and STEM learning with real world industry-aligned problem solving and workforce development opportunities across three Hawaiian Islands. Few, if any, ITEST projects have examined the profound potential impact such convergence could have on these specific target populations. Thus, the proposed work will add to the literature while also directly impacting hundreds of secondary students and teachers, postsecondary students, and others.

The project will investigate how literacy-based instructional strategies, as well as contextual factors, mediate the development of engineering design thinking of low-income Latino middle school students, including English learners, as they attend technology and engineering courses. Engineering design thinking will focus on fundamental aspects of this discipline, such as identifying a problem; considering possible solutions; formulating a plan for the solution; developing, implementing, and testing the plan; evaluating results, redesigning the plan, and testing it again. Literacy-based instructional strategies will include comprehension (summarizing, predicting, inferring, and questioning written text); vocabulary (constructing explicit definitions by making connections to their students' background knowledge); writing-to-learn heuristic (identifying a need, defining a problem, generating solutions, testing, observing results, making claims based on empirical evidence, optimizing, and reflecting on how ideas change); and argumentation (thinking and articulating the relationships between claims and evidence). Technology and Engineering courses are based on the application of existing technology within the field of engineering through the use of basic engineering principles and technical skills, while simultaneously addressing national literacy, science, and engineering standards. These courses are designed to acquaint students with the states' labor markets and the employment opportunities for which they can prepare.<br/><br/>The study will focus on three research questions: (1) How do literacy-based instructional strategies mediate the development of engineering design thinking?; (2) How do features of technology and engineering classroom settings seem to support students' literacy and engineering design?; and (3) How do contextual factors appear to afford or constrain middle school technology and engineering teachers' use of literacy-based instructional strategies? Employing a staggered design-based research and its iterative cycle of design, implementation, and retrospective analysis; the project will work with (a) 10 urban and rural middle schools, (b) 10 teachers who teach mandatory technology and engineering courses, (c) 22 classrooms, and (d) 660 students over the course of 7 trimesters, as they integrate engineering design and literacy. Each classroom will be organized in small groups (pairs of students) representative of English language proficiencies (e.g., English learners at different proficiency levels; non-English learners) to promote cooperative learning, facilitate the implementation of the literacy strategies, and trace evidence of conceptual change in the context of engineering thinking. Data gathering strategies will include classroom observations, video- and audio-taped of pairs working, pre- and post-surveys, and interviews with students and teachers. Data interpretation strategies will include retrospective analysis, microgenetic learning analysis, within-case analysis, cross-case analysis, and constant comparative analysis to identify the features of the technology and engineering classroom settings that support students' engagement with literacy. Case studies will result in contextualized profiles of student learning in particular learning environments, suitable for identifying the consequences attributable to the treatments and describing the mechanisms and conditions under which these relationships occur within the target population. The key outcome of the proposed study will be a literacy-infused engineering design, research-based and field-tested model of instruction for middle school Latino students, potentially adaptable in other similar settings. A four-member advisory board with expertise in engineering, engineering design, and literacy instruction will oversee the work annually and assess completed tasks. An external researcher will be responsible for the formative and summative evaluation of the project."

The primary goal of this project is to create a sustainable ecosystem of young programmers (primarily middle school students), mentors, and teachers in the city of Newark, NJ. To achieve such an ecosystem, the project will: 1) Provide computing education to underrepresented and underserved middle school students; 2) Involve parents in and educate them about the importance of computational thinking and computing for their children's education, career, and future life; 3) Develop and maintain mentor-mentee relationships in coding; 4) Teach practicing (and potential future) teachers introductory programming concepts and how to pass them on; and 5) Fully involve teachers in the research problem-solving cycle. To accomplish these tasks, the project will run 10-week Saturday programs for middle school students each semester at participating middle school campuses. Before the start of the program, the project will have a parents' night at a local middle school to educate parents about the program, computing, and why their children should participate in the program. Each Saturday will consist of a 7-hour day, split into a morning session (building a website with HTML and CSS) and an afternoon session (learning text and block programming languages). Every other week, a guest speaker from the community will give a brief presentation of her/his career and how it was advanced by computing. Each class will have a minimum of one teacher from the middle school and a minimum of two university students who will co-teach the class and learn from each other. Once the students have finished their 10-week program, the project will invite them to join the Coding House of the Urban League of Essex County, a designated space in central Newark for local K-8 and university students to continue with their coding activities. Here, the students can learn from each other, work on projects, and develop mentor/mentee relationships. This research and development project has the potential to inform other communities about integrating computing education into their schools, involving parents, providing opportunities for practicing teachers to learn about computing topics, and giving university students practical teaching experience (who may also become interested in becoming alternate path K-8 teachers themselves). This project is supported by the Information Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers and Computer Science for All programs. <br/><br/>This research will contribute new insights into parental motivation/education, how to effectively train practicing teachers in computational thinking, how to facilitate the entry of university student co-teachers into the teaching profession (if they wish), and how to create an ecosystem to keep students engaged with programming through a community coding space. The project will address the following research questions: What are the specific needs of our community's parents (or guardians), and how can the project assist them to help their children succeed? How can the project train practicing (and potential future) teachers in a non-invasive, safe environment? How can middle school teachers formulate pedagogical content knowledge targeted towards computing in the context of an equitable Research-Practice Partnership with the project team? How can the project provide and prepare accessible, relatable, and effective near-peer mentors and role-models who are knowledgably in computing to NJ middle school students? Data will primarily consist of: responses from questionnaires; written notes from Parents' Night events, teacher interviews, and teacher observations; attendance records from Newark Kids Code's participating middle schools; visitor logs from the Urban League (Parents' Night events and Coding House participation); server logs from Gidget website and online repositories of Newark Kids Code Student Scratch and code.org projects. The project will use pre-post analysis and coding of qualitative data to describe the impacts of the interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses this aim by using systems thinking and interdisciplinary integration approaches to develop a novel immersive educational simulation game and associated materials designed to highlight the role and importance of corn-water-ethanol-beef (CWEB) systems in supporting the ever increasing demands for food, energy, and water in the United States. The focus on FEWS and sustainable energy aligns well with both the INFEWS program and the sizable sustainability-related projects in the AISL program portfolio. The development and broad dissemination of a multiuser game specific to CWEB systems are particularly innovative contributions and advance for both program portfolios and their requisite fields of study. An additional unique feature of the game is the embedding of varying degrees of economic principles and decision-making along with the nuisances of cultural context as salient variables that influence systems thinking. Of note, a team of computer science, management and engineering undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln will be responsible for the engineering, development, and deployment of the game as their university capstone projects. If successful, this game will have a significant reach and impact on youth in informal programs (i.e., 4-H clubs), high school teachers and students in agriculture vocational education courses, college students, and the public. The impact could extend well beyond Nebraska and the targeted Midwestern region. <br/><br/>In conjunction with the game development, mixed-methods formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by an external evaluator. The formative evaluation of the game will focus on usability testing, interest and engagement with a select sample of youth at local 4-H clubs and youth day camps. Data will be collected from embedded in-game survey questionnaires, rating scales, observations and focus groups conducted with evaluation sample. These data and feedback will be used to inform the design and refinement of the game. The summative evaluation will focus on the overall impacts of the game. Changes in agricultural systems knowledge, attitudes toward agricultural systems, interest in pursuing careers in agricultural systems, and decision making will be aligned with the Nebraska State Science Standards and tracked using the National Agricultural Literacy Outcomes (NALOs) assessment, game analytics and pre/post-test measures administered to the evaluation study sample pre/post exposure to the game."

This project aims to improve our understanding of important instructional principles emanating from cognitive science that are related to success in community college mathematics.  The studies in this project aim both to advance our understanding of learning and to apply learning innovations to known challenges in authentic learning settings, thus testing and extending the generalizability of laboratory findings to consequential mathematics learning with diverse learners. The team will focus on two areas of research in the cognitive science of learning that have that have important implications for learning complex domains like mathematics and science. The first is perceptual learning, which accelerates learners' abilities to quickly and accurately recognize key structures, patterns, and relationships. The second area is the development of adaptive learning algorithms that utilize real-time performance data in conjunction with principles of learning to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning by tailoring the learning process to each individual student. This project is designed both to advance the scientific understanding of perceptual and adaptive learning and to assess their potential to improve learning in community college mathematics.<br/><br/>Several sets of experiments will investigate basic scientific questions regarding 1) whether and how there may be a unified account of the benefits of spacing of learning events that applies across different forms of learning; 2) how intermixing passive and interactive events may improve adaptive learning; and 3) how adaptive methods may be used to enhance the role and benefits of comparisons in perceptual learning. Basic principles will be established through research in controlled laboratory studies. The project will then extend these findings by conducting applied tests of these principles to optimize the effectiveness, efficiency, and durability of learning, and to maintain motivation, with community college students enrolled in remedial mathematics courses. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

It is hypothesized that the QT model will enhance pre- and in-service secondary teachers' development of professional vision and leadership skills necessary for 21st century STEM education. Over the course of four years, the work will address critical needs in physics and chemistry education in 10th through 12th grade classrooms in five of Georgia's high-need school districts by strengthening the capacity of participating teachers to design and implement lessons that support effective dialogic interactions. As a result of such interactions, students' scientific literacy will be enhanced, including their ability to participate in content-rich discourse (i.e., QT) through effective disciplinary critical-analytic thinking and epistemic cognition. The contributions of this project, beyond the tangible benefits for teacher and student participants, include the development, refinement, and dissemination of an effective QT intervention and professional developmental framework that the entire science education community can use to promote scientific literacy and understanding. <br/><br/>The project goals are being achieved through a series of three studies employing complementary methods and data sources, and a focus upon dissemination of the model in the final project year. The first two years of the project focus on developing and refining the curricular and intervention efficacy materials using design-based research methods. In Year 3, the project engages in a quasi-experimental study of the refined QT model, followed by further refinements before disseminating the materials both within Georgia and throughout the national science education community in Year 4. Quantitative measures of teacher and student discourse and knowledge, as well as video-coding and qualitative investigations of intervention efficacy, are being analyzed using multiple methods. In collaboration with, but independent from project staff and stakeholders, the participatory and responsive evaluation utilizes a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation.  <br/><br/>Over the course of four years, the project will involve the participation of approximately 32 teachers in Georgia whose students include substantive percentages from populations underrepresented in the STEM fields. In addition to advancing their own students' scientific literacy, these participating teachers receive professional development on how to train other teachers, outside of the project, in using QT to promote scientific literacy. Further, the project will conduct a QT Summit for educational stakeholders and non-participant teachers to disseminate the intervention and professional development model. Finally, the project team will disseminate the findings widely to applied and scholarly communities through a website with materials and PD information (http://www.qualitytalk.org), professional journals, conferences, and NSF's DRK-12 Resource Network. This project, with its focus on teacher leadership and the pedagogical content knowledge necessary to use discourse to promote student science literacy, significantly advances the nation's goals of producing critical consumers and producers of scientific knowledge."

Hypotheses regarding the relationships between parents' race-related experiences and beliefs (i.e., racial discrimination, knowledge of inequalities, racial identity, and endorsement of race stereotypes) and the academic socialization of their children will be tested. Differences in these processes by child gender and ability will be examined.  <br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit is its potential to advance understanding about STEM success for underrepresented youth. The focus will yield new insights in an area where African American youth are likely to face negative stereotypes and discriminatory treatment, and where most prior research has focused on classroom processes rather than parenting. Broader impacts of the work are in the realms of education and training; inclusion of under-represented groups; and dissemination to teachers, families, the public, and to the scientific community."

One such example is the emergency response team transporting and handing over a patient to a hospital emergency department trauma team, however, multiteam behavioral tracking systems and the process of designing and developing them for smart, connected communities are applicable to other team-based contexts. Learning and coordination across multiple teams to prepare for an emergency or crisis response is crucial to prevent mistakes and to protect citizen health and safety. <br/><br/>This research builds upon a proof of concept, mobile-based behavioral sensing system tested in real world conditions to connect learning, behavior and performance among multiple teams in a high fidelity simulation through establishing and modeling meaningful protocols toward improved sensor-based measurement, real-time data analysis and actionable insights for smart connected communities and the well-being of their citizens. This research will provide an unprecedented level of insight into multiteam behavior, transition points, and learning by participants. Processes to model and measure meaningful team-based interaction and activity will be addressed to identify metrics that matter in gauging multi-team performance. The researchers will study and leverage mobile behavioral sensing techniques and utilize sociotechnical analysis connected to real-time visualization techniques to aid multi-team learning. This research will link interdisciplinary perspectives in the learning sciences, behavioral sciences, engineering, data analytics and human factors to iteratively refine and test a system with potential to transform feedback and actionable insight for multiteam training contexts."

However, there is a risk that some of the same inequities that exist in the engineering field are being replicated in these settings. Research has provided evidence of persistent gaps between boys' and girls' levels of interest in engineering as it has been traditionally represented in informal learning environments, particularly in Making and engineering spaces. This Research-In-Service to Practice project intends to address this gap by employing a design-based research approach to examine if and to what extent narrative elements can interest and engage middle school girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and promote equitable, effective engineering design experiences and practices. This work is significant, as it will build upon current research and conceptual understanding of how to design narrative-rich engineering design activities for informal learning spaces, especially for girls, and within museum drop-in experiential learning contexts. It will also contribute to the evidence base regarding how girls approach and choose to persist in solving engineering design problems. The project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The New York Hall of Science (NYSCI) in collaboration with the Amazeum in Bentonville, Arkansas, the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California, the Creativity Labs at Indiana University and a team of advisors will conduct the 30-month, design-based research project in two phases. In the first phase, NYSCI will garner ongoing input from its partners to develop parallel versions of six pairs of engineering design activities, one with narrative elements and one without. These activities will be iteratively tested in NYSCI's Design Lab, a 10,000 square foot exhibition devoted to hands-on exploration of engineering design.  Several research questions will be explored, focused primarily on building evidence-based design knowledge, establishing appeal and comprehensibility, and understanding facilitation. Observational and interview data will be garnered from 30 girls aged 7-14 and their family groups for each of the twelve activities developed, totaling 360 girls in the study sample. The results of the research on the paired activities will be iterative and provide insight on how narrative elements can most effectively invite girls into sustained engagement with the core engineering concepts and practices highlighted in each activity. In the second phase, formative and summative evaluation will be conducted to study the impact of the narrative and non-narrative versions of the engineering design activities on participating girls' engagement and persistence, by contrasting the quality of girls' engagement across the two types of activities while they are implemented across three museum sites.  Project deliverables include journal articles reporting on project findings; documentation of activities that meet project goals; design guidelines for exhibit and curriculum developers who are interested in using narrative effectively to frame engineering design activities; and practical guidance for facilitators seeking to ensure that they are supporting girls effectively as they explore those activities."

Previous research has suggested that when students are taught genetics in particular ways, it increases faulty assumptions. For example, learning about the prevalence of sickle cell anemia in people of African descent and the prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis in people of European descent can cause middle and high school students to infer that racial groups vary in intelligence, academic ability, and science ability because of genetics. Conversely, educational interventions which teach students that there is more genetic variation within races rather than between them can reduce the belief that genes cause racial groups to differ in their intellectual, academic, and science abilities. What is still unknown is why does human genetics education cause these changes in racial bias during adolescence? Using experimental, quasi-experimental, and qualitative research methods, this research will identify the cognitive, social, and educational factors that link the learning of human genetics to reductions in racial bias. In doing so, this project will explore how learning about human difference in the biology classroom affects how adolescents view people of different races outside of the classroom. Consequently, this work could help educators understand how to teach about the science of human difference in a socially-responsible manner. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>This project will investigate factors that mediate and/or moderate the impact of an anti-essentialist genetics education on explicit and implicit forms of racial bias during adolescence. Genetic essentialism of race is a psychological bias which leads people to underestimate the actual genetic variability that exists within races and to overestimate the genetic variability that exists between races. Studies have established that this bias is implicated in the development of racial stereotyping and prejudice across human development and across cultures in Western societies.  Essentialism is also associated with misconceptions about biological variation and evolution. The links between essentialism, racial bias, and biological misconceptions are due, in part, to the fact that essentialist worldviews are inconsistent with biological theory and data. This project will explore the enactment of an anti-essentialist genetics intervention in the context of middle and high school biology classrooms to understand whether and how this intervention reduces implicit and explicit forms of racial bias. The work will center on the implementation of an existing anti-essentialist genetics education intervention which has been shown to reduce explicit forms of racial bias among adolescents. In phase one, the project will use think-aloud protocols and qualitative methods to identify the social and cognitive factors which moderate how students reason in response to intervention materials. In phase two, a comparative interrupted time series, focus groups with students, and video-based analyses of the teaching of the intervention will be used to identify social and cognitive variables that are potential mediators of intervention effects on racial bias. In phase three, an individually randomized trial with clustering will be used to test pre-registered mediating and/or moderating mechanisms that link the intervention to reductions in implicit and explicit racial bias.  During each phase of the study, developing knowledge of the causal mechanism will be used to revise the intervention materials to make them more effective at increasing genetic literacy and reducing racial bias among adolescents."

Why do women thrive in some STEM classrooms and drop out of others, and how does this impact whether they will continue on in a STEM major? While much previous research focuses on the role of overt prejudice and stereotyping, the ways in which subtler, situational cues within STEM classes shape women's experiences have remained largely unexplored. This CAREER research project begins with premise that STEM professors' beliefs about students' math and science abilities (termed faculty mindsets) serve as situational cues that are communicated in STEM classrooms and significantly influence women's experiences in these fields. By examining how fixed and growth mindsets are communicated to students and how they shape the learning climate of STEM classes, this project will integrate research and teaching by creating and evaluating feasible and practical pedagogical strategies that stoke women's persistence and performance in STEM. This project is poised to shape best practices about how STEM faculty could communicate better with students in their classrooms to support the motivation and performance of all students--improving STEM education and educator development. Based on the experience-sampling, longitudinal, and experimental research that comprise this research plan, the research team will create and evaluate empirically based recommendations and intervention materials. These faculty tools and videos will be broadly disseminated and made publically available to multiple stakeholders including researchers, educators, practitioners, and lay citizens.<br/><br/>Specifically, this multi-method proposal uses 2 longitudinal and experience-sampling studies, 6 experiments, and a growth mindset intervention with STEM faculty to identify the cues that connote faculty mindsets and shape women's interest, aspirations, persistence, and performance. The experience-sampling and longitudinal studies provide essential, ecologically valid data about women in natural classroom settings, while the lab experiments provide rigorous tests of the causal mechanisms underlying the findings. Most notably, the proposed research is the first to conceptualize and directly examine the messages that signal faculty mindsets, their influence on women's science and math outcomes, and to design and evaluate an intervention aimed at facilitating growth mindset messages in STEM learning environments. The research extends the idea of mindsets from an individual difference to a contextual, structural factor in classroom environments. The research is transformative in that it identifies a new, structural barrier to women's full participation in STEM fields (fixed ability cues in STEM classrooms), investigates the processes by which those cues stifle the motivation and performance of women in STEM, and evaluates an intervention aimed at mitigating that barrier by introducing growth mindset cues that support the motivation and performance of all students. Together, these studies press forward the frontier of knowledge as they provide novel insights about how equitable and inviting STEM environments can be created."

Students in this program are immersed in engineering design activities requiring the application of science and mathematics principles.  The program model includes pre-engineering courses in computer science, computer aided drafting, and electronics. These are designed and facilitated by university faculty. Undergraduate seniors are trained by faculty and then serve as mentors. Engineering design activities, career orientation activities and robotics summer camps for elementary and middle school students are facilitated by high school faculty.  At the beginning of the spring semester, students participate in an international robotics competition.  This robotics program is year-long and occurs after school, and halfway through the year students enter their designs in a robotics competition.  Beginning in the freshmen year, students are allowed to remain in the program throughout their years in high school. An understanding of the components that positively influence the African American students' beliefs about their abilities in STEM disciplines and their perceptions of their identification with STEM could be useful for understanding and decreasing the gap in STEM majors that exists with students from underserved populations in the United States.  <br/><br/>This longitudinal mixed methods research study is designed to investigate the influence of engineering design and career orientation activities implemented in a collaborative robotics/pre-engineering program on African American students' self-efficacy, and scientific identity, to better understand factors influencing their achievement in STEM disciplines and orientation to STEM majors.  This is a four year study, allowing the researchers to follow a group of students from freshman to the end of their senior year, so that key factors influencing the students' learning and achievement in the engineering course activities can be observed and documented during the peak years of decision making for college majors and careers.  This study is unique in terms of its location and population of students, and because it is longitudinal and utilizes a mixed methods approach.   While this study investigates the effectiveness of the program on the engineering self-efficacy, scientific identity and achievement of program objectives for students in this program, the findings of the study could also be valuable for informing initiatives devoted to increasing the numbers of students from other marginalized groups majoring in STEM fields. Quantitatively, this research employs pre and post measures to determine changes in students engineering self-efficacy and scientific identities.   Qualitatively, field notes from classroom observations and interviews with the high school students provide data on specific program elements determined to be effective in positively influencing the African American students' achievement of program objectives and decisions to pursue STEM careers."

ITEST seeks to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To be globally competitive, the US must optimize the available workforce to include women in STEM. There are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed in engaging women in engineering: motivation and preparedness to pursue STEM careers. The Academy of Natural Sciences will partner with Drexel University: College of Engineering and School of Education, and local engineering professionals, through the Engineering WINS (EngWINS) program. EngWINS will develop the capabilities of working engineers and faculty to serve as mentors in a new initiative to develop interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering careers among urban high school women. The project's immediate impacts extend from an out-of-school learning environment and into urban academic and industrial research centers. The workforce development would be fueled by: 1) diversifying the STEM pipeline, 2) supporting the advancement of all women in STEM fields, and 3) studying the impacts of EngWINS training among adult mentors. The project findings will have relevance for human resource practices in higher education and industry and will be disseminated among educators in engineering in both academic and out of school settings. <br/><br/>Project research will investigate how and to what extent a largely homogeneous group of working engineers can enter mentoring relationships that increase participation in their field by underrepresented populations. The project goals, scope, methods, and approaches will address the following questions: To what extent does training in culturally responsive pedagogies and anti-discriminatory frameworks shift adult mentors, mindsets, and dispositions toward their work with EngWINS students, as well as in other teaching contexts or workplace interactions with women and minorities?  To what extent do pairings of mentors and mentees from different backgrounds influence students' interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering education and careers? To what extent does interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering differ between EngWINS students who have a mentor versus. those who only experience the regular EngWINS curriculum?  The projects will use mixed-methods and quasi-experimental design. There will be multiple data sources such as classroom observations, interviews, and surveys/assessments to measure student and mentor outcomes. The project will enroll adult mentor candidates into a full year of professional development training in culturally relevant pedagogies, ways to combat stereotype barriers, and implicit biases, prior to entering mentoring relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

American youth are ill-prepared relative to their international counterparts - U.S. 15 year olds rank 16 out of 26 developed countries in science literacy and 19 out of 26 developed counties in mathematical literacy. There is much research in the areas of how students learn STEM in formal settings, but there is little knowledge of the impact of youth contexts on STEM. Youth contexts are social groups in the lives of young people such as neighborhoods, communities, schools, classrooms or friends. Understanding the role of youth contexts is crucial to ensuring that all students have the opportunity to learn STEM content. This project will synthesize the research literature on youth context and assess whether and how a range of these contexts shape K-12 STEM outcomes and engagement - predictors critical for later educational and occupational attainment. The researchers will conduct two large-scale meta-analyses - one based on the quantitative research body and one based on the qualitative research body - in order to draw conclusions about which contextual factors relate to which STEM outcomes across the span of extant research. In doing so, this synthesis project will inform educators and policymakers about the cumulative evidence that exists on the impacts of a variety of contextual factors on a multitude of STEM outcomes (e.g., math and science achievement, self-efficacy, future goals). This project will provide new evidence regarding the significance of youth contexts on STEM outcomes that will assist policy makers and educators in evaluating productive educational environments. <br/><br/>Syntheses of the research in youth contexts and their impact in STEM will address the following four research questions: (1) How do contextual factors impact STEM learning?; (2) How do these factors vary by the specific type of context?; (3) How do these factors vary by gender and race within each context?; and, (4) Are these factors influenced by the methodological features of the research? The review will include electronic searches of educational, economics, sociology, psychology, and general science databases covering the years 1980-2014. Results will be narrowed by youth context area, and separate analysis will be conducted on gender and race/ethnicity differences in STEM outcomes. The data for the full review will be evaluated by a common set of guidelines to be published along with the findings, enabling the conclusions of the review to be transparent and allowing for detailed information to be easily accessible. The review will discuss each study that meets the inclusion requirements for a valid research design. With this methodology, this study will be the first to provide a clearinghouse of rigorous research related to contextual factors of STEM outcomes"

A core strength of the SEP model is its integration with the implementation of the Perkins Act (Perkins 2006), which funds improvement of career and technical education (CTE) at the state and local level, and includes an accountability measure requiring all recipients to increase the participation and completion of underrepresented students in nontraditional CTE programs (i.e. women in STEM). The project will apply the Program Improvement Process for Equity in STEM (PIPE-STEM) model that incorporates performance gap analysis, identification of root causes aligned with research-based strategies, and evaluation to measure outcomes to sustain change in educational systems. <br/><br/>An Extension Services Group (ESG) of gender equity in STEM research and practice experts will provide consulting and professional development services to state extension service agents (SESAs) made up of education professionals that provide technical assistance and professional development to high school and community college educators. SESAs will be trained to provide extension services using the suite of SEP professional development programs via: (1) a train-the-trainer institute; (2) an annual conference where best practices will be shared; (2) professional development webinars; (3) a Virtual Learning Community and (4) on-going consulting. Other unique features of the model include: recruitment and vetting process for new states, a tested organizational structure; experienced trainers, training methods and content; a refined institutional change process; guidance for improving data-driven decisions using Perkins data; research-based resources on women in STEM programs of study and promising practices; and a focus on formal education. Each of these capacities has been customized and refined for greater effectiveness while working with staff in State Departments of Education and local education agencies. The process is focused on systematically examining and understanding what barriers women face to participation in STEM related programs of study rather than jumping to conclusions and implementing a flawed ?silver bullet? solution. The process ensures that State Teams will invest time and effort in providing consulting, professional development and technical assistance that leads to the implementation of improvement strategies that actually achieve measurable results. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: SEP 2.0 will increase the number of states served from 12 to 22 and more than double its reach beyond the current 2690 extension agents already trained. The STEM Equity Pipeline's suite of professional development programs includes its signature institutional change model, PIPE-STEM, featuring improvements based on feedback, and two new professional development programs: Micro-messaging to Reach and Teach Every Student, teacher training on classroom-based effective instructional practices; and STEM Equity Counselor training, focused on effective recruitment and career development strategies. Integral to all the SEP professional development is the research on the intersection of gender and other factors such as race, culture, disability, and socio-economic status and their influence on women and girl?s access and success in STEM education and transition to STEM careers."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. In alignment with these aims, the University of Washington will design and pilot an innovative leadership development program, NextGen Broadening Participation in ISE Professional Learning Program, to develop the leadership capacity of mid-career professionals, primarily from underrepresented groups in STEM, whose work focuses on broadening participation in informal STEM education (ISE). Unlike most existing ISE leadership models, this pathways project will employ a bottom-up, iterative design approach to engage program participants and garner new insights. Formative data and analysis will be used to better understand the broadening participation context, inform the model, and develop strategies and resources necessary to best support a more diversified next generation of ISE leaders. This pilot study is timely and significant. There is currently a substantial dearth of literature on the intersection between broadening participation and mid-level professional leadership development. Likewise, there are few comparable models in the current AISL portfolio. As such, the findings from this pilot will address critical gaps in the AISL portfolio and in the field, at large. It has the potential to markedly transform the capacity and impact of next generation ISE leaders. <br/><br/>Over an eighteen-month period, this feasibility study will design, implement and test key aspects of the model to determine its potential for short and long term success.

This Industry-Informed STEM Pathways for Students is a project concerned with underrepresentation of people of color and women in STEM fields. It uses a student-centered approach to investigate the ITEST guiding questions related to: motivation and preparedness to pursue STEM careers, instructional and curricular innovations, and partnerships with business and industry. The Boston Plan for Excellence, in collaboration with the Education Development Center and Boston-based STEM industry partners will design, develop, study, and iterate on three industry-informed STEM pathways for 300 students in grades 9-12: electrical engineering, digital design, and computer programming. The significance and importance of the project is large-scale studies of within-school career academies and inclusive STEM high schools that suggest that school-based career pathways may be a promising strategy for boosting STEM career interest and other educational and life outcomes among underrepresented groups. Few interventions to date have attempted to build such pathways within a non-selective school to serve a student population that: (a) includes mostly low-income students of color, many of whom are English learners, (b) has not expressed interest in STEM, and (c) might have gaps in prior STEM knowledge. Therefore, there is little knowledge about how career pathways might be implemented with a wider range of populations, or how components (e.g. coursework, internships) relate to students' interest in and capacity to pursue STEM careers. Moreover, few studies have tracked students over time to understand how their STEM interests and capacity have been shaped by various pathway elements. Informed by research on STEM-focused high schools, career pathways, and social cognitive career theory, this project has the potential to advance knowledge of how schools can develop and sustain STEM interest and capacity among students from underrepresented groups who may have gaps in STEM and/or language preparation. <br/><br/>Each pathway in electrical engineering, digital design, and computer programming will include an aligned sequence of technology-rich, project-based courses, internships, career talks, company tours, and job readiness workshops. Using design research methodology, the partners will examine the relationships between: (a) career pathway design, (b) students' experiences, and (c) students' STEM interest and capacity within a non-selective, open-enrollment urban public STEM school in Boston. By focusing on the organization of student experiences using a pathway approach, the partners will begin to answer the question: What are the essential components of a successful industry-informed STEM career pathway in a non-selective, urban public STEM school, wherein success results in students graduating with the interest and capacity to fill workforce needs in Boston's STEM-driven economy? The neighborhood-based Dearborn STEM Academy draws a large Cape Verdean and immigrant population from Dorchester and Roxbury., 66% of students are English learners and 75% are from low-income families. Local STEM companies will help design the project, create industry-based experiences for students, and broaden participation in STEM workplaces by youth who are female, Black, Latino, and/or from low-income families. Data collection will include surveying all students each year, as well as multi-year longitudinal data collection (focus groups, observations, classroom assessments) for two student cohorts.

An ongoing challenge for mathematics teachers is promoting deep mathematics learning among linguistically diverse groups of students while taking into consideration how students' language background influences their classroom experiences and the mathematical understandings they develop. In response to this challenge, this project will design and develop specialized instructional materials and guidelines  for teaching fundamental topics in secondary algebra in linguistically diverse classrooms. The materials will incorporate insights from current research on student learning in mathematics as well as insights from research on the role of language in students' mathematical thinking and learning. A significant contribution of the work will be connecting research on mathematics learning generally with research on the mathematics learning of English language learners. In addition to advancing theoretical understandings, the research will also contribute practical resources and guidance for mathematics teachers who teach English language learners. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the design of specialized hypothetical learning trajectories that incorporate considerations for linguistically diverse students. One goal for the specialized trajectories is to foster productive and powerful mathematics discussions about linear and exponential rates in linguistically diverse classrooms. The specialized learning trajectories will include both mathematical and language development learning goals. While this project focuses on concepts related to reasoning with linear and exponential functions, the resulting framework should inform the design of specialized hypothetical learning trajectories in other topic areas. Additionally, the project will add to the field?s  understanding of how linguistically diverse students develop mathematical understandings of a key conceptual domain. The project uses a design-based research framework gathering classroom-based data, assessment data, and interviews with teachers and students to design and refine the learning trajectories. Consistent with a design-based approach, the project results will include development of theory about linguistically diverse students' mathematics learning and development of guidance and resources for secondary mathematics teachers. This research involves sustained collaboration with secondary mathematics teachers and the impacts will include developing capacity of teachers locally, and propagating the results of this work in professional development activities."

Much work has been done in this regard. Yet, underrepresentation in STEM fields persists and is especially pronounced for Hispanic STEM professionals. The Hispanic community is the youngest and fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States but comprises only seven percent of the STEM workforce. More evidence-based solutions and innovative approaches are required. This project endeavors to address the challenges of underrepresentation in STEM, especially among individuals of Hispanic descent, through an innovative approach. The University of San Diego will design, develop, implement, and test a multilayered STEM learning approach specific to STEM learning and workforce development in STEM fields targeting Hispanic youth. The STEM World of Work project will explore youth STEM identity through three mechanisms: (1) an assessment of their individual interests, strengths, and values, (2) exposure to an array of viable STEM careers, and (3) engagement in rigorous hands-on STEM activities. The project centers on a youth summer STEM enrichment program and a series of follow-up booster sessions delivered during the academic year in informal contexts to promote family engagement. Paramount to this work is the core focus on San Diego's Five Priority Workforce Sectors: Advanced Manufacturing, Information and Communications Technology, Clean Energy, Healthcare, and Biotech. Few, if any, existing projects in the Advancing Informal STEM learning portfolio have explored the potential connections between these five priority workforce sectors, informal STEM learning, and identity among predominately Hispanic youth and families engaged in a year-long, culturally responsive STEM learning and workforce focused program. If successful, the model could provide a template for the facilitation of similar efforts in the future.<br/><br/>The STEM World of Work project will use a mixed-methods, exploratory research design to better understand the variables influencing STEM learning and academic and career choices within the proposed context. The research questions will explore: (1) the impacts of the project on students' engagement, STEM identity, STEM motivation, and academic outcomes, (2) factors that moderate these outcomes, and (3) the impact the model has on influencing youths' personal goals and career choices. Data will be garnered through cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and reflective focus groups with the students and their parents/guardians. Multivariate analysis of variance, longitudinal modeling, and qualitative analysis will be conducted to analyze and report the data. The findings will be disseminated using a variety of methods and platforms. The broader impacts of the findings and work are expected to extend well beyond the project team, graduate student mentors, project partners, and the estimated 120 middle school students and their families from the predominately Hispanic Chula Vista Community of San Diego who will be directly impacted by the project. <br/><br/>This exploratory pathways project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

Employing a novel design and development approach, this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will test the feasibility of integrating Making concepts with real world micro-manufacturing engineering principles within the context of intense, multi-year team apprenticeship experiences for high school students. The apprenticeship model is particularly novel, as current Making research and experiences predominately take place in afterschool and summer programs for up to 25 youth. The proposed apprenticeships will require a two year commitment by a small cohort of Texas high school students, which will provide an opportunity to examine the feasibility and impact of the effort longitudinally. The cohort will learn to think critically, solve problems, and work together as a Making Production Team (MPT) in a customized makerspace in their high school, constructing engineering-based science kits for implementation in a local elementary school.  Not only will the students enhance their content knowledge while developing design and development skills but the students will also receive stipends which will address two very practical needs for the targeted high need population - employment and workforce development. Few, if any, efforts currently serve the targeted population through the contextualization of Making within a supply chain management and micro-manufacturing framework that extends the Making experience by integrating the student designed products into elementary classrooms.  As such, this project will contribute to essentially unexplored areas of Making research and development. <br/><br/>Six high school students from high poverty, underserved Texas communities along the Texas-Mexico border (colonias) will be selected for the Making Production Team (MPT). In Years 1 and 2, the students will meet regularly during the academic school year and over the summer with Texas A & M University undergraduates, graduate students, and the project team to learn key aspects of Making and manufacturing (i.e., ideation, prototyping, design, acquisition, personnel, and production) through hands-on making activities and direct instruction. Concurrently, a research study will be conducted to explore: (a) the actualization of the model in an underserved community, (b) the effectiveness of problem-based learning to train students in the model, and (c) STEM knowledge and self-concept. Data will be collected from multiple sources. An adapted version of the Academic Self-Description Questionnaire will be administered to the students to assess their STEM technical knowledge and skills as well as their self-concept in relation to STEM domains. Remote and in person interviews will be conducted with the students to track the evolution of the primary dependent variables, STEM learning and self-concept, over time. Program facilitators and partners will be interviewed to examine the feasibility of the making experience within the given context and for the targeted students. Finally, the students' diary reflections, products, and video recordings of their work sessions will also be examined. Time-series quantitative tests and in-depth qualitative methods will be used to analyze the data."

In today's educational climate, organizations are creating physical learning spaces for hands-on STEM activities, often called  makerspaces, co-working spaces, innovation labs, or fablabs. These spaces have evolved to be interdisciplinary centers that personalize learning for individual, diverse learners in collaborative settings. When designed well, these physical spaces create communities that contextualize learning around participants' goals and thus address STEM learning in a dynamic and integrated way. Participation in these learning environments encourages the cultivation of STEM identities for young people and can positively direct their career trajectories into STEM fields. This workshop will bring together a community of collaborators from multiple stakeholder groups including academia, public libraries, museums, community based organizations, non-profits, media makers and distribution channels, and educators within and beyond K-12 schools. Led by the University of Arizona, and held at Biosphere 2, an international research facility, participants will engage in activities that invite experimentation with distributed learning technologies to examine ways to adapt learning to the changing technological landscape and create robust, dynamic online learning environments. The workshop will culminate in a synthesis of design principles, assessment approaches, and tools that will be shared widely. Partnerships arising from the workshop will pave the way for sustained efforts in this area that span research and practice communities. Outcomes will address research and development of the next generation of digitally distributed learning environments. <br/><br/>The three day workshop convening will provide a unique forum to (1) exchange innovative ideas and share challenges and opportunities, (2) connect practical and research-based expertise and (3) form cross-institutional and cross-community partnerships that envision, propose, and implement opportunities for collecting and analyzing data to systematically inform the collective understanding. Participation-based activities will include design-based experiences, participatory activities, demonstrations of works in progress, prototyping, creative pitching, practitioner lightning talks, small group breakouts, hands-on design activities, and an 'unconference' style synthesis of bold ideas. Participants will be invited to experiment with distributed learning technologies. Five focus areas for the workshop include (1) inclusivity of learning spaces that invite multiple perspectives and full participation, (2) documenting learning in ways that are linked to outcomes and impacts for all learners, (3) implementing the use of new technologies in diverse settings, such as the workforce, (4) interpersonal interactions and peer-to-peer learning that may encourage a STEM career-path, and, (5) methods for collecting and analyzing data at the intersection of people, the learning environment, and new technologies at multiple levels.  Outcomes of the workshop will serve to advance knowledge regarding critical gaps and opportunities and identify and characterize models of collaboration, networking, and innovation that operate within and across studio-based STEM learning environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of its fundamental focus on collaborative, iterative, process-based learning--key 21st century skills--maker education's learning outcomes cannot be adequately tracked by tests, the traditional means of assessment in classrooms. The project will develop embedded assessment techniques, co-designed with and implemented by teachers, to collect rigorous forms of evidence of student learning, without constraining or interrupting complex making processes. Embedded assessment refers to a form of assessment where assessment is directly incorporated into the learning environments and activities, so student learning can be monitored and supported in real time. Embedded assessment has been widely adopted in digital contexts to design tasks within a system that can elicit evidence of desired outcomes, and to automatically and rapidly capture rich data generated in the process of performance. Leveraging the same methodology in maker learning is promising, however hands-on learning environments do not have the same data affordances as digital environments. Through this necessary reframing and redesigning of assessment, we can begin to answer the question of how maker-centered learning can truly benefit the broader education system, both for students and for teachers. This knowledge will improve the quality of learning in school-based maker environments, and enable more schools to bring these valuable experiences to their students.<br/><br/>The project will develop and evaluate practices of embedded assessment in maker-centered learning which will lead to assessment practices better suited to the processes and desired outcomes of maker education. There are currently no well-documented assessment protocols or processes for maker education. The project will conduct design-based research that involves two lines of connected work. First, the project will iteratively develop embedded assessment toolkits with maker educators and teachers. Second, the project will establish a transformative process where participating teachers can successfully adopt embedded assessments within middle school STEM curricula."

While integrating content has been suggested as a strategy for students' learning, there has been limited investigation about how mathematics and computational thinking should be connected in learning experiences. Computational thinking is an essential skill for STEM careers including concepts such as algorithms and programming, data collection and analysis, using abstractions, and problem solving. These computational thinking concepts and practices can be related to mathematics concepts. This project will examine how to design learning modules that place mathematics concepts. By exploring how different kinds of designs support learning and engagement, the project will establish a set of design principles for supporting mathematical and computational thinking. The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Using design-based research as a methodology to support iterative design and research, the project will explore two core tensions that are relevant to the integration of mathematics and computational thinking. Each tension deals with how to balance competing goals, and investigates the influence of foregrounding one goal over another. Specifically, the project will design, test, and begin to apply in schools a set of modules that contrast: 1) foregrounding mathematics vs. computational thinking; and 2) foregrounding agency vs. structure. The model of implementation includes two summers of camp sessions for middle school students, and a year of implementation in classrooms, thus allowing exploration beyond the potential for math and computational thinking to be integrated, and extending into what such integration looks like in the institutional context of schools.  The research questions to be investigated include: (1) What are the advantages of modules that teach mathematics through computational thinking (foregrounding mathematics) vs. those that teach computational thinking through mathematics (foregrounding computational thinking)? (2) What are the advantages of modules that teach computational thinking through open exploration (agency) vs. game play (structure)? (3) What kinds of instructional supports do math teachers need or request as they are teaching students at the intersection of computational thinking and mathematics? The project will result in (a) a set of instructional sequences for middle school that propose productive intersections of computational thinking and mathematics, (b) an understanding of how and why these instructional sequences support diverse participation, and (c) conjectures about the support math teachers need to integrate computational thinking in their classrooms. Different sections for students will be created to compare different conditions that will foreground mathematics, computational thinking, structure or agency. Data collected will include measures of student learning, interviews, analysis of student work, and video analysis to examine student engagement and interest."

The goal of the project is to use assessment data and videos of classroom teaching in order to create a tool that can be used to document effective instructional practices. This observation tool can then be used to support teacher professional development in early algebra and research about how teachers' actions can be linked to students' learning.

Second, to what extent do these profiles of effective instructional practices vary by grade level? The primary product of the work is an early algebra observation protocol that will capture non-domain and non-grade level specific practices of effective teaching in combination with practices specific to early algebra. Videos of early algebra classrooms will be used to design the observation protocol, which in turn, will then be used along with student assessment data to identify profiles of instructional practices associated with students' learning. Multiple phases of testing and revision will be used to create the observation protocol.

Further, little is known about how teachers' and students' conceptions of engineering relate to aspects of their local community such as language and culture. Knowing more about this is important because students' perceptions of mismatch between their personal culture and the engineering field contributes to the continued underrepresentation of minorities in the profession. This mixed-method exploratory study will examine how bilingual teachers working in elementary schools in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico understand the role and skills of engineers in society. In turn, it will examine how teachers adapt existing engineering lessons so that those activities and concepts are more culturally and linguistically accessible to their students. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Consistent with the aims of the DRK-12 program, this project will advance understanding of how engineering education materials can be adapted to the characteristics of teachers, students, and the communities that they reside in. Further, its focus on bilingual classrooms will bring new perspectives to characterizations of the engineering field and its role in different cultures and societies. Over a three-year period, the team will investigate these issues by collecting data from 24 teachers (12 from each location). Data will be collected via surveys, interviews, discussion of instructional examples, videos of teachers' classroom instruction and analysis of artifacts such as teachers' lesson plans. Teachers will collaborate and function as a professional co-learning community called instructional rounds by participating and providing feedback synchronously in face-to-face settings and via the use of digital apps. Project findings can lead to teaching guidelines, practices, and briefs that inform efforts to successfully integrate bilingual engineering curriculum at the elementary grades. This work also has the potential to create professional development models of success for K-5 teachers in bilingual programs and enhance engineering teaching strategies and methods at these early grade levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, it touches on three of the ITEST Program's focal areas: (1) investigating coherent sets of experiences that support student competency; (2) modeling the roles business and industry workforce member's play in motivating students; and (3) develop examples of productive ways to support broadening participation through industry/afterschool partnerships.<br/><br/>Biotechnology, and genetics in particular, are rapidly advancing areas that will offer new jobs across the spectrum from technicians to scientists. Each year, U.S. companies spend nearly a billion dollars on STEM education programs. Yet we lack research-based models for engaging students with industry professionals to further their awareness of STEM careers and help them learn the content these careers demand. This three-year ITEST Strategies project, GeniConnect, focuses on middle school student engagement in genetics and biotechnology using game-based learning (Geniverse). With guidance and mentoring from industry professionals, research scientists, and community volunteers, 150 diverse students from Cambridge, MA will participate in an eight-week afterschool program.  Students will also conduct hands-on experiments at the Biogen Idec Community Lab while becoming familiar with STEM careers. <br/><br/>The project framework will be guided by an evidence-centered design, aligned with project activities intended to develop better models to sustain successful industry and afterschool partnerships. Two key research questions guide the investigation: (1) How can a suite of experiences involving game-based learning, laboratory activities and mentoring by industry professionals foster student understanding and motivation in genetics and biotechnology and further student awareness of careers and real-world connections? This question forms the iterative design and pilot study components of the research. Analysis will help the team understand both foundational concepts needed for understanding modern genetics and the dimensions of motivation concerning students' feelings of relevance, personal interest and self-efficacy toward genetics and biotechnology; and (2) What methods and processes can aid industry groups and afterschool programs in forming meaningful and productive partnerships? This question forms the feasibility research. It explores the essential aspects of STEM professionals' engagement, preparation and relationship building with afterschool groups as well as how participation and program design aspects are valued. Data collection strategies will include survey, log data from the Geniverse platform, focus groups, and in-depth interviews; outcome measures will center on content knowledge, motivation, value, interest and self-efficacy. The contexts for research and design will be the home and afterschool program.<br/><br/>Project partners include the Concord Consortium, a nonprofit with extensive experience researching and developing STEM educational technology; Purdue University; and East End House, a nonprofit community-based organization serving under-resourced youth in Cambridge, MA. Project results will inform not only the research community of the design and delivery of effective afterschool STEM programs for career awareness and learning, but also supply afterschool programs and industry partners with a pathway for success. Using this framework, the project will create a STEM Partnership Toolkit to be distributed to approximately 500 community-based organizations and afterschool programs nationally that are member organizations of the Alliance for Strong Families and Communities."

The project will design and develop a web-based form of professional development and teacher education for learning and teaching algebra in middle school. The project is a 4-year Design and Development project within the Teaching Strand.  Forty modules are planned that will provide focus and structure to an online professional development experience. These modules follow an explicit learning trajectory in which a video clip is used in the middle of an online teacher learning experience composed of mathematical problem solving, video analysis of classroom practice, and pedagogical reflection. Within each module activity, a teacher experiences a consistent set of activities. Before and after teachers watch each video clip, they engage in activities designed to immerse them deeply in both the mathematics content and the focal instructional components. The study has the potential to advance the knowledge of the use of educational data mining into the research and development of teacher education materials. In researching both the design and impact of the materials this project may offer implications for others interested in designing online professional development and teacher education materials. The Discovery Research preK-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools.

The study investigates the design and impact of the materials which can support others who are interested in designing digital professional development. The project will employ the use of data analytics to discover what video-based modules users choose to use first, the sequence in which they use the modules, and the modules they don't choose. The modules will include three delivery formats to meet the variety of teacher learning needs (individual self-paced, group-paced, facilitated/structured course) and offer flexible pathways and sequences of multiple modules for professional development providers and teacher educators to use in their own contexts. Moreover, the project includes a plan to make the modules available through open access for professional developers and educators. The project contains a robust plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the professional development. In Year 3, a randomized controlled trial pilot efficacy study is planned to address the impact of teachers' participation in the group-paced delivery and facilitated course form format on their mathematics knowledge for teaching and teaching practice as well as the overall impact on their students' performance.

Team members will design, implement, and research the effects of a professional development immersion experience in mathematics for practicing secondary teachers (grades 7-12). The project will provide mathematics immersion experience to over 300 teachers at 56 sites across the country. Over the course of two years, each of 14 instructors will work with four geographically separated groups of 4-7 teachers, engaging them in mathematics as learners and facilitating conversations that connect the experience to their teaching and professional work. The project will provide the field a concrete model for modern practice-based mathematics immersion, conducted at scale. The model has the potential to broaden participation in immersive professional development experiences, offering opportunities to greater numbers of teachers and expanding the diversity of school contexts affected.

The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. The investigator will develop a Cognitive Diagnostic Computerized Adaptive Testing (CD-CAT) system to support the learning of introductory statistics at the university level. The work represents a significant advance in educational testing to provide personalized assessments which in turn generate diagnostic information based on students' proficiency profiles, as opposed to an abstract overall test score. <br/><br/>The research deals specifically with difficulties such as the requirement of large samples, underdevelopment in identification of the underlying model, and possible technical complexity limiting the availability of the model-based CD-CAT to educational practitioners; especially teachers and their students in smaller instructional settings. In light of these considerations, the project first proposes an innovative general nonparametric classification (GNPC) alternative, which is a general version of the nonparametric classification (NPC) method. The GNPC method can be used to analyze not only large- but also small-scale data, such as course-based data, conforming to a broad range of cognitive diagnostic models, an advantage that makes cognitive diagnosis analysis accessible to those who are in its highest need. The development of this ready-to-use heuristic method then moves the field further toward the routine use of the nonparametric CD-CAT within educational micro-environments. The proposed algorithms will be applied to online statistics courses, where high-performance formative assessments are employed to provide useful and timely feedback on how well students perform. The proposed line of inquiry integrates research and education through the development of an online CD-CAT system to support the learning of statistics.

Ten school districts in rural Iowa will be chosen for this study. It is anticipated that new knowledge on rural informal education will be generated to benefit the Nation's workforce. The specific objectives are to understand how informal STEM learning shapes the academic and psychosocial outcomes of rural, high-potential students, and to identify key characteristics of successful informal STEM learning environments for rural, high-potential students and their teachers. The results of this project will provide new tools for educators to increase the flow of underserved students into STEM from economically-disadvantaged rural settings. <br/><br/>The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology predicts a rapid rise in the number of STEM jobs available in the next decade, describing an urgent need for students' educational opportunities to prepare them for this workforce. In 2014, 62% of CEOs of major US corporations reported challenges filling positions requiring advanced computer and information technology knowledge. The project team will use a mixed methods approach, integrating comparative case study and mixed effects longitudinal methods, to study the Excellence program. Data sources include teacher interviews, classroom observations, and student assessments of academic aptitude and psychosocial outcomes. The analysis and evaluation of the program will be grounded in understanding the local efforts of school districts to build curriculum responsive to the demands of their high-potential student body. The project design, and subsequent analysis plan, utilizes a mixed methods approach, incorporating case study and longitudinal quantitative methods to analyze naturalistic data and build robust evidence for the implementation and impact of this program.

The goal is to investigate whether similarities and differences in brain activity between teachers and students predict STEM engagement and learning outcomes. The proposed research will contribute to educational practice in a number of ways. For example, the extent to which brainwaves exhibit similar patterns across students can be used as an online, implicit measure of student engagement with STEM content. As such, brainwave synchrony can prove useful in the future as an objective measure of the effectiveness of teaching practices, providing insight into the learning process in real time. In addition, as part of the proposed research, an EEG-based neuroscience curriculum for high schools will be developed and tested.

The project extends previous NSF-funded work that enabled the development of the experimental setup and analytical tools required to simultaneously record brain activity from a teacher and a group of students. The project will advance our understanding of naturalistic classroom interaction by: (a) using state-of-the-art wireless EEG headsets that are expected to provide much more accurate and richer neurophysiological data than the low-grade portable EEG headsets from prior research; (b) recording brain activity not only from students, but also from teachers; (c) collecting data from a sample of students and teachers in different schools and school types; (d) investigating the relationship between brain-to-brain synchrony across students and teachers, learning outcomes, and objective measures of attention; and (e) exploring brain-to-brain synchrony in the context of an unresolved issue in the STEM learning literature, the effectiveness of virtual laboratory environments. This project will take neuroscience research outside of the laboratory and into the classroom, taking an important step in integrating neuroscience research and education practices.

The Computer Science for All: Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) program is supporting this project, with an RPP team comprised of teachers, principals, researchers, professional development leaders, curriculum developers, and software engineers stretched across several institutions in Los Angeles, including three elementary public and charter schools, the University of California, Los Angeles, and a non-profit community learning center that develops CS curriculum and software. This project focuses on how to effectively teach problem solving practices in 3rd - 4th grade computer science classes, namely on how to build students' capacities to articulate their problem-solving process, understand how different strategies advance problem solving, and develop and enact new strategies for problem solving. The RPP will seed this problem solving process with 3rd and 4th graders traditionally marginalized in urban environments by designing CS lessons that promote sustained, rigorous, and collaborative reflection on problem-solving processes. This work will generate lesson templates and research findings valuable to educators interested in the intersection of problem solving and computer programming, and set the stage for larger scale research-practice partnership initiatives.<br/><br/>The RPP's approach will address a critical research need to understand how young students think about and pursue problem solving with code in the context of whole- and small-group classroom discourse, focused around facets of problem solving synthesized from the wider research literature: problem exploration, goal setting, implementation, monitoring, and reflection. The project team of curriculum designers, researchers, and practitioners will be informed by multiple data sources: observations of classroom practice, teacher interviews, designer interviews, school leader interviews, and bi-monthly student surveys. They will use a blend of design methodologies, agile development and design-research conjecture mapping, to iteratively and pragmatically aim to foster rich classroom discourse on CS problem solving processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to expand the implementation of a NSBE-supported program, ""Summer Engineering Experiences for Kids"", from 14 sites in 2016, to 31 by 2019; from 3,825 3rd-5th grade African American, Hispanic, and female students in 2015, to cumulatively 27,000 across the nation over the three-year duration of the project. By 2019, a total of 42,000 students will have been impacted by the program since its inception in 2007. The project will advance efforts of the ITEST program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging them in a summer program through hands-on, team-based engineering design projects led by collegiate mentor-teachers. The project will use ""A World in Motion""--an engineering curriculum for elementary and middle school children developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers, in addition to other STEM curricula to be incorporated across sites. Participants will experience applied engineering and computer programming learning opportunities, including engineering principles and related mathematics and science concepts and practices through selected activities. While expanding the program, researchers in the partnership will investigate the contextual factors that facilitate or constrain its implementation in order to develop a prototype with a potential to be used in various learning environments. Thus, the overall hypothesis of the work will be that organizational contexts enable, inhibit, and shape the experiences that students have, and consequently influence their outcomes. <br/><br/>The three research questions will be: (1) For each site and across all sites, what is the change in students' STEM-related academic and career identity, conceptual knowledge, and interpersonal and intrapersonal skills?; (2) What is the relationship between students' academic motivation (i.e., empowerment, usefulness, success, interest, caring) and their STEM-related academic and career identity, conceptual knowledge, and interpersonal and intrapersonal skills?; and (3) How do organizational context factors influence students' experiences and outcomes? To address the first question, outcome measures will be administered in a pretest-posttest format to identify changes in students' STEM-related outcomes over the course of the program. To address the second research question, the project will use multilevel modeling to incorporate site-specific contextual variables. To address the third research question, the project will employ a multi-case study approach to investigate variation in available resources and implementation strategies across sites each year. Through multiple data collection methods, the research will capture the influential contextual factors of different sites and their relationship with students' experiences and outcomes. An advisory panel comprising scholars and practitioners in engineering education, engineering outreach programs, and research will provide oversight of the project's progress and an independent mechanism for evaluation. An external evaluator will conduct both formative and summative aspects of the project. The key outcome of the effort will be a research-informed and field-tested model to increase African American, Hispanic, and female students' achievement and engagement in STEM disciplines."

Roughly one million refugees resettled in the United States in the past decade, many of whom are school-aged youth. During secondary school, resettled refugee youth are often still developing English language literacy and STEM skills needed for successful postsecondary experiences in the United States. At the same time, these youth bring rich cultural and linguistic resources that they can use as an asset as they grow their STEM skill sets, prepare for future success, and make positive impacts on U.S. society. To promote these assets and engage youth in developing STEM literacy, this after-school program engages these youth in critical STEM literacy development.  The project focuses on STEM learning, specifically the relationship between human life and climate, as well as developing youths' STEM identities and agency. <br/><br/>The project will develop and implement a community-based afterschool program that provides resettled Burmese refugee youth with STEM learning experiences. By drawing upon youths' experiences, the program will engage youth in learning about climate science and developing digital stories to communicate with broader audiences. To do so, the team will implement a program that builds on principles of responsive teaching, funds of knowledge, and English literacy development in authentic meaning-making contexts. The project will examine how youth expand their STEM knowledge, develop STEM identities and agency, and develop their expertise in communicating about STEM within and beyond their participation in the after-school program. The research team will explore existing and innovative data collection and analysis methods by drawing on principles of ethnography, video ethnography, mediated discourse analysis, and phenomenological and ethnomethodological analysis of interviews. These analyses will document learning over time in informal STEM learning settings. As there is very little prior research on STEM learning in this population, this project will generate knowledge about how to support STEM sense-making and critical STEM literacy. Furthermore, by testing the designed curriculum and building a partnership with a local community organization, the project will build capacity for broadening participation in informal STEM learning practices."

From the animations programmed in their video games to algorithms used to determine the next song selection from their playlists, today's youth are inundated with simple and complex computational models, tools, and practices. Nationally, computing and computational thinking practices are transforming STEM education and youth workforce preparedness. In fact, computational thinking practices are now recognized, alongside mathematics, as a fundamental core scientific practice in the Next Generation Science Standards. Consequently, much attention has been paid in recent years towards increasing opportunities for youth to engage in STEM content through computing and computational thinking practices. Access to these learning opportunities in computing, however, is inequitable. Youth of color are especially vulnerable to these inequities, as computational thinking practices are often devoid of the cultural capital and community engagement that research has shown to be particularly effective in attracting and engaging youth from underrepresented groups in STEM. This three-year research and design project will examine the intersectionality between computational thinking practices, interdisciplinary STEM learning, and culturally expressive practices on youths' learning and identity development. The model will test the feasibility of culturally sustaining learning environments and the foundational principles of hip hop as a model to engage and encourage middle school youth from predominately underrepresented groups to learn, connect to, and consider computing in their everyday lives. <br/><br/>Over a three-year period, an estimated 400 middle school aged youth will participate in the project and research. The youth will meet online and afterschool at community-based sites (i.e., makerspace, arts-based space, community center) in Gary, Indiana; Philadelphia, PA; and Cambridge, MA. A range of interdisciplinary STEM topics will be covered including science principles (e.g., physics), mathematics, engineering, computer programming, digital media, and cross-platform product planning and development through the lens of computational thinking or making practices. The youth will work collaboratively to develop and design their own interdisciplinary STEM-based computing projects, using hip hop as a basis. The online platform, cyber cypher, will be piloted by Youmedia Network Labs, a nationwide network of 28 makerspaces and the Cambridge Agenda for Children-Middle School Network, a network of afterschool programs in Cambridge, MA.  With regards to the research, several salient questions will be explored: (1) How do middle school youth appropriate, resist, and/or transform ecologically situated resources and practices as they learn computational making practices? (2) How do variations in different culturally sustaining spaces affect the development of learning in interdisciplinary computational making practices? (3) How do middle school youth appropriate, resist, and/or transform ecologically situated resources as they construct pluralistic computational making identities and within different learning environments? and (4) Across the three sites, what are the design principles of the culturally sustaining computational making environments that contribute to computational making practices and STEM learning and identity development? Data will be collected from surveys, field observations, computational making & design skills assessments, and multimodal design narratives. The results of the research and an external evaluation will be analyzed and disseminated via academic and practitioner targeted journals, conferences, project participant community events, online communities, and social media. <br/><br/>This project is funded by STEM + C which supports research and the development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project supports the expansion of an interactive, online STEM Videohall where hundreds of NSF-funded researchers share their work through brief video narratives and interactive discussion. While the Videohall is accessible year-round, periodic annual Showcase events are used to drive visitors to the site where they can engage with one another, the project investigators and trained facilitators. The Videohall is a multiplier of NSF's investments in individual projects because it allows STEM education researchers to become aware of, and learn from, related work that is funded across NSF programs and directorates, and other federal agencies. In 3-minute video narratives, investigators share ideas, resources, data, evidence of impact, strategies and challenges. The Videohall platform supports open access and is designed to foster communication in ways that scale beyond traditional formats such as academic conferences. Moreover, because the online STEM Videohall is open to the public, it allows STEM investigators to share their work with multiple stakeholder communities including K-12 educators and school leaders, informal educators and community organizations, the STEM industry, education policy makers and families. Finally, because each video narrative is accompanied by a facilitated online discussion thread, investigators have a unique and valuable mechanism for receiving feedback from these various stakeholder communities. The STEM Videohall project is funded by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>This project brings together seven NSF-funded resource centers who work with their respective communities to encourage Principal Investigators to share video narratives of their work through annual NSF STEM Showcase events. Each annual Showcase event presents videos created by 150-230 projects; many of the projects are affiliated with one of the seven resource centers, but others are from projects across NSF directorates and beyond. During a one-week period, Principal Investigators, their project staff, as well as the public at large, are invited to engage in interactive discourse, providing queries, comments, and feedback. Participants also vote for favorite presentations through ""Presenters' Choice,"" ""Public Choice,"" and ""Facilitators' Choice,"" processes. This participant voting system serves to increase engagement and enhances outreach of the event through social media. After the one-week Showcase event concludes, all of the videos along with the related discourse remain available to the public online, who continue to access the Showcase throughout the year. Based on prior pilot work, it is estimated that over the course of a year, over 30,000 visitors, from over 150 countries, will engage with each annual Showcase. Videos from annual showcase events will be shared, reused, and repurposed to create new products with new constituencies. The project includes technical development efforts to iteratively improve its interactive platform, outreach efforts before each annual Showcase event, facilitation of the week-long event, and intensive dissemination efforts.  A research component examines the extent of participation on various constituencies, the benefit of participation to projects, and the success of the events in terms of dissemination nationally and internationally."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Many U.S. students enter college without the necessary background in algebra to be successful in advanced mathematics and science courses, and are thereby blocked from many rewarding careers. Oftentimes, the problem goes back to early algebra in grades 4-6, where students are introduced to abstract formulations before they understand the underlying ideas and the reasons for the questions being asked. As a result of inadequate preparation many students turn away from mathematics when faced with abstract algebra. Without mathematics, students are not able to enter the STEM field which results in a weakened workforce in these fields in the United States. In this 4-year Full Research and Development project, Math Snacks Early Algebra: Using Games and Inquiry to Help Students Transition from Number to Variable, the interdisciplinary research group from New Mexico State University will build on their success in using games to increase students' understanding of proportional reasoning and fractions. They will develop games to build conceptual understanding of key early algebra topics.  The materials will be freely accessible on the web in both English and Spanish. The project will develop 4-5 games. Each game will include supporting materials for use by students in inquiry-based classroom lessons, and web-based professional development tools for teachers. <br/><br/>Most students do not understand the variety of distinct ways that variables are used in mathematics: unknowns to be solved for, related quantities, general properties of numbers, and other uses.  Algebra courses often emphasize the rules of manipulation, with less time spent on the underlying ideas. Students see variables as confusing new material, rather than as shortcuts for making sense of numbers, or as powerful tools for analyzing interesting problems.  This hinders students' later interest and progress in STEM courses and careers.The intellectual merit for this R & D project includes the development of a new way to learn key underlying concepts in algebra, further investigation of the affordances of games and technology in learning abstract mathematical concepts, and a better understanding of learning assessment in early algebra. The broader impact for this R & D project includes making these tools widely available to students, and the potential shift of teachers towards effective mathematical pedagogy that is engaging and inquiry-based. Development will begin with existing research on early algebraic thinking and learning, and proceed through an iterative process involving design, testing in the NMSU Learning Games Lab, testing in classrooms, and back to design. The project will then study the effect of the developed materials on student understanding and on classroom learning environments. Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used. Researchers will use a custom measure aligned with NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) and other standard tests, interviews and observations with teachers and students, and embedded data collection and self-reports on frequency and extent of game usage.  After two earlier pilot studies, in the final year a delayed intervention study will be conducted with 50 teachers and their students. The Math Snacks team has existing partnerships for distribution of games and materials with PBS, GlassLabs, BrainPOP, and others. Academic findings of the project will be shared through conferences and research publications."

The focus of the partnership is to recruit annually a cohort of thirty ethnically and racially diverse high school students from the partnering school districts for immersion in a STEM intensive PBL four-week ""STEM Summer Academy"" hosted by Tuskegee University. The Academy is designed to provide 30 rising 10th and 11th grade students annually (90 over the life of the three-year grant) with far-reaching technological experiences through the exciting exploration of aerial drones under a PBL framework. Students in each cohort will form a diverse group in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and residing in urban or rural areas. The key questions being addressed are: (1) What coherent sets of experiences effectively and efficiently support student competency (e.g., knowledge, skills), motivation and persistence for productive participation in the STEM-related workforce of today or in the future? (2) What roles might business and industry workforce members play in motivating students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for careers in the STEM-related workforce? and (3) Given the shifting demographics reflected in our current classrooms and in our country what are effective and productive ways to ensure broadening participation by engaging diverse underrepresented populations in STEM programs and careers?<br/><br/>The goals of this project have been developed in collaboration with officials from the partner school districts, faculty at Tuskegee University and Auburn University and representatives from the Alabama State Department of Education.

Computational thinking is the set of ideas and practices considered vital for computer science skills and has been attracting increased attention over the past several years in K-12 education. This project leverages an existing game by embedding tools for studying patterns of students' decision-making and problem solving in the environment. This allows researchers to understand how students learn about computational thinking within a tool that bridges informal and formal learning settings to engage a wide variety of students. The project will also develop tools and resources for classroom teachers. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The research examines three questions. First, what strategies do players develop during Zoombinis gameplay that may provide evidence of implicit computational thinking? Second, how can teachers leverage implicit knowledge of computational thinking developed in Zoombinis to improve formal (explicit) learning? Third, how can a large-scale commercial game be used for broad and equitable improvement of computational thinking? The research uses and develops educational data mining techniques to assess students' learning in conjunction with pre-post computational thinking assessments (external to the game), teacher interviews, classroom observations, and case studies of classroom use. The goal is to understand both students' learning of computational thinking and how to bridge the formal and informal learning via classroom implementation of the Zoombinis game."

The Developing High-Tech, Low-Cost Making Projects to Enhance Computational Teaching and Learning (ECTL) will design a new genre of low-cost, high-tech maker projects to help students work across physical and digital designs to expand their computational thinking practices into new directions. The project objectives are to: 1) build knowledge and pedagogical practices that create new entry points for young people to explore digital computation; 2) develop culturally relevant digital making projects that advance equity-oriented Science. Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and computational practices for youth and communities whose member are underrepresented in STEM; and 3) identify future areas of research and development that will expand civic, cultural, and scientific participation. Rather than giving educators the digital designs of computer scientists and asking them to implement new projects in afterschool settings, ECTL will design digital making projects that recognize community expertise. This expertise combined with that of artists, computer scientists, and learning scientists will allow the project team to develop new high-tech/low-cost projects to advance the computational thinking practices of young people in working-class communities of color. This project builds on the computational practices rooted in histories of making activities within marginalized communities and will introduce new digital computing practices into their existing material-rich making programs. Guided by project research, ECTL will design activities using low-cost, high-tech tools like craft cutters and e-textiles in combination with familiar objects, tools, and activities that educators are already using in their maker programs. The project will use a low cost/high tech approach to explicitly connect students' cultural worlds to digital computational thinking practices that are not expensive, flashy, or laboratory-like. Project research findings and practical educational resources, such as activity/educator guides to low-cost/high-tech projects, will be widely shared with researchers and educators.<br/><br/>ECTL is designed to ensure that transformative learning in the digital maker movement is equitable and incorporates the ingenuity of working class communities of color in the design and expansion of computational thinking education initiatives.

Three research questions will guide the development process: 1) How do young people learn computational thinking practices through activities that connect to cultural practices and creative play with high-tech, low cost materials in three afterschool programs? 2) How do educators enhance young people's computational thinking practices using high tech low cost materials in existing afterschool settings? 3) How do artists, educators, computer scientists, and researchers work together to develop new projects that draw out young people's computational thinking and deepen practices over time? Each cycle of research and design will begin in the three afterschool settings where researchers will observe and collect video data of computational practices that educators are already supporting through the development maker projects in their afterschool settings. The next phase will be video analysis of these computational thinking practices emerging in each site. Teams of afterschool educators and their research partners will analyze and present examples, challenges, and creative breakthroughs they capture in their local site. The final phase of each cycle will culminate in workshops with research + practice partnerships, artists, and computer scientists to develop and prototype digital maker projects that build on existing practices with a focus sharper focus on culturally sustaining digital designs. ECTL will contribute to the literatures on distributed cognition and collaborative learning by focusing on the understudied ways in which cultural practices and identity development, how race, class, and gender identities can be can be leveraged as resources, The project will add to the limited but growing research on in the design and implementation of high-tech low-cost maker projects."

From the animations programmed in their video games to algorithms used to determine the next song selection from their playlists, today's youth are inundated with simple and complex computational models, tools, and practices. Nationally, computing and computational thinking practices are transforming STEM education and youth workforce preparedness. In fact, computational thinking practices are now recognized, alongside mathematics, as a fundamental core scientific practice in the Next Generation Science Standards. Consequently, much attention has been paid in recent years towards increasing opportunities for youth to engage in STEM content through computing and computational thinking practices. Access to these learning opportunities in computing, however, is inequitable. Youth of color are especially vulnerable to these inequities, as computational thinking practices are often devoid of the cultural capital and community engagement that research has shown to be particularly effective in attracting and engaging youth from underrepresented groups in STEM. This three-year research and design project will examine the intersectionality between computational thinking practices, interdisciplinary STEM learning, and culturally expressive practices on youths' learning and identity development. The model will test the feasibility of culturally sustaining learning environments and the foundational principles of hip hop as a model to engage and encourage middle school youth from predominately underrepresented groups to learn, connect to, and consider computing in their everyday lives. <br/><br/>Over a three-year period, an estimated 400 middle school aged youth will participate in the project and research. The youth will meet online and afterschool at community-based sites (i.e., makerspace, arts-based space, community center) in Gary, Indiana; Philadelphia, PA; and Cambridge, MA. A range of interdisciplinary STEM topics will be covered including science principles (e.g., physics), mathematics, engineering, computer programming, digital media, and cross-platform product planning and development through the lens of computational thinking or making practices. The youth will work collaboratively to develop and design their own interdisciplinary STEM-based computing projects, using hip hop as a basis. The online platform, cyber cypher, will be piloted by Youmedia Network Labs, a nationwide network of 28 makerspaces and the Cambridge Agenda for Children-Middle School Network, a network of afterschool programs in Cambridge, MA.  With regards to the research, several salient questions will be explored: (1) How do middle school youth appropriate, resist, and/or transform ecologically situated resources and practices as they learn computational making practices? (2) How do variations in different culturally sustaining spaces affect the development of learning in interdisciplinary computational making practices? (3) How do middle school youth appropriate, resist, and/or transform ecologically situated resources as they construct pluralistic computational making identities and within different learning environments? and (4) Across the three sites, what are the design principles of the culturally sustaining computational making environments that contribute to computational making practices and STEM learning and identity development? Data will be collected from surveys, field observations, computational making & design skills assessments, and multimodal design narratives. The results of the research and an external evaluation will be analyzed and disseminated via academic and practitioner targeted journals, conferences, project participant community events, online communities, and social media. <br/><br/>This project is funded by STEM + C which supports research and the development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An emerging trend, nature-based playscapes have great potential for exposing young children to STEM-related phenomena, concepts, and processes in a variety of early childhood education settings, including daycare centers, pre-schools, playgrounds, and children's museums. In contrast to traditional playgrounds, playscapes are designed to result in complex, sensory-rich environments in which extensive access to natural materials and resources inspires young children's investigative and exploratory behaviors. This study explores the hypothesis that play in nature provides young children (ages 3-5) with extensive contact with science content and that a play-based curriculum could expand opportunities for STEM learning.<br/><br/>This Research-in-Service of Practice project will: 1) design, implement, and evaluate four digital play-based professional development curriculum modules for pre-school educators across multiple partner sites; 2) research the impact of professional training on educators' facilitation of STEM content and activities; 3) examine the impacts of play-based facilitation on young children's understanding of and engagement with STEM; and 4) evaluate the transferability and sustainability of new playscape design principles at three partner sites. This investigation will be led by researchers at the University of Cincinnati in close collaboration with early childhood educators at the Arlitt Center, Cincinnati Nature Center, and two local early childhood organizations that serve children in Head Start programs. The study will use a mixed-methods approach. Data sources include video observations, behavior mapping, teacher self-studies, surveys, interviews, child assessments and children's photo documentation of their experiences.<br/><br/>This research project is being funded by the AISL program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The research supported by the award is collaborative with research at DePaul University. The researchers are studying the use of technologies to enable communities to connect youth and youth organizations to effectively support diverse learning pathways for all students. These communities, the youth, the youth organizations, formal and informal education organizations, and civic organizations form a learning ecology. The DePaul University researchers will design and implement a smart community infrastructure in the City of Chicago to track real-time student participation in community STEM activities and to develop mobile applications for both students and adults. The smart community infrastructure will bring together information from a variety of sources that affect students' participation in community activities. These include geographic information (e.g., where the student lives, where the activities take place, the student transportation options, the school the student attends), student related information (e.g., the education and experience background of the student, the economic status of the student, students' schedules), and activity information (e.g., location of activity, requirements for participation).  The University of Colorado researchers will take the lead on analyzing these data in terms of a community learning ecologies framework and will explore computational approaches (i.e., recommender systems, visualizations of learning opportunities) to improve youth exploration and uptake of interests and programs. These smart technologies are then used to reduce the friction in the learning connection infrastructure (called L3 for informal, formal, and virtual learning) to enable the student to access opportunities for participation in STEM activities that are most feasible and most appropriate for the student. Such a flexible computational approach is needed to support the necessary diversity of potential recommendations: new interests for youth to explore; specific programs based on interests, friends' activities, or geographic accessibility; or programs needed to ""level-up"" (develop deeper skills) and complete skills to enhance youths' learning portfolios. Although this information was always available, it was never integrated so it could be used to serve the community of both learners and the providers and to provide measurable student learning and participation outcomes.<br/><br/>The learning ecologies theoretical framework and supporting computational methods are a contribution to the state of the art in studying afterschool learning opportunities. While the concept of learning ecologies is not new, to date, no one has offered such a systematic and theoretically-grounded portfolio of measures for characterizing the health and resilience of STEM learning ecologies at multiple scales. The theoretical frameworks and concepts draw together multiple research and application domains: computer science, sociology of education, complexity science, and urban planning. The L3 Connects infrastructure itself represents an unprecedented opportunities for conducting ""living lab"" experiments to improve stakeholder experience of linking providers to a single network and linking youth to more expanded and varied opportunities. The University of Colorado team will employ three methods: mapping, modeling, and linking youth to STEM learning opportunities in school and out of school settings in a large urban city (Chicago). The recommender system will be embedded into youth and parent facing mobile apps, enabling the team to characterize the degree to which content-based, collaborative filtering, or constraint based recommendations influence youth actions. The project will result in two measurable outcomes of importance to key L3 stakeholder groups: a 10% increase in the number of providers (programs that are part of the infrastructure) in target neighborhoods and a 20% increase in the number of youth participating in programs."

This project is focused on a collaborative design, implementation, and study of recurrent engineering-focused interventions with middle school youth in three rural and Appalachian communities. The intervention efforts will broaden middle schoolers' participation and understanding of what engineering is, what engineers do, and help dispel the notion that it is hard and requires a love of mathematics and science. The project has the potential for recruiting future engineers who are unaware of their abilities and career possibilities because of the rural Appalachian communities in which they live. Broadening participation in engineering remains a critical national priority and this project has the potential to prevent the loss of smart capable students from engineering education and career pathways. The proposed partnership with school educators and industry experts will established an open-source engineering outreach curriculum (iFixit) and facilitate regular in-class interventions throughout the academic year. <br/><br/>The study design enables the examination of the participants and interventions across time and case-site contexts, where the data are collected at individual-level to look for changes over time while within-case and cross-case examination of the community-level impacts will be analyzed. The objective will be to achieve meaningful results of the two goals: Goal 1- to increase youth awareness of, interest in, and readiness for diverse engineering related careers and educational pathways which is a goal that hinges on a collaboratively designed and facilitated set of monthly interventions in a curricular setting and Goal 2- to build capacity for schools to sustainably integrate engineering skills and knowledge of diverse engineering-related careers and educational pathways aimed at both the individual-level with a focus on teachers as influential change makers as well as at the community-level focused on sustainable cross-sector collaborations. The project will offer in-school curriculum activities (interventions) six times per academic year in three similar rural communities in Virginia: 1) Bedford County Public Schools 2) Giles County Public Schools, and 3) Smyth County Public Schools. All case sites are located in rural areas or near Appalachia where there is limited industry, particularly advanced industry exposes students, parents, and educators to engineering careers. Leveraging local expertise is especially critical in this project because family pressures, cultural milieu, and preference for local, stable jobs play considerable roles in how Appalachian youth choose possible careers."

Research shows that world-wide, despite its importance to the life sciences, natural selection remains one of the most widely misunderstood processes in biology. Specifically, studies reveal that scientific misconceptions about natural selection not only persist among high school students and undergraduates who are usual targets of instruction on evolution by natural selection, but, disturbingly, also among many of the teachers trained to teach them. Research further reveals that the origin of many of these misconceptions can be traced to intuitive cognitive biases found at the elementary school level. This project will address this problem by building and testing a learning sequence on natural selection at the early elementary grades before intuitive theoretical misconceptions are likely to have become entrenched. This effort will expand existing infrastructure for research and education currently supported through a university, to school partnership involving elementary educators, curriculum developers, professional development providers, interdisciplinary academic researchers and cognitive development expert consultants.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on understanding whether the proposed natural selection learning sequence is even viable and beneficial for elementary school students and teachers given children's representational constraints, the development and entrenchment of intuitive cognitive biases and teacher science anxiety. The two central aims will be to: (1) develop the core architecture and explore the feasibility of an expanded elementary school learning sequence on natural selection; (2) examine the educative professional development benefits to elementary school teachers of the developed story-based intervention materials. Six interventions will be conducted through an iteratively designed series of laboratory, afterschool, or classroom empirical studies to explore the viability of mechanistically teaching K-2 children about within- and between-species adaptation by natural selection. Due to the non-binary nature of data that will be generated by the studies, core analyses will be repeated measures ordinal logistic regressions with chi-squared tests for significance. Effect sizes will be indexed by odds ratio. Results from this work will advance scientific knowledge and educational practice by yielding insights about children?s capacities as explanatory thinkers and theory-builders. Materials and products (storybooks, animations and assessment tools) will directly benefit schools, teachers, children and parents in the State of Massachusetts and nationally."

This project will advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying the cognitive basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning, as well as the Cyberlearning program in discovering how to design and effectively use learning technologies of the future.  <br/><br/>The approach used for knowledge diagnosis in the online tutor will be Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning. This approach combines ideas from machine learning and cognitive science. Students' responses will be modeled using Markov decision processes, a decision-theoretic formalism that indicates how a rational agent should take a series of actions to achieve a goal. This will make it possible to calculate the probability that a student would take a particular series of actions, given his or her knowledge of the domain. Bayesian inference will be used to invert this model, providing a probability distribution over the knowledge state of the student given his or her actions. Applying this approach to algebra problem solving will make it possible to identify students' misconceptions from freeform solutions to algebra problems. The proposed research will require addressing challenges such as working with the infinite, structured state spaces that are needed to describe algebraic equations, accommodating composite actions (such as skipping a step in a derivation), modeling learning, and optimizing the design of assessments."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This proposal seeks to design a next generation diagnostic assessment using learning progressions and other research (in the learning sciences) to support middle grades mathematics teaching and learning.  It will focus on nine large content ideas, and associated Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.  The PIs will track students over time, and work within school districts to ensure feasibility and use of the assessment system. <br/> <br/>The research will build on prior funding by multiple funding agencies and address four major goals. The partnership seeks to address these goals: 1) revising and strengthening the diagnostic assessments in mathematics by adding new item types and dynamic tools for data gathering 2) studying alternative ways to use measurement models to assess student mathematical progress over time using the concept of learning trajectories, 3) investigating how to assist students and teachers to effectively interpret reports on math progress, both at the individual and the class level, and 4) engineering and studying instructional strategies based on student results and interpretations, as they are implemented within competency-based and personalized learning classrooms. The learning map, assessment system, and analytics are open source and can be used by other research and implementation teams. The project will exhibit broad impact due to the number of states, school districts and varied kinds of schools seeking this kind of resource as a means to improve instruction.  Finally, the research project contributes to the nationally supported move to create, use, and apply research based open educational resources at scale."

This project will conduct an early stage exploratory study of an untested idea that will address the nation's STEM workforce needs. It will use a radically different approach to uncover barriers that impede broader participation by specific race-gender groups in STEM fields. The study will investigate whether school policies and practices regarding safety, discipline, school crime, suspensions and other such related factors, within charter and traditional public schools, contribute to the loss of large numbers of underrepresented students from the STEM pipeline. This is especially important since decades of efforts have not resulted in a stronger and more diverse 21st Century STEM workforce. To help address this condition, this study will examine the interplay of three main areas often cited as reasons the nation's human resource needs remain unmet. The study will focus on the impact of policies and practices on the STEM outcomes of race-gender groups. It will also look at how these schools differ in their mediation of the relationship of these regulations with STEM outcomes. Finally, the study will examine the impact school location and student residency have on strategies employed. There are currently no studies that have explored this approach. This study will attempt to lead the field in that regard.<br/><br/>Through an interdisciplinary approach, student data from the National Center for Education Statistics will be merged and analyzed. With no prior efforts to guide these mergers, this novel approach is risky since it remains unknown if any viable solutions will emerge to address barriers to meeting future STEM workforce needs. Yet, the potential payoff will be significant if results show that such work is not only feasible, but capable of contributing to foundational knowledge that links school policies and practices to broadening participation in STEM. The main outcome of this work will be a longitudinal dataset of 9th graders and will contain measures of their exposure to specific barriers, type of charter or traditional public school previously attended, and residential locations. The dataset will also relate specific contextual factors to outcomes in algebra and science concepts, math and science identity, and STEM degree aspirations. Thus, the study will advance knowledge about theories of social control and intersectionality. The policy relevance of this research will also be significant and may generate knowledge about the human capital cost of policies and practices; and potentially transformative alternatives that, if adopted, could redirect students' pathways into STEM fields instead of out of the pipeline. Further, outcomes from the study will also be available for widespread use by STEM educators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students and researchers at other institutions who may generate future research beneficial to society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While learning progressions have shown promise as supports for teachers as they design formative assessments, as well as suggested new approaches for modeling student learning, the field is still only at the beginning stages of understanding how learning progressions can inform and enhance student learning. This research is needed because studies show that although formative assessment may support student learning, formative assessment practices are not easy for teachers to learn. Through this effort up to 72 high school biology, chemistry and physics teachers will participate in professional learning communities to help them become more effective in using learning progression-centered formative assessment in their classrooms. This project will build on prior studies by helping teachers in setting learning goals, measuring student progress toward those goals, and providing feedback to improve students' performance. It will also extend an ongoing research-practice partnership between a university-based educational research team and a school district that are both committed to improving science education for its population of socioeconomically, linguistically, and ethnically diverse students.<br/><br/>The overarching goals will be to investigate how teachers: (1) Engage with different types of learning progressions in different content domains to inform formative assessment design in professional learning communities; (2) Enact learning progression-based formative assessment tasks with students; (3) Measure the effect of learning progression-centered professional development on student learning, as well as the mediators of this effect; and will also (4) Model student learning and the extent to which assessment results support the hypotheses represented in learning progressions. The study will employ complementary qualitative and quantitative methods and follow a year of design-based implementation research with a quasi-experimental study of teachers participating in research-team facilitated professional learning communities focused on learning progressions. Evidence pertaining to teacher professional learning will be gathered through the triangulation of data from front-to-back analyses of teacher participation in professional learning communities, structured interviews, classroom observations, and analysis of formative assessment tasks. Student learning will be tracked through pre-post diagnostic assessments linked to learning progressions teachers use in their professional learning communities. Results from this work will advance knowledge about theory building through tools and resources along with evidence of their effectiveness, design criteria to guide formation of effective teacher collaboration around formative assessment design in professional learning communities, and model approaches for student performance relative to learning progressions.

OGAP brings together two powerful ideas in mathematics education - formative assessment and research based learning trajectories - to enhance teacher knowledge, instructional practices, and student learning. Building on a proven track record of success with this model, the current project will translate findings from research on student learning of early number, addition, and subtraction into tools and routines that teachers can use to formatively assess their students' understanding on a regular basis and develop targeted instructional responses. The project involves a development component focused on producing and field testing new resources (including frameworks, item banks, pre-assessments and professional development materials) and a research component designed to improve the implementation of these resources in school settings. The materials that are developed from this project will help teachers be able to more precisely assess student understanding in the major mathematical work of grades K-2 in order to better meet the needs of diverse learners. With the addition of these new early elementary materials, OGAP formative assessment resources will be available for use from kindergarten through grade 8. <br/><br/>Although much attention has been paid to the improvement of early literacy, building strong mathematical foundations and early computational fluency is equally critical for later success in school and preparation for STEM careers. This project will develop and field test tools, resources, and routines that teachers can employ to help young students develop deeper conceptual understandings and more powerful and efficient strategies in the early grades. The project emerged from the needs of school-based practitioners looking for instructional support in the primary grades and uses design-based research methodology. The new materials will be developed, tested, and revised through multiple iterations of implementation in schools. Research-based learning trajectories will be consolidated into simplified frameworks that illustrate the overall progression of major levels of student thinking in the domains of counting, addition, and subtraction. A bank of formative assessment items will be developed, field tested, and refined through a three-phase validation process. Professional development modules will be designed and field tested to support teacher knowledge and effective use of the formative assessment tools and routines.  Data collected on key activities in the formative assessment process (including teacher selection of items, analysis of student work, instructional implications, and enacted instructional response) will be used to continually inform development as well as illuminate the conditions under which formative assessment leads to productive changes in instruction and student learning in the classroom. The project will yield a set of field tested tools and resources ready for both broader dissemination and further research on the promise of the intervention, as well as an understanding of how to support effective implementation."

Many military veterans who seek to transition to higher education or workforce pathways find it challenging to translate the skills they acquired during service to civilian STEM settings and the modern day workforce. Yet many returning veterans have significant experience with STEM fields, including mapping and geospatial technologies, because of their unique functions and service assignments. Such geospatial skills are useful for location-aware industries, citizen science and public services. At the same time, military and veteran families have been largely overlooked as an important public audience for focused informal STEM learning. Informal learning events called ""mapathons"" which enlists participants to mapping exercises and create geospatial data on open platforms that address authentic needs in their communities and the broader society at large. When seeking to further their education upon returning from service, veterans' typical options have included some form of formal higher education.  Mapathons may be a feasible bridging activity that (a) recognizes veterans' unique, valuable, and in-demand STEM skills and (b) supports lifelong learning.<br/><br/>This pilot research seeks to understand how informal learning experiences such as mapathons are viable pathways for veterans to transition to the civilian workforce. The conceptual approach pays attention to the realities of the life course of military and veteran families, especially building upon theories of change related to transitions to include a spatial component. The foundation of the project's intellectual merit is its explicit inclusion and sensitivity to place, scale, and spatial behavior, building directly from findings of prior NSF-funded projects and the evidence base for informal learning pathways. The research will contribute to knowledge about workforce development by addressing the questions: (1) To what extent do veterans recognize that their extant skills acquired, in military settings, are translatable to civilian STEM settings?; (2) How can informal learning experiences help a diverse veteran population increase awareness of the translatability of geospatial workforce competencies, build confidence in technology skills, and motivate interest to pursue formal studies in STEM fields in general?; and (3) What pathways do which veterans favor when they could pursue formal STEM higher education learning among an array of choices online or at regional sites, and why? The study will engage 320 participants at 8 sites across Texas; employ in-depth surveys and interviews; and use spatial analysis to elicit insights about the research questions.<br/><br/>Military and veteran families include a significant number of people from group typically underrepresented in STEM fields. Supporting more veterans to transition successfully to higher education pathways or careers in STEM is a vital service to the nation. This study on informal to formal pathways for veterans will include an innovative understanding of the importance of place in meaning-making and in the reality of choices they consider during the transitions of their life course.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Growing evidence about the powerful effects of skillful teaching on students' learning creates a need to for professional development that impacts teachers' actual practice. Just as other professions (e.g., nursing, social work, law) have centered practitioners' learning in ""live"" practice with structures that support learning in context, the project will investigate whether and how this can be accomplished in teaching. The approach uses a ""live mathematics classroom"" as a common text for working on practice, where participants are not only watching and discussing but are engaged in developing and learning practice. The project also explores the following variations in practice-based professional development: (1) on-site and remote participation of teachers; and (2) the addition of supplementary practice-focused professional development. The project will generate new knowledge regarding ways in which elementary teachers of mathematics can be supported to learn effective teaching practice. <br/><br/>This project addresses a fundamental challenge for professional development, that is, how to support teachers to improve their practice. Teachers profit from well-designed opportunities to develop new visions for practice, learn more about students' thinking, or work on specific mathematical topics or tasks. Still, such opportunities are often insufficient to support teachers with the complexity of classroom teaching. These kinds of professional opportunities focus on critical resources for instruction but not on the details of teaching practice itself. This practice-centered professional development is situated within a summer mathematics program for fifth graders. The proposed research will explore the impact on teachers' practice, as well as on their knowledge and dispositions, from participating in these structured ways. Three studies will resolve the following three sets of questions: (1) What do teachers learn from structured participation in the class? Does their participation impact their own teaching practice, and if so, in what ways? (2) Does the setting of the peripheral participation matter? Does this form of participation impact their own teaching practice, and if so, in what ways? (3) Does the addition of professional development focused on a particular teaching practice impact teachers' own practice, and if so, in what ways? How does the addition of professional development focused on a specific instructional practice compare across the in-person and online forms of participation in terms of impact on teachers' own practice? The project will collect and analyze several types of data pre- and post-intervention, including measures of mathematical knowledge for teaching, measures of language for talking about the work of teaching and students, and skill with leading a mathematics discussion, and the mathematical quality of instruction. The project will generate new knowledge related to to organizing professional learning around supports that teachers need to learn practice as well as ways to study their learning of teaching practice."

The resources developed should impact mathematics instruction (especially for algebra courses) by creating a learning progression which captures the range of student performance and appropriately places them at distinct levels of performance. The important contribution of the work is the development of a learning progression and related assessment tasks that account for the experiences of students often under-served in mathematics. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The learning progression development will begin by comparing and integrating existing learning progressions and current research on function learning. This project will develop an assessment of student knowledge of function based on learning progressions via empirical recovery (looking for the reconstruction of theoretical levels of the learning theory). Empirical recovery is the process through which data will be collected that reconstruct the various levels, stages, or sequences of said learning progression. The development of tasks and task models will include testing computer-delivered, interactive tasks and rubrics that can be used for human and automated scoring (depending on the task). Item response theory methods will be used to evaluate the assessment tasks' incorporation of the learning progression."

This project will investigate how to help pre-service teachers use mathematics curriculum materials purposefully to plan and to teach. A focus of this work is curricular noticing or how teachers interpret and respond to curriculum resources. A component of helping pre-service teachers prepare for the classroom is helping them understand how to effectively and purposefully use the tools that have been provided to them. The study includes data collected from experienced teachers and pre-service teachers as well as the design of resources for mathematics teacher educators. A significant component is studying what teachers notice when reviewing curriculum and planning for teaching. This work has implications for the design of curriculum materials and for teacher education. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.<br/><br/>The study has five research and educational objectives related to curricular noticing. First, to understand how to define the curricular noticing practices of attending to, interpreting, and deciding to respond to curriculum materials so that they are useful to research and teaching. Second, to understand what kinds of experiences best reveal the curricular noticing practices. Third, to understand and document the curricular noticing practices of practicing teachers. Fourth, to understand and document the curricular noticing practices of prospective teachers during and beyond teacher preparation. Fifth, to develop a module to support prospective teachers learning of the curricular noticing practice. To accomplish these goals, the study will incorporate interviews with experienced teachers and prospective teachers and conduct classroom observations. Some interviews will include eye-tracking technology to interpret what teachers attend to when looking at materials for planning. For the prospective teachers, a longitudinal approach will be used to investigate their curricular noticing during their preparation program and into their first years of teaching. From an education standpoint, the project will also include the creation of resources for other mathematics teacher preparation programs and courses to use. The project also includes professional development in curriculum use for secondary mathematics teachers."

This study takes an innovative approach to documenting how teacher knowledge can be enhanced by incorporating a design experience into pre-service mathematics education. The study's participating prospective teachers will use digital and fabrication technologies (e.g., 3D printers and laser cutters) to design and use manipulatives for K-6 mathematics learning. The goals of the project include describing how this experience influences the prospective teachers' knowledge and identities while creating curriculum for teacher education. Also, because more schools and students have access to 3D fabrication capabilities, teacher education can utilize these capabilities to prepare teachers to take advantage of these resources. Prior research by the team demonstrated how the process of making a manipulative can support prospective teachers in learning about mathematics and how to teach elementary mathematics concepts. The project will generate resources for other elementary teacher education programs and research about how prospective elementary teachers learn mathematics for teaching.

First, what forms of knowledge are brought to bear as prospective elementary teachers make new manipulatives and write corresponding tasks to support the teaching and learning of mathematics? Second, how does prospective elementary teachers' knowledge for teaching mathematics develop as they make new manipulatives and write tasks to support the teaching and learning of mathematics? Third, as prospective elementary teachers make new manipulatives and write tasks to support the teaching and learning of mathematics, how do they see themselves in relation to the making, the mathematics, and the mathematics teaching? The project will employ a design-based research methodology with cycles of design, enactment, analysis and redesign to create curriculum modules for teacher education focused on making mathematics manipulatives.

The idea is that classroom instruction should build on students' current conceptions and experiences. The context for the study is grades 3-5 teachers in Aurora Public Schools. It focuses on students from urban, underserved and low-socioeconomic status populations who often fall behind in the elementary grades and are left underprepared for middle grades mathematics. It includes a summer workshop and academic year follow-up including teacher collaboration. The project provides tools for capitalizing on successful, school-based research for promoting teachers' buy-in, adoption, and sustaining of student-adaptive pedagogy. The project also includes measurement of student understanding of the concepts. An extensive plan to share tools and resources for teachers and instructional coaches (scalable to district/state levels) and of research instruments and findings, will promote sharing project outcomes with a wide community of stakeholders (teachers, administrators, researchers, parents, policy makers) responsible for students' growth. This is a Full Design & Development project within the DRK-12 Program's Learning Strand. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The project aims to implement and study a professional development intervention designed to shift upper-elementary teachers' mathematics teaching toward a constructivist approach, called student-adaptive pedagogy (AdPed), which adapts teaching goals and activities based on students' conceptions and experiences. The project focuses on multiplicative and fractional reasoning--critical for students' success in key areas of middle school mathematics (e.g., ratio, proportion, and function). The project seeks to design an instrument for measuring teachers' implementation of AdPed, a clinical interview rubric for students' multiplicative reasoning and then an analysis of teachers' content knowledge and the implementation of AdPed following the professional development. The research design is rooted in an innovative, cohesive framework that integrates four research-based components: (i) a model of mathematics learning and knowing, (ii) models of progressions in students' multiplicative and fractional reasoning, (iii) a model of teaching (AdPed) to promote such learning, and (iv) a mathematics teacher development continuum. Capitalizing on successful preliminary efforts in the Denver Metro area to refine a PD intervention and student-adaptive tools that challenge and transform current practices, the project will first validate and test instruments to measure (a) teacher growth toward adaptive pedagogy and (b) students' growth in multiplicative reasoning. Using these new instruments, along with available measures, the project will then promote school-wide teacher professional development (grades 3-5) in multiple schools in an urban district with large underserved student populations and study the professional development benefits for teacher practices and student outcomes. The mixed methods study includes classroom-based data (e.g., video analysis, lesson observations, teacher interviews) and measures of students' multiplicative reasoning specifically and mathematical understanding generally."

This challenge persists despite efforts to define the knowledge teachers should have and despite previous innovative efforts to create good measures. This project tackles the challenge by specifically aiming to measure the kinds of knowledge developed in professional development (PD) programs that has been shown to matter for teachers' classroom practices and their students' learning. The project aims to develop an assessment that identifies patterns in the teachers' learning in a way that helps drive subsequent professional development.  The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to pursue a potentially transformative approach to the assessment of teacher proportional knowledge by developing a measure that is well aligned with the content and skills taught in various PD programs. This instrument will be based on a new approach that builds on emerging psychometric models. Specifically, diagnostic classification models (DCMs) will be utilized to diagnose teachers' learning during a PD program as well as employed to identify the progression in teachers' learning.  Statistical topic models (STMs) will be used to look for patterns of understanding that emerge from open-ended responses and provide natural-language insight into teachers' reasoning. A final version of the assessment will be constructed for a national sample based on the results from the predictive validity stage, and this version will be tested with teachers who participate in various types of PD programs targeting proportional reasoning. This project has broad implications for the creation of assessments and for teacher education. It will provide insights about whether there is a clear learning progression for teachers. While much work has been done with students' learning progression, much less is known about how teachers learn. Another implication is that the STM approach allows machine scoring of natural language in a way that highlights strengths and weaknesses in reasoning rather than simply returning a score. For formative use, this is information that is more helpful as it highlights areas for further instruction. A third implication is that DCMs will allow to assess teacher knowledge at a finer-grained understanding than is typically available, thus allowing for careful refinement of PD as well as a tool for showing overall growth in PD.  A fourth implication is that a more systematic approach will be followed to capture the kinds of knowledge teachers need. Assessments developed using DCMs and STMs have the potential to serve as models for developing further instruments in other STEM content areas. Such assessments have the potential to not only help identify successful PD programs, but also to provide PD providers with rich data from which they can make instructional decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. Stereotype threat and feelings of not belonging are suggested as important contributors of the under-achievement and underrepresentation of women in STEM. Numerous past laboratory experiments have shown that math-talented peer female role models alleviate the negative effect of stereotype threat, which should then foster feelings of belongingness in STEM. The key mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of peer role models seems to be gender similarity. This research study will engage in an in-depth exploration of similarity in order to build understanding of the peer role model effect and identify ways to make peer role models optimally effective.<br/><br/>This project will provide a rich amount of lab-based and prospective, real-world data that will advance theory and knowledge on ways peer role models can inspire women to thrive and persist in STEM. Experiments will investigate the impact of increasing similarity between women and peer role models, examine whether substituting one source of similarity with another can turn male peers into role models, and attempt to identify the source or combination of sources of similarity that optimize the peer role model effect. The research will be conducted at San Diego State University (SDSU) and the knowledge gained from this research will then be used to inform a prospective field study conducted in San Diego high school math classrooms. High school is a time when mathematics-related gender differences begin to emerge and these gender differences seem to be strong predictors of women's choice to pursue and persist in STEM. This is also a time when peer influence is particularly strong. Hence, introducing peer role models into high school math classrooms would be a particularly beneficial method for reducing the gender gap in STEM."

It will also examine whether or not the intervention will transform students' beliefs and behaviors about science as they take part in problem-based learning activities and content-driven social interactions. The intervention will take place in an out-of-class context to help students develop self-worth and self-direction as part of building a broader STEM community of learners. Near-peer mentors of similar backgrounds as the students will be trained in both academic and social areas to ensure that students gain a deeper understanding of biology and see the relevance of this field to their lives and other STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/>The study will take a radically different approach to research by combining theories to examine multiple factors shown to synergistically influence motivation and improve learning for underrepresented students. Through a mixed methods approach, data will be collected and analyzed on both academic and personal factors. Despite these notable aspects of the project, this intervention will have risks. Specifically, it is a novel research topic, and the activities do not include direct day-to-day faculty supervision or regular graded classwork. Additionally, the project will require students to be self-motivated and self-directed to complete the tasks, and will neither guarantee that students will volunteer to participate nor resist social pressures that may prevent them from engaging in the study. Therefore, it is not clear if this study can be done or if it will alter students' academic knowledge and skills or beliefs and behaviors. However, the intervention is potentially transformative in shaping the development of effective models of intervention and reducing the number of underrepresented students who switch to different majors or drop out of STEM fields.

TEEP includes four graduate-level courses that help them learn engineering content and pedagogical approaches. There has been little investigation of teacher professional development in engineering design. The work that has been done focuses on increasing teachers' content knowledge and familiarity in engineering. Most teacher professional development and research focus on teachers learning engineering content and process, with less attention on helping teachers develop new instructional practices necessary to help students navigate the complex, ill-defined problems in engineering.  TEEP focuses on helping teachers develop practices of responsive teaching in engineering design, where teachers base their instructional moves on what they notice in their students are doing and saying. Project research will also contribute to literature on how to support responsive teaching in web-based environments, expanding understanding of how design principles and features developed in in-person professional development settings can be implemented online.  The project will refine a program for engineering teachers nationwide, identify key features that are effective in developing teachers' practice, and create video resources for other professional development programs to use. <br/><br/>The project will address three research questions: (1) What do beginning engineering teachers notice in students' engineering design work? (2) What shifts occur in teachers' noticing over the course of a professional development program focused on responsive teaching and how do these shifts correlate with key features of the program? (3) What shifts occur in how teachers' talk about their goals for students' engineering and their instructional practice? The project will conduct independent analyses from two cohorts of teachers of three data streams: pre-post interviews about practice; teacher-captured classroom videos; video-stimulated interviews, and teachers' coursework. The analyses will then connect these analyses to address the research questions. Videocases of students' engineering will be disseminated for other teacher educators to use in supporting teacher noticing. The research outcomes of the research will not only advance our understandings of teacher learning, but will provide evidence that teachers can recognize, value, and leverage students' diverse resources for engineering. Research on the TEEP program will also provide much-needed empirical support on whether and how online programs can be effective for teachers' instructional practice."

Seeking ways to seamlessly build computational thinking in to high school curricula is one way to prepare students for this future.  Because computer science courses are unavailable in most schools, integrating computational thinking into existing high school courses may be better suited to provide a solution to this gap in students' preparation.  This project will develop a robust infrastructure using the open source statistical program R to support the infusion of computational thinking into high school mathematics courses.  Three online curriculum modules will be developed that integrate computational thinking practices: a) interpreting categorical and quantitative data, b) making inferences and justifying conclusions, and c) linear, quadratic, and exponential models.  The proposed online learning platform will provide wide access to the computing resources, learning resources, and teacher supports.  The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).<br/><br/>Linking mathematics to everyday problem solving, mathematical modeling is an iterative cyclic process that involves identifying and selecting variables to represent a situation, choosing mathematical representations to describe the variables and their relationships, performing mathematical operations to draw conclusions, interpreting and validating the conclusions against the situation, and iteratively improving the model.  In the same spirit, computational thinking is the process of formulating problems and solutions in terms of computational steps and algorithms that can be executed by computers.  Both practices aim to connect the real world with the model world, either mathematical or computational, to create solutions to problems.  This project focuses on the coupling of these two strategies.  For example, one focus of the project is an investigation of how variations of coupling strategies impact learning.  This project will systematically manipulate design patterns and compare students' learning outcomes and learning processes across three field tests with Module A.  The steps in a computational mathematical modeling cycle can be grouped into subsets for initial task classes to reduce the complexity of dealing with the entire cycle; however, doing so may decrease the level of authenticity and richness of the tasks. Finding a good balance between engagement and cognitive load control will be the focus of this phase of the study."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This project will achieve these aims by identifying and closely evaluating critical factors and processes that are necessary to effectively broaden access and sustain professional learning (PL) for educational professionals working within informal STEM learning (ISL) settings. The context for this work builds on an evidence-based and nationally field tested professional learning model, Reflecting on Practice (RoP). This model will be refined to provide ISL educators with increased access to a proven PL curriculum via an in-person or blended approach, enhanced localized support, and cultivated regional professional learning communities. There is still little known about the effectiveness of blended PL within informal contexts. The emphasis on greater accessibility to PL is particularly important to the ISL field, given the significant number of informal STEM educators and institutions in underserved and remote locations, often facing disparate and insurmountable challenges in access to high quality STEM professional development. This modular program will not only target a broad range of informal institutions; varying in size, STEM content foci, geographic location and communities served but it is also uniquely designed for institutional customization and adoption, further increasing the likelihood of wide-spread uptake, participation, and engagement. If successful, this broad implementation effort will directly impact over 3,000 informal science educators and professionals in nearly 350 informal STEM learning institutions across the country. <br/><br/>The intended theory of action and iterative, design-based implementation approach will be closely monitored, documented and analyzed by an experienced team of external evaluators, using formative and summative evaluative methods. A mixed methods approach will be employed to: (a) examine the effectiveness and accessibility of blended PL and regional PLCs for the ISL field, (b) identify critical design features in blended PL and regional PLCs for impacting educators' practice, (c) determine how PLCs can develop and continue in ISL through looking at what system of support is needed, and (d) ascertain the effective role of the Leaders and Leadership Sites. Data will be collected at all levels - from the RoP directors and PIs, document reviews, interviews and observations with RoP leaders at the six partnering institutions, and surveys with the RoP facilitators (n=700) and informal STEM educator participants (n=2,000).  The results of the findings could be instrumental in the development of future frameworks and models designed to broadly disseminate similar professional learning models effectively within ISL contexts."

The project will be guided by findings from prior research in two areas: the learning outcomes of game-like, simulation-based digital learning environments, and the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems.  The system being developed in this project will construct analytic models of student knowledge and behavior from clickstream data and provide contextualized information at optimal junctures to students or teachers.  This approach will enable a three-layered response system: a) direct, targeted support to individual students struggling with basic content; b) referral of a student to another student or group of students having encountered similar learning challenges; and c) feedback to teachers that would facilitate strategic guidance of student learning.  Research questions guiding this project will focus on what information about student learning is most useful for guiding learning in digital environments, how can this information improve support for student learning within classrooms, and how does the availability and use of this information improve student knowledge and practices?

Research shows that early mathematics experiences in everyday life are critical to the development of children's mathematical knowledge. This project will explore an innovative approach to fostering parent-child math interactions and conversations related to mathematical ideas. The approach will use community-based, exhibit installations called Mathscapes. These are artistic, culturally relevant, easily accessible, physical installations designed to encourage adults and children (ages 3 to 7) to use their immediate environment to playfully explore key early math concepts. The project also addresses a need for research about the cultural experiences and resources that marginalized children and families bring to mathematical conversations. Understanding parent-child interactions about mathematics community settings could result in new knowledge about early math learning among low income children and parents. As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. <br/><br/>This exploratory study will design and investigate an innovative approach to encouraging math talk and math-related interactions between parents and children (ages 3-7) through the creation of MathScapes. These are temporary physical installations designed to use the immediate environment to playfully explore mathematical concepts. This study will be conducted in two Boston neighborhoods that are populated by low-income, non-dominant minority and immigrant families. Adopting a case study approach, the project will use observational methods, discourse analysis of parent/child talk, and interviews to study the interactions of 200 families at two neighborhood Mathscape installations. LENA devices will be used to capture parent/child talk at the Mathscapes while researchers use observational methods to document participant interactions, talk, and gestures. Data sources will include audio recordings of family talk, field notes of family interactions at Mathscape installations, surveys, and interviews. A qualitative approach will be used to produce research findings at multiple levels. The focus of the analysis will be to understand if this approach enhances the quality and quantity of math talk between parents and children.  The project will be carried out by a research-practice-community partnership in Boston, Massachusetts that includes community mathematics educators, education researchers, and participating children and families. The design of community installations could promote engagement with math through adult/child conversations in culturally-relevant contexts situated in the local environment. By addressing the cultural experiences and resources of young people, the project could greatly enhance our understanding of how to leverage the resources that children and families bring to engaging with mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The project will adapt and study a promising and replicable teacher professional development (PD) intervention, called Collaborative Math (CM), for use in early childhood programs.  CM content will focus on nine topics emphasized in preschool mathematics, including sets, number sense, counting, number operations, pattern, measurement, data analysis, spatial relationships, and shape.  These concepts are organized around Big Ideas familiar in early math, are developmentally appropriate and foundational to a young child's understanding of mathematics. The project addresses the urgent need for improving early math instruction for low-income children. Prepared as generalists, preschool teachers typically acquire less math knowledge in pre-service training than their colleagues in upper grades, which reduces their effectiveness in teaching math.  To address teacher PD needs, the project will simultaneously develop teacher content knowledge, confidence, and classroom practice by using a whole teacher approach.  Likewise, the project will involve teachers, teacher aides, and administrators through a whole school approach in PD, which research has shown is more effective than involving only lead teachers.  Through several phases of development and research, the project will investigate the contributions of project components on increases in teacher knowledge and classroom practices, student math knowledge, and overall implementation. The project will impact approximately 200 Head Start (HS) teaching staff, better preparing them to provide quality early math experiences to more than 3,000 HS children during the project period.  Upon the completion of the project, a range of well-tested CM materials such as resource books and teaching videos will be widely available for early math PD use. Assessment tools that look at math knowledge, attitudes, and teacher practice will also be available. <br/><br/>The project builds on Erikson Institute research and development work in fields of early math PD and curriculum.  Over a 4-year span, project development and research will be implemented in 4 phases: (1) adapting the existing CM and research measures for HS context; (2) conducting a limited field study of revised CM in terms of fidelity and director, teacher/aide, and student outcomes, and study of business as usual (BAU) comparison groups; (3) a study of the promise of the intervention promise with the phase 3 BAU group (who offered baseline in phase 2) and (4) a test of the 2nd year sustainability intervention with phase 3 treatment group. The teacher and student measures are all published, frequently used measures in early childhood education and will be piloted and refined prior to full implementation. The project is a partnership between Erikson, SRI, and Chicago Head Start programs.  Project research and resources will be widely disseminated to policy makers, researchers, and practitioners."

Ratios and proportional relationships are a critical foundation for mathematics and science, yet they pose perennial challenges for students and teachers. Investigating Proportional Relationships from Two Perspectives (InPReP2) will examine how future teachers develop understandings of proportional relationships in mathematics courses they take as part of their preparation programs. The project will collect data in teacher preparation courses and through interviews during which future teachers solve problems about proportional relationships. The courses and interviews will be based on a potentially transformative approach to ratio and proportional relationships, which has been overlooked by past research. The project will also conduct a study comparing how preservice middle grades and secondary grades mathematics teachers at the University of Georgia (UGA) and Kennesaw State University (KSU) reason about proportional relationships. Discoveries about what is easier and what is harder for future teachers to learn will be used to identify key targets for instruction that better prepare future teachers to help their students with critical, yet difficult, middle grades mathematics. <br/><br/>Past research suggests teachers' difficulties with proportional relationships, covariation, and multiplicative relationships are likely to have roots deep in the multiplicative conceptual field, yet this same research has not examined those roots directly. InPReP2 will examine how preservice middle school teachers' capacities to reason about multiplication and division in terms of quantities support and constrain their facility with proportional relationships. InPReP2 will also investigate proportional relationships based on two complementary perspectives, one that makes covariation visually explicit with double number lines and one that makes multiplicative relationships between quantities visually explicit with strip diagrams. The central hypothesis for InPReP2 is that the two perspectives may facilitate both key features of proportional relationships and open new pathways that make subsequent topics more accessible. InPReP2 will investigate methods that coordinate detailed case studies with recent advances surveying multiplicative reasoning in large, national samples. InPReP2 will also examine in both clinical and experimental settings how different initial strengths and weaknesses with multiplicative reasoning affect how future teachers make sense of the two perspectives on proportions and applications. InPReP2 results about multiplicative reasoning will inform improved teacher education and professional development content courses that prepare teachers across the nation for standards that emphasize sense making with quantities. Teachers with an understanding of proportional relationships in terms of quantities will be better prepared to support their students' reasoning about co-variation and multiplicative relationships, which is fundamental to college readiness. InPReP2 methods will advance STEM education research by investigating how Diagnostic Classification Models, in combination with measures of reasoning, can be used to coordinate surveys of large samples with detailed case-studies of small samples. Such methods have broad implications for generating generalizable findings about learning in complex, multi-faceted domains. InPReP2 will integrate training of new mathematics education researchers and teacher educators into all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award explores ""backward transfer"", or the ways in which new learning impacts previously-established ways of reasoning.  The PI will observe and evaluate students in four Algebra I classrooms as they learn quadratic functions. The PI will examine how different kinds of instruction about the new concept of quadratic functions helps or hinders students' prior mathematical knowledge of the previous concept of linear functions.  More generally, this award will contribute to the field of mathematics education by expanding the application of knowledge transfer, moving it from only a forward focused direction to include, also, a backward focused direction.  An advisory board of scholars with expertise in mathematics education, assessment, social interactions, quantitative reasoning and measurement will support the project.  The research will occur in diverse classrooms and result in presentations at the annual conferences of national organizations, peer-reviewed publications, as well as a website for teachers which will explain both the theoretical model and the findings from the project.  An undergraduate university course and professional development workshops using video data from the project are also being developed for pre-service and in-service teachers.  Ultimately, the research findings will generate new knowledge and offer guidance to elementary school teachers as they prepare their students for algebra.  <br/><br/>The research involves three phases.  The first phase includes observations and recordings of four Algebra I classrooms and will test students' understanding of linear functions before and after the lessons on quadratic functions.  This phase will also include interviews with students to better understand their reasoning about linear function problems.  The class sessions will be coded for the kind of reasoning that they promote.  The second phase of the project will involve four cycles of design research to create quadratic and linear function activities that can be used as instructional interventions.  In conjunction with this phase, pre-service teachers will observe teaching sessions through a course that will be offered concurrently with the design research.  The final phase of the project will involve pilot-applied research which will test the effects of the instructional activities on students' linear function reasoning in classroom settings.  This phase will include treatment and control groups and further test the hypotheses and instructional products developed in the first two phases.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

The project is a partnership involving the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, University of Chicago STEM Education at the University of Chicago, and the Learning Sciences Research Institute at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Investigators will use prototype learning trajectories (LTs) for CT in grades K-5 to design instructional materials that integrate CT into fractions instruction in grades 3-5. By studying implementation of these materials in elementary school classrooms, the project will (a) refine the LTs, (b) better understand how synergies between elementary mathematics and CT might be leveraged to create effective and efficient integrated instruction, and (c) generate evidence related to the effect of CT-infused mathematics instruction on students' understanding of fractions. The project is funded by the STEM+Computing Program, which seeks to study the applied integration of computational thinking and computing within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). <br/><br/>This project is designed to facilitate the integration of CT in mathematics in elementary school. It builds on an earlier NSF-funded exploratory project by, (a) refining and elaborating a set of CT learning trajectories for grades 3 to 5 related to CT concepts of problem decomposition, repetition/looping, conditionals, and debugging in the mathematical context of fractions and (b) carrying out research into children's learning of mathematics and CT when math + CT is taught in an integrated program. To accomplish these goals, the project will develop instructional materials that can be used to teach integrated math + CT in grades 3-5. Mathematics instruction will be based on the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, as realized in Everyday Mathematics 4, the elementary program from the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project. The project's efforts will focus on the Common Core's Number and Operations with Fractions (NF) domain. All instructional materials will be designed to maximize accessibility and engagement of academically diverse learners by using the Universal Design for Learning framework as an instructional guide for curriculum development. The project will use a mixed-methods approach to study the mathematics and CT learning that occurs and to understand the specific challenges students encounter when interacting with the materials. Student measures will be developed using an evidence-centered design process. These assessments include CT assessments newly created or modified from currently available assessments for older students, automated static analysis of students' computational artifacts, and measures of the Common Core's NF domain based on assessments embedded in the Everyday Mathematics instructional materials. Additionally, video screen recordings of purposefully selected students will be analyzed using the Collaborative Computing Observation instrument to evaluate the effectiveness of the activities as well as successes and challenges the students experience with the CT and mathematics activities. Teacher data will include classroom observations, interviews, and teacher reflections."

The research approach investigates (1) how and when to present the multi-channel input based on human-computer-interaction design principles and informed by teacher usability studies; (2) how to optimize statistical approaches to handle unstructured data from multiple sources; and (3) how to create behavioral signatures for constructs such as self-regulation, motivation and frustration using multi-modal measures such as eye-tracking and facial expression.  The ultimate goal of MetaDash is to foster STEM learning by supporting teachers' and students' monitoring and control of CAMM SRL processes. As such, MetaDash will advance current dashboards by providing teachers with: (1) multichannel STEM learning and cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) self-regulated learning (SRL) data collected from students; and (2) individual student and aggregate data to accelerate teachers' decision-making."

STEM schools continue to be an important policy area and test bed for one indication of what STEM education can accomplish under the most optimal conditions in which STEM is the focus of students' learning experiences. The President has called for the creation of an additional 1,000 STEM schools with relatively little evidence about the impact of such schools or the evidence of which configurations and elements of such schools are important. The study's focus is on the extent to which inclusive STEM high schools contribute to improved academic outcomes, interests in STEM careers, and expectations for post secondary study. The research study engages in implementation research to examine the elements of the STEM schools' design and implementation and other contextual factors, including state policies, which are associated with superior outcomes. <br/><br/>This is a quasi-experimental study of the effects of attending an inclusive STEM high school comparing outcomes for students in these schools with those of their counterparts attending other types of schools in the same states. The study includes all students in the 9th or 12th grade in the inclusive STEM high schools and students in samples of same-state comparison schools identified through propensity score matching. Data are collected longitudinally using student records and surveying students at regular intervals. The study follows the 12th grade students after graduation into postsecondary study and the workforce. The states identified in this study have the requisite administrative data systems to support the proposed study. By using a combination of data available in state-level data bases and new information obtained through project surveys, the researchers are identifying students who are matched not only on demographic variables and academic achievement before high school entry, but also on indicators of pre-existing interest and expectation such as self-efficacy and prior participation in informal STEM-related activities. Impacts on student achievement are analyzed separately for each state. Data on the elements of STEM schools are collected through teacher and administrator surveys and interviews. State STEM school history and policy data are collected through document analysis and interviews. The study utilizes hierarchical regression models, with separate models of each outcome measure and adjustments for tests of multiple comparisons. Student attrition is monitored and findings are examined to determine influence of attrition. <br/><br/>This project focuses on inclusive rather than selective STEM schools so that the population of students more typically represents the population of the students locally. The study provides a source of evidence about not only the effectiveness of STEM schools, but also contextual evidence of what works and for whom and under what conditions."

The study will focus on student motivation for learning as an important predictor of student choice, persistence, and achievement in STEM careers. It will advance research beyond studies that only examine links between motivation and mathematics achievement to lesser known aspects about how motivation functions to support students' in-the-moment choices during learning. The project will: (1) embed experience sampling questions and enhanced choice options within a Spatial Temporal Math digital platform; (2) examine associations between situated student motivation, choice, and academic outcomes; (3) develop nudge interventions based on these associations and iteratively test nudges in a series of experiments within the platform; and (4) assess the impact of nudges in a randomized trial.

Methods will include surveys, interviews, observations, and other student related tests and school data. Pilot studies will provide data essential to developing interventions that promote deeper learning drawing on motivation theory and behavioral economics. Results from this project will advance theoretical and analytic bases for understanding motivation and choice situated in real-world learning contexts. These new advances will help transform understanding about student motivation and behaviors as well as inform improvements in the teaching and learning of mathematics. In addition to the 30K that will be directly impacted by this study; in real time, the project will help improve learning for more than a million existing users of the digital platform.

As such, this study will help meet future workforce needs by taking a radical approach and looking beyond mathematics as the key major factor that determines student participation in STEM fields. To better understand what these factors might be, this study will examine high school transcripts from two local high schools. It will also review records of 350 undergraduate students who have been enrolled, are currently enrolled, have graduated, switched to another non-STEM field at the same institution, or left undergraduate programs in biotechnology-related fields. Data sources will include information on all mathematics, bioscience, biotechnology-related courses taken in high school and in college; college entrance test scores, and students' performance in bioengineering at the undergraduate level. This study will attempt to initiate a new line of research in search of factors associated with bioscience and bioengineering education as a novel approach for uncovering factors that may negatively influence student participation in these fields.<br/><br/>An interdisciplinary approach will be used to mine and analyze student data at the intersection of mathematics, biosciences, engineering, and technology. Although it is unclear if this approach will generate any new insights potentially beneficial to society, knowing whether the idea works or not will be a valuable contribution to the field. Additionally, this approach will not only be relevant to biosciences and bioengineering, but also important to national efforts, and will contribute to NSF's Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution. However, attempting to merge data sets from multiple sources is risky since it may not reveal any meaningful information useful to addressing student retention. Such risks may be further compounded by the limited focus of the study on mostly content driven factors, a wide variation of pathways and classes, availability of courses, personal variation of student development, and motivation and interest in particular STEM subjects. Due to the complexity of this undertaking and the focus largely on student performance and success in these fields, the risk is high. These risks notwithstanding, outcomes from this study could potentially identify factors, other than mathematics, that might contribute to current attrition rates.

Computational Thinking (CT) is a relatively new educational focus and a clear need for learners as a 21st century skill. This proposal tackles this challenging new area for young learners, an area greatly in need of research and learning materials. The Principal Investigators will develop and implement integrated STEM+C museum exhibits and integrate CT in their existing engineering design based PictureSTEM curriculum for K-2 students. They will also pilot assessments of the CT components of the PictureSTEM curriculum. This work will make a unique contribution to the available STEM+C learning materials and assessments. There are few such materials for the kindergarten to second grade (K-2) population they will work with. They will research the effects of the curriculum and the exhibits with a mixed methods approach. First, they will collect observational data and conduct case studies to discover the important elements of an integrated STEM+C experience in both the formal in-school setting with the curriculum and in the informal out-of-school setting with families interacting with the museum exhibits. This work will provide a novel way to understand the important question of how in- and out-of-school experiences contribute to the development of STEM and CT thinking and learning. Finally, they will collect data from all participants to discover the ways that their activities lead to increases in STEM+C knowledge and interest. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will build on an integrated STEM curriculum by integrating CT and develop integrated museum exhibits. They base both activities on engineering design implemented through challenge based programming activities. They will research and/or develop assessments of both STEM+C integrated thinking and CT. Their research strategy combines Design Based Research and quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the materials for learning CT. In the first two years of their study, they will engage in iterations on the design of the curriculum and the exhibits based on observation and case-study data. There will be 16 cases that draw from each grade level and involve data collection for the case student in both schools and museums. They will also use this work to illuminate what integrated STEM+C thinking and learning looks like across formal and informal learning environments.

Investigators begin with a set of constructs and measures that are known to predict student learning on high-level mathematics assessments (high-cognitive-demand instruction) and that are associated with teachers' capacity to enact ambitious instruction (teacher social capital). The objective is to distill the measurement of these constructs to a core set of survey indicators that are predictive of student outcomes, can be administered efficiently at scale, and are consequential for state policy makers' decision making. Using a 3-tiered approach - in-depth data collection from an intensive sample of teachers (n=50), less comprehensive data from an intermediate sample (n=100), and survey-based data from a scale sample, a group that will increase in number each year, ending in year 3 with 1000 teachers or approximately 10% of TN's grades 4-8 mathematics teachers - the analyses leverage in-depth qualitative examination of mathematics instruction and teacher social capital in dialogue with survey-based approaches to construct a validity argument (Kane, 2006) that 1) teachers vary on proxy measures of central constructs, 2) measures of these proxies are correlated with other theoretically relevant measures, and 3) these proxies are predictive of student learning and high-quality teaching, respectively, in the scale sample.<br/>Previous research on cognitive demand has provided both theoretical and empirical warrants for the connection between teaching and student learning. This project extends that work by establishing proxies for high-cognitive-demand instruction and observing their relationship to student learning across hundreds of classrooms. Previous work on teacher social capital has consisted primarily of theory-building, qualitative studies that have shown relationships between specific features of teacher social capital and level of instruction. This study tests that relationship in larger numbers of classroom and extends it to student learning.  Additionally, investigators build a practical theory of how states can support large-scale instructional improvement. While most theorizing and research in this regard has focused on the challenges that states confront in providing professional development for large numbers of teachers, less attention has been paid to the challenge of monitoring the effectiveness and impact of those efforts. This project is based on the idea that just doing more - without systematically learning from what one is doing - is a failing proposition. In the era of current reforms, increasing numbers of states will be devoting substantial resources to improving instruction across their states. By conceptualizing an entire state as a learning environment, this work calls attention to systematic and organized ways to learn from that activity, thereby getting smarter about efficient ways to support large-scale improvement in mathematics.<br/>The development of indicators that can be deployed across an entire state is, in and of itself, a sign of broad impact. In addition, the indicator system is portable and, because it is aligned with college and career ready standards adopted by the majority of states, could be taken up by other states, especially those who have committed to common assessments. Furthermore, if leaders in TN and other states use the indicator system to identify where instruction is flagging and where teacher supports are needed, they will be positioned to make better decisions regarding where and how to assist educators across their states. This, in turn, will support the achievement of the societal goal of improved STEM education that will produce more globally competitive high school graduates. Finally, if this study is successful we will have established a longer chain of evidence than heretofore has been assembled. We will show linkages among (a) teachers' access to social resources; (b) teachers' instructional practice; and (c) student performance."

The project will conduct three studies that will 1) identify how students use the elements of the learning management system content and how that use relates to student performance outcomes in STEM content; 2) test embedded learning strategy training experiences for students and motivational interventions to examine the affordance for student motivation, behavior, achievement, and completion rates; and 3) test whether a behavior-based early warning system will identify problematic learning behaviors earlier and more accurately than existing systems so that interventions might be targeted to the students particular problems. <br/><br/>Four courses in biology, calculus and two engineering domains within the earliest semesters of study at the undergraduate level will be the context of this study. The researchers and instructors from the departments will collaboratively design the learning environments built around Blackboard, the most common learning management system currently in use. The project will collect large grain data currently available from Blackboard of student performances in the system, medium grain data from a secondary module within Blackboard that aggregates behavior and performance and reports at the student level, and small grain data, logs of each student's transaction with the materials hosted in the course. An experimental design will be employed during the project that randomly assigns students different interventions and specific training supports. Data mining techniques, regression and structural modeling approaches will be used to identify patterns and examine the impacts of the training and motivational supports on student learning outcomes in the specified STEM content areas."

Many people, however, have a limited understanding of the scope of these changes because they are geographically distant and difficult to visualize. Although both digital learning tools and online scientific data repositories have greatly expanded over the last decade, there is currently no interface that brings the two together in a way that allows the public to explore these rapidly changing glacial environments. Therefore, to both improve public understanding and provide greater access to already existing resources, the project team will develop the Virtual Ice Explorer to encourage informal learning about glacial environments. This web application will feature an immersive virtual environment and display a suite of environmental data for an array of Earth's glacial systems. An interactive globe will allow users to select from a collection of sites ranging from polar regions to tropical latitudes. Each featured site will offer users an opportunity to interact with (1) a 3D rendering of the landscape; (2) a local map of the site; (3) historical and contemporary photographs of the site; (4) background information text describing the location, past research, and climate impacts; and (5) available environmental data. One of the most original features of the application will be its realistic, immersive 3D rendering of glacial landscapes by combining very high-resolution digital elevation models and satellite imagery with the application's built-in capabilities for immersive virtual environments. Although immersive environments often require expensive equipment, we are maximizing accessibility by developing the Virtual Ice Explorer to run in a web browser and function across various devices. Thus, the application will be available to anyone with internet access, and they can explore at their own pace. <br/><br/>As part of the successful development of Virtual Ice Explorer, the project team will create a platform for digital elevation models to be visualized and explored in 3D by users within the web application; curate digital elevation models, maps, images, text, and environmental data for inclusion in the web application for up to 11 geographically diverse glaciers/glacial landscapes; iteratively user-test the web application with project partners; and design the architecture of the system to readily scale to a larger collection of glaciers/glacial landscapes. To extend dissemination of the final products, the team has partnered with the U.S. Geologic Survey to showcase four benchmark glaciers in their long-term Glaciers and Climate project. In addition to improving understanding of glacier systems in informal learning environments, the project team will explore applications for spatial learning, employment of 3D environments for educational interventions, and use of Virtual Ice Explorer in formal learning environments.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.

What practices are more effective for realizing student success? These questions have received considerable attention in the mathematics education community. The goal of this CAREER program of research is to identify, from a cross-cultural perspective, essential Algebraic Knowledge for Teaching (AKT) that will enable elementary teachers to better develop students' algebraic thinking. Focusing on two fundamental mathematical ideas recently emphasized by the Common Core State Standards - inverse relations and properties of operations - this study explores AKT based on integrated insights of the U.S. and Chinese expert teachers' classroom performance. It will be focused on three objectives: (1) identify AKT that facilitates algebraic thinking and develop preliminary findings into teaching materials; (2) refine research-based teaching materials based on the evaluative data; and (3) integrate research with education through course development at Temple University and teacher outreach in Philadelphia. <br/><br/>The model underlying this research program is that improved pedagogy will improve student learning, both directly and indirectly. A design-based research method will be used to accomplish objectives #1 and #2. Cross-cultural videotaped lessons will be first analyzed to identify AKT, focusing on teachers' use of worked examples, representations, and deep questions. This initial set of findings will then be developed into teaching materials. The U.S. and Chinese expert teachers will re-teach the lessons as part of the refinement process. Data sources will include: baseline and updated survey data (control, context, and process variables), observation, documents, videos, and interviews. The statistical techniques will include descriptive and inferential statistics and HLM will to address the hierarchical nature of the data. <br/><br/>This project involves students and teachers at various levels (elementary, undergraduate, and graduate) at Temple University and the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) in the U.S. and Nanjing Normal University and Nantong School District in China. A total of 600 current and future elementary teachers and many of their students will benefit directly or indirectly from this project. Project findings will be disseminated through various venues. Activities of the project will promote school district-university collaboration, a novice-expert teacher network, and cross-disciplinary and international collaboration. It is anticipated that the videos of expert teaching will also be useful future research by cognitive researchers studying ways to improve mathematics learning."

Thus, elaborating the multitude of variables in informal learning and how those variables can be used for individual learning is yet to be defined for the circumstances of the learners. Thus, the primary objective of this work is to produce robust and detailed evidence to help shape both practice and policy for informal STEM learning in a broad array of common circumstances such as rural, urban, varying economic situations, and unique characteristics and cultures of citizen groups. Rather than pursuing a universal model of informal learning, the principal investigator will develop a series of comprehensive models that will support learning in informal environments for various demographic groups.<br/><br/>The research will undertake a longitudinal mixed-methods approach of Out of School Time/informal STEM experiences over a five-year time span of data collection for youth ages 9-19 in urban, suburban, town, and rural communities. The evidence base will include data on youth experiences of informal STEM, factors that exert an influence on participation in informal STEM, the impact of participation on choices about educational pathways and careers, and preferences for particular types of learning activities. The quantitative data will include youth surveys, program details (e.g. duration of program, length of each program session, youth/facilitator ratio, etc.), and demographics. The qualitative data will include on-site informal interviews with youth and facilitators, and program documentation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early competence with mathematics has proven to be an important predictor of later achievement in school across socioeconomic backgrounds (cf., National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008). It is difficult for schools and districts to maintain a sustained focus on improving math instruction in the elementary years, particularly in low-income and underperforming contexts where these goals are often overshadowed by more pressing needs and issues. Instructional leadership development holds promise for increasing the ability of school-based leaders to understand and support evidence-base practices, improve the quality of instruction, and ultimately improve student achievement (Ingersoll, Sirinides, & Doherty, 2017). The goal of this project is to build instructional leadership capacity in teachers and school-based leaders in a network of underperforming elementary schools with limited resources. Through design-based improvement research, the project is designed to enhance the knowledge, skills, and competencies of elementary teacher leaders and principals to develop a shared vision and provide ongoing support of high-quality math instruction. During the first 3 years of this project, cohorts of 2-4 schools will be added each year for mentored mathematics lead teachers (MLTs) coaching development and strategic school-based leadership support. Each cohort will begin with a year of instructional leadership mentorship, where a university-based consultant with expertise in mathematics instruction works side-by-side with the MLT as they co-participate in coaching activities. The second year of participation will involve a launch phase where MLTs will have the opportunity for monthly check-ins with the mentor while working with more independence with a new set of focal teachers and continuing to participate in the network-wide professional development. By the third year of participation, schools will be expected to assume ownership of the instructional leadership and strategic planning efforts while continuing to participate in network-wide professional community. Concurrently, the project team will offer professional development to MLTs and school-based leaders across all 13 schools, building up an ongoing networked community with different levels of expertise. The multi-year design of the project allows for studying the development of a group of teachers as they transition from mentored novices to more experienced and independent instructional leaders over time. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program, which funds research and development on STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>Building on two years of prior work and relationship building, the project aims to build coherence from the district to school to classroom level, leveraging the resources of the university to help translate the district vision for instructional improvement into classroom practice. In particular, the project focuses on developing shared understanding of high quality math instruction at the network level, strategic planning for math instructional leadership at the school level, and mentorship for lead teachers to provide effective instructional coaching at the classroom level. Development goals include: building math leadership capacity within the network, developing and refining a set of tools and routines to support instructional improvement at the classroom, school, network, and district levels, and building a networked community of schools, teachers, and leaders. The overarching problem that this project seeks to address is: How can instructional leadership expertise be developed in newly appointed math lead teachers within a large urban school district? The project will collect data including coaching artifacts such as observation and debriefing forms; mentor logs; interviews with teachers, MLTs, principals, and university-based mentors; and video recordings of coaching cycles. The focus of the data analysis will be to determine coherence and evidence of growth at different levels of the system to continually improve the intervention through a variety of qualitative data analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a better understanding of a learner's state of mind, textbooks can make personalized recommendations for further study and review. How can the learner's state of mind be determined? Open a used printed textbook and the answer is clear: students feel compelled to engage with their texts by annotating key passages with highlights, tags, questions, and notes. Despite students' spontaneous desire to annotate as they read, this form of interaction has reaped few educational benefits in the past. At best, highlighted passages are re-read to study for exams, a strategy not nearly as effective as other strategies such as self-quizzing. This project will develop a new methodology that: assesses student knowledge level automatically based on annotations, transforms highlighted passages into appropriate study questions, and provides each student with well-timed, personalized review. Because the project is based on free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed materials from OpenStax that have been widely adopted at a range of institutions, particularly community colleges, the technology will reach beyond elite institutions to provide a broad spectrum of underserved students with access to a potentially powerful learning tool.<br/><br/>This project adopts a big-data approach that involves collecting annotations from a population of learners to draw inferences about individual learners. The project will determine how to exploit these data to model cognitive state, enabling the team to infer students' depth of understanding of facts and concepts, predict subsequent test performance, and perform interventions that improve learning outcomes. A tool will be developed that administers appropriately timed quizzes on material related to a student's highlights. A collaborative-filtering methodology will be employed that leverages population data to suggest specific passages for an individual to review. The proposed tool will reformulate selected passages into review questions that encourage the active reconstruction and elaboration of knowledge. The design and implementation of the tool will be informed by both randomized controlled studies within the innovative OpenStax textbook platform and coordinated laboratory studies.

Then exploratory research will investigate the opportunities to integrate computational thinking and narrative development by observing educators and preschool children during classroom activities for early literacy instruction. The model of the project's pedagogical foundation will be revised based on findings from the exploratory research. Finally, the project will use multiple design cycles to develop computational literacy learning tasks and conduct formative research on children's computational literacy and teachers' instructional practices while iteratively developing and testing a learning intervention (The Story Emporium). The project will also investigate the promise of the intervention in cultivating preschoolers' computational literacy and narrative competence. The research questions examine what aspects of computational thinking are already present in children's practice with narrative development and language followed by understanding the learning process when children engage with a learning intervention designed to integrate computational thinking and narrative literacy. The learning process will be supported by designing tasks and a digital learning platform. Data to be collected include qualitative data to document student learning, such as video observations, transcript analysis, coding of students' work, and storyboarding tasks for children. Students' knowledge will also be measured using a general literacy measure, computational literacy tasks, a narrative comprehension test, and video observations. Data from teachers will also include classroom observations, interviews, and implementation logs when the educators use the learning intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study is situated in sociocultural theories of learning and development that connect patterns of noticing in the classroom to participation in social and cultural communities. The goal of the study is to extend this framework to noticing for equity in the mathematics classroom using a community-based design approach. The study includes three research questions. (1) What is the relation between the dispositions, noticing practices, and mathematics instruction of secondary mathematics teachers? (2) What activities, tools and frameworks support teachers in learning to notice for equity? (3) How can a community-based design model enhance the conceptualization of noticing for equity and the development of tools/frameworks for teacher learning? The project will include the design of a professional development for two cohorts of secondary teachers in collaboration with community leaders. The project will also develop tools for research that can be used in other projects that investigate teacher noticing for equity in mathematics. Data collected will include teacher interviews, video documentation of teacher and community leader interactions in professional development (including summer design charrettes), other documents and artifacts from the design of tools and resources, and other qualitative data.

Its purpose is to develop a comprehensive framework to inform and investigate treatment effect variation in teacher professional development (PD) studies using multisite moderation studies focused on the variables that affect the direction and magnitude of the relation between the treatment variable and the outcome variable. The study will accomplish four integrated research and education goals. The first goal will develop the statistical theory underlying the effective and efficient design of multisite moderation studies of professional development, and derive formulas for the statistical power and the minimum detectable effect size difference with confidence intervals for moderator effects in two- and three-level multisite randomized and nonrandomized studies. The second goal will apply a framework and statistical theory to empirically estimate the moderator effects and design parameters of existing Elementary Mathematics Specialists (EMS) programs, and demonstrate the calculation of the statistical power and the minimum detectable effect size difference for this EMS program using the formulas derived from the first goal. The third goal will execute the formulas derived from the first doal in the existing free-available software, and develop accompanying software documentation. Finally, the fourth goal will provide graduate students and researchers PD in using the results from this project to design multisite moderation studies. It will include developing curricular and instructional materials on the tools and conducting workshops using these materials.<br/><br/>The proposed research builds on data from an ongoing NSF-funded mathematics teacher PD study, which examines the average effects of the EMS certified teachers with the EMS non-certified teachers that are matched within schools or districts. The CAREER study will gather secondary data from the ongoing work on students' mathematics achievement; teachers' mathematical content knowledge; and covariates and potential moderators, such as type of school district, school, teacher, and student background information. Data analyses will focus on students' mathematics achievement gains empirical estimates of moderator effects using two- and three-level hierarchical linear modeling for moderation analyses; empirical estimates of design parameters necessary for power analyses; and demonstration of calculating the power and the minimum detectable effect size difference for this EMS program. Likewise, the project will develop software and documentation that make the complex statistical concepts broadly accessible and practical to applied researchers to implement the work developed from this study; as well as the training materials and design of the professional development workshops. The project will be evaluated both internally and externally through an advisory board and users of the software and PD materials. The main outcome of this effort will be a framework and tools to increase researchers' capacity to identify the factors and conditions that explain the treatment effect variation in teacher professional development; thus, improving teacher effectiveness through the rigorous evidence of research findings in response to questions regarding ""work for whom, and under what circumstances"", and interpreting and exploring the sources of the treatment effect variations."

Moreover, one tropical cyclone has hit the state every two years since 1851. Although natural disasters are frequent, efforts to understand and support public schools' responses to such disasters are rare. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is an exploratory mixed methods study investigating the impact of vulnerability and resilience in the recovery of North Carolina schools affected by both Hurricanes Florence (2018) and Matthew (2016). Specifically, the study assesses whether schools that were impacted by both storms used organizational learning strategies to recover faster than schools that were impacted by either Hurricane Florence or Matthew alone. The project pursues three research questions: (1) What characteristics predict school district resilience? (2) How does prior disaster experience aid/hinder a resilient recovery? (3) Do students in resilient districts show less learning loss or rebound from learning loss more quickly?<br/><br/>This mixed methods project will involve interviews, focus groups and surveys with school and district personnel in a purposive sample of 15 districts across North Carolina that were heavily impacted by both storms and those that were affected by only one. These qualitative data will be used to derive markers of resilience that will then be used in quantitative analyses. Quantitative comparisons of state-wide data on student outcomes (e.g., achievement, attendance) will also be made across three kinds of districts: those that were affected by both storms, those that were affected by only one storm and those that were not affected at all. Quantitative data will be taken from an existing longitudinal database that includes individual student characteristics, attendance, suspensions and academic performance for all students in North Carolina. The purposive sampling of 15 districts in North Carolina allows for a novel comparison of impact, recovery and organizational learning across two disasters and over time. Disasters can create an opportunity for organizational change leading to greater resiliency in future crises; however, little extant research has focused on whether and how schools recover and remain resilient in the aftermath of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. This project can benefit schools in crisis by providing lessons learned and a roadmap for action to schools that are singularly and repeatedly impacted by natural disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project plans to deliver and improve a constructivist professional development (PD) program called Remake Making for library staff that work with youth in maker spaces. The proposed project will be led by a partnership of the University of Pittsburgh and the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and builds on a pilot facilitation framework developed in an earlier project by this team. The PD program responds to the rapid growth of makerspaces with a constructivist PD program focused on facilitation. Maker spaces are a new service model in many public libraries, part of a broader shift in general library services. Effective facilitation for learning, like that required in makerspaces, is a relatively new facet of librarianship that is not a consistent part of librarian education or PD. The project will work with two local library systems with libraries that have makerspaces but little to no PD opportunities around facilitation.  The project plans to iteratively design and investigate the Remake Making program, its impact on library maker facilitators and their interactions with child and youth learners. This will provide a setting for preliminary research about constructivist PD and the experiences and struggles of staff who facilitate making in libraries within the context of shifting library norms. This project will produce an efficient, maker-friendly PD system for facilitation in makerspaces, applicable to a broad range of informal and formal educators who wish to incorporate facilitated making.<br/><br/>The project plans to conduct an iterative development process involving several cohorts of participants and using multiple data sources which include embedded PD workshop data, participant pre-post surveys, observation of library makerspaces, and interviews/focus groups. A participatory approach will be employed by involving participants in creating and refining research questions within the scope of the project. This approach is designed around inquiry-based improvement, which is experienced by participants as reflective practice or continuous improvement. The proposed project aims to advance knowledge and PD strategies for facilitation in library makerspaces. The research will build knowledge about the efficacy of an innovative constructivist PD program with adaptation as a key feature. The data collected in the context of the development of this innovation will provide opportunities for applied research about informal STEM learning in the context of library maker spaces, and the role that library staff play in facilitating this type of learning."

Research indicates that the average turnover rate is nearly 23% for beginning teachers (compared to 15% for veteran instructors); turnover rates for beginning mathematics teachers are even higher. Many mathematics teachers with three or fewer years' experience begin their careers in high-needs schools and often transfer to low-need schools at their first opportunity.  This reshuffling, as effective teachers move from high- to low-need schools, exacerbates the unequal distribution of teacher quality, with important implications  for disparities in student achievement. Research  increasingly provides insights into the magnitude of mathematics teacher turnover, but has identified only a limited number of factors that influence teachers' career decisions and often fails to capture the complexity of the teacher labor market. Thus, it is essential to understand the features, practices, and local contexts that are relevant to beginning teachers' career decisions in order to identify relevant strategies for retention. This project will address these issues, building evidence-based theories of ways to improve the quality and equity of the distribution of the mathematics teaching workforce.  This support for an early CAREER scholar in mathematics policy will enhance capacity to address issues in the future.<br/><br/>This work will be guided by three research objectives, to: (1) explore patterns in  mathematics teachers' career movements, comparing patterns between elementary and middle school teachers, and between high- and low-need schools; (2) compare qualifications and effectiveness of teachers on different career paths (e.g., movement in/out of school, district, field); and (3) test a conceptual model of how policy-malleable factors influence beginning math teachers' performance improvement and career movements. The PI will use large-scale federal and state longitudinal data on a cohort of teachers who were first-year teachers in 2007-08 and taught mathematics in grades 3-8. Three samples will be analyzed separately and then collectively: a nationally representative sample from the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study (about 870 teachers who represent a national population of nearly 85,970); about 4,220 Florida teachers; and about 2,410 North Carolina teachers. In addition, the PI will collaborate with Education Policy Initiative at Carolina (EPIC) at UNC-Chapel Hill to collect new data from the 2015-16 cohort of first-year teachers in NC (about 800 teachers) and follow them for  2 years. The new data collection will provide detailed and reliable measures on the quality of both pre- and in-service teacher supports in order to understand how they may be linked to teachers' career movements and performance."

Statistical variation plays a critical role throughout statistical investigation.<br/><br/>The project integrates educational and research activities in its design and implementation of a professional development program and research on the professional development. The research addresses three interrelated questions: In a professional development program that encourages reasoning about variation from multiple perspectives and that encourages dilemma, critical reflection, and rational discourse: <br/>1. How do middle and secondary mathematics teachers reason about variation from design, data-centric, and modeling perspectives?<br/>2. In what ways do dilemma, critical reflection, and rational discourse affect teachers' reasoning about variation?<br/>3. How do teachers differently engage with and benefit from dilemma, critical reflection, and rational discourse? <br/><br/>The project relies on multiple data sources and strategically chosen combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods to answer the three research questions. Data sources from two cohorts of teachers include statistics assessments, interviews, video-recordings of program activities, reflective journals, and classroom observations. <br/><br/>The project will examine how teachers reason about variation subsequent to focused instruction and contribute knowledge to in-service middle and secondary mathematics teacher education by targeting characteristics of professional development that might support teachers' reasoning about variation in increasingly sophisticated ways. The project will produce a coherent collection of shareable instructional materials for use in introductory statistics education and teacher education in statistics."

Emphasizing cultural context through personal expression has shown to attract new audiences such as women and minorities; however, balancing accessibility and educational effectiveness remains problematic. Current educational tools often use ""black boxing"" to simplify access, to protect the underlying functionality, and/or to stay commercially competitive.  Innovations are needed where the basic skills of design and making, along with new educational models, can support students' exploration of everyday electronics and critical thinking.  The team will test an after-school model that could be applied in cultural institutions and other venues that would provide students in 4 - 8 grades with multiple computer/electronics-driven puppet design and building workshops.  These workshops will provide opportunities for basic hardware and electronics prototyping, personal cultural expression, and performance.  <br/><br/>The exploratory research and development method involves three steps: the students develop a story-line (narrative) that will incorporate puppets; they learn and apply basic electronics and mechanical crafts to design, build and test their puppets; and they perform their shows to other participants and their families.  Over the course of the project, there will be five workshops: two pilot tests (to test feasibility and design), one mid-project evaluation workshop (to evaluate and re-iterate), and two final workshops conducted by educators, where the research team only observes (to test for transferability). Data collection throughout this development cycle will include video and sound recording, still photography, field notes, pre- and post-questionnaires, and the production of puppet ""artifacts"" during the workshops.  In addition to the data collected in the workshops, the project will produce design documents and educational guidelines, as well as other media (such as instructional video clips), which will be disseminated to educators and researchers.<br/><br/>This work is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments."

Given the importance of cryptography and cybersecurity, the project will introduce a new technology-enhanced STEM education model for engaging children of 7-10 years old, particularly girls, in cryptography and cybersecurity building and STEM identity development as they make and break secret codes. The mystery of the subject, its relevance in today's society, and interactive learning experiences will engage children, and the after-school environment where the project will be performed will provide a safe space for them to learn at their own pace. The important scientific and educational outcomes will include improved understanding of how literacy, self-efficacy, computational thinking, 21st century skills, and interest in cryptography and cybersecurity can be fostered at the elementary school level.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to conduct a systematic investigation of the effective conditions for designing and implementing touch-screen enhanced visuospatial learning curricula that foster STEM interest and career awareness using the unique context of cryptography. An interdisciplinary team of K-12 after-school teacher leaders, education technologists, special educators, computer scientists, and STEM education researchers will design a 6-week, 24-hour program of cryptography focused apps and activities for upper elementary students (grades 3-5) in after-school programs that serve primarily girls and African American students. To encourage adoption and facilitate dissemination, the Codebreakers curriculum will be available online in the form of an interactive, touch-friendly website. A mixed-method research design will employ a range of methods including phenomenology, comparative case studies, pretest-posttest analyses, and mixed-effects modeling. The project will use qualitative data to explore students' and teachers' perceptions and experiences with the Codebreakers activities and technology. Quantitative data will be used to make inferences regarding the quantifiable impacts of the strategy on the development of students' self-efficacy, interest and identity in STEM, evolution of their understanding of cryptography and cybersecurity, and the development of their morphological awareness. Ongoing professional development (PD) and support will be provided face-to-face during bi-weekly meetings with teacher leaders and using the Codebreakers online social network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet despite volumes of policy guidance, on-the-ground effort, and research over the past decades, few comprehensive and representative portraits of teacher and teaching quality in U.S. classrooms exist. Instead, most research into these topics has been conducted with small or nonrepresentative samples, with the result that it is difficult to ascertain what, if any, progress has been made toward the three goals. Unlike student achievement, which the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked for almost 50 years, the classroom experiences of the typical U.S. student remain obscure. <br/><br/>To address this issue, the 4-year descriptive study will begin by systematically tracking key instructional indicators in middle school mathematics classrooms, specifically, teachers' mathematical knowledge, the curriculum in place, and the nature of mathematics instruction offered to students. To initiate this line of research, the research team will collect data in 2015 from a national representative sample of 600 U.S. middle school mathematics teachers. A written survey will build on one conducted in 2005-06, allowing for the comparison over time of teachers' curriculum use and mathematical knowledge. The research team will also record and score videos of instruction from a subset of these teachers, enabling both a description of current instruction and a comparison to lessons captured during the 1999 TIMSS video study. Both the survey and video datasets can serve as referents for future studies of instruction, for instance, studies investigating whether student participation in the development of mathematical ideas has changed over time. The research team will use both old and new technologies to complete the study. The mail survey will consist of existing items that tap teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, or the professional knowledge teachers draw upon in providing mathematics instruction to children. To conduct the video study, they will mail tablets for teachers to record their own instruction, and guidance on taping will be provided via YouTube video. The lessons that result will be scored using the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) instrument. The MQI measures key dimensions of mathematics classrooms, including the proportion of class time spent on mathematical tasks, the mathematical integrity of lesson content, and the nature of student participation in the development of mathematical ideas. Video and data from the survey will be made available to other researchers for scoring with other methods and observation instruments. Teachers, parents and students will be asked to consent to their classroom videos being made available. The study is largely descriptive, as are many others of its kind. However, describing the range of U.S. instruction can have a profound effect on the field, much as the TIMSS video studies did over a decade ago. Establishing methodologies for studying teachers and teaching at scale will contribute to efforts to evaluate and monitor progress toward broad-reaching national goals."

This system will be developed in concert with a cognitive apprenticeship training model designed through a series of design studies.  The design studies will be conducted over a two-year period and will include examination of the distinguishing features of various biomonitoring programs, reviews of existing training materials and strategies, expert performance analysis of professional entomologists, and development of user interface features.  Project developers will collaborate with five regional volunteer biomonitoring organizations to engage a diverse set of volunteers in the design process, including rural populations, older adults, urban youth, and the trainers who support them.  The project work will consist of four integrated strands of activity: design-based learning research, creation of an entomological teaching collection, cyberplatform development, and the external evaluation of the training system.

This proposal tackles this challenging new area at the high school level by leveraging a curriculum designed to integrate mathematics and computing to improve learning in both to understand how learning these two subjects together can lead to improvement in both students' understanding and teachers' perceptions of and knowledge about these subjects. Understanding the ways that learning mathematics impacts learning computing and vice-versa is an important research goal. Learning computing is vital for preparing today's students for the many job opportunities available in this area. In addition, the project will train over 600 teachers in diverse schools in using this curriculum, leading to a strong possible impact on improving learning and retention in STEM and computing.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the ways that learning mathematics and programming mutually influence each other. The project uses the Bootstrap curriculum in which students program videogames. Bootstrap is a function-based computing language that targets important algebraic concepts. The curriculum is designed around key mathematical practice standards to help teachers incorporate it into their existing courses. The research on student learning will focus on: 1) which of the intended concepts transfer from Bootstrap to algebra, 2) the type of scaffolding that best supports this transfer, and 3) the aspects of the curriculum that contribute to that transfer. The research on teachers will focus on: 1) the effect of using Bootstrap on teacher perceptions of connections between math and computing, 2) the aspects of the curriculum's pedagogical style and the professional development provided that affect teachers skill and confidence level teaching computing, and 3) possible differential effects for teachers whose primary area was mathematics or computing prior to using Bootstrap. In addition to the 200 teachers the project team has already trained, they will train an additional 600 teachers over the course of the project.

The CAP will serve predominantly minority and low-income high school students and those with special needs in urban and rural areas where enrollment in postsecondary institutions is below the state average. While the CAP has been successful in raising postsecondary enrollment, a series of new digital experiences will be created and added to the program to further students' college readiness and increase their interest in STEM fields. CAP students will be provided opportunities to access a variety of playlists on a digitized platform that will monitor and rewards personalized learning. Tailored to students' interests and strengths, playlists will be designed to inspire motivation, advance college knowledge, and enhance particular skill sets. Students who successfully complete their playlists will earn a badge, which is a publicly shareable digital credential that will show evidence of a substantive learning outcome. Badges will entitle students to participate in STEM internships experiences in businesses and university programs that, when completed, will indicate a set of competencies that can positively impact their postsecondary acceptance when included on college applications.   <br/><br/>Collaboratively developed with CAP personnel, businesses, and university partners, the playlists will be designed to ensure that the badges and internships will provide clear paths to higher education and careers. Consisting of a series of primers, the gamified playlists will enable students to: set goals; pace their learning activities; receive embedded feedback; and receive a tangible reward upon completion. Students will engage in unique, customized knowledge and skill-building learning experiences not typically found in high schools, but will be viewed as advantageous for admission and persistence in higher education. The social and emotional experiences students will have during these experiences will be measured using smartphone technology synced to a technological playlist/badge platform. Data retrieved from the smartphones will be analyzed using multivariate methods that account for multiple differences between students. This empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the playlist experiences will allow for the collection of data to support the inclusion of technological tracking and strategic planning in programs that will improve college-going rates and enhance participation in STEM for underrepresented students."

This project will study a new model, as a small scale exemplar of how science learning can be integrated into cultural events that attract audiences who do not identify themselves as interested in science or broader concepts associated with STEM.  The model integrates science with art, music and play, producing live events, games, hands-on workshops, and interactive theater productions that are intended to inspire wonder and excitement. The basic principles are: to create unique opportunities for audiences to experience science in unorthodox ways, to connect with audiences at these events, and to help scientists engage a public they do not normally reach.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to formally study and improve upon the practices that have been explored to date by carefully examining the implementation at two annual FIGMENT arts festivals in New York City and to determine outcomes based on three theoretical frameworks: the six strands of science engagement proposed by the National Research Council, the concept of follow-up activity, and subsequent reinforcing experiences. Initial evaluation results indicate the model is effective in advancing informal STEM learning and providing valuable public engagement with science training and experience for scientists.  Participating scientists succeed in creating interest and attentiveness in audiences that do not normally engage in science, thereby opening the door for subsequent experiences.  The research will be a quasi-experimental approach to test the degree to which encounters with model's learning experiences create a higher probability to actively seek subsequent science experiences.  Project deliverables include a how-to guide for professionals on expanding STEM audiences targeted at cultural institutions who want to incorporate science content into their activities, and for other institutions who want to integrate their activities into cultural settings.

During the three year grant period, the project will implement the following activities: a four-week summer apprenticeship with a near-peer mentoring program; host an annual STEM Girls Rock Convocation; offer Spring Break STEM Tours for apprentices, their parents/caregivers and mentors, and Hinds Community College STEM instructors; offer after-school and Saturday science fair project assistance; and collaborate with the Shodor Foundation, a nonprofit research and education organization and a national resource for computational science education, to offer workshops for high school teachers, counselors and administrators.<br/><br/>The primary focus of the proposed project is to grow the pipeline of female students who are aware of STEM and computer science educational pathways and career opportunities. The goals of the project are to: 1) Provide evidence of engaging minority females in hands-on experiences in STEM-related technologies and practices; 2) Document evidence of advancing knowledge on how best to prepare minority females for STEM-related occupations; and 3) Build and expand the research foundation on STEM learning and learning environments, workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The project includes an infrastructure mechanism for teachers and administrators within the high school to support students by providing them opportunities to build their academic skills while participating in the project. A concurrent mixed methods research design will be used that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the latent variables."

The Education Alliance at Brown University, which will evaluate the project, is a supporting partner together with the Community College of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation and the Concord Consortium. <br/>Rhode Island Technology Enhanced Science (RITES) is based upon structural reform initiated with the support of the Governor. An action plan developed by a PK-16 council resulted in an investment of $15 million to establish a permanent STEM Center that features two new tenure track positions and will provide support to all schools.  The comprehensive statewide STEM education reform also has support from all levels of government and academia and RITES represents a valuable experiment in organization and structure within that effort.  <br/>The RITES project will, in five years of NSF funding, transform the quality of science teaching and learning at all secondary schools, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of students who are proficient in science and pursue careers in Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM).  The heart of the project is the seamless integration of all segments of the Rhode Island educational community (i.e., teachers and school systems, higher education science departments and schools of education, the various state offices that monitor and support STEM education and the private sector). <br/>RITES will impact all 686 middle school and high school teachers and all of their 83,339 students with excellent, challenging, computer-based, standards-aligned, science materials.  Pairs of high schools and feeder middle schools will join the Partnership together by developing a unified, comprehensive, middle and high school science action plan that will integrate RITES resources, for professional development of teachers and materials for students, with school needs and ongoing school reform.  Schools that participate in the project will be expected to have the active engagement of the school leadership and at least 75% of the science teachers.  Teachers will attend short courses not only to deepen their content knowledge and pedagogy but also to learn how to customize the newly designed curricular materials for their own classrooms. <br/>The comprehensive evaluation plan will include annual reviews of the New England Common Assessments Program (NECAP) science assessment,which will be administered for the first time in Spring 2008.  Results will be disaggregated by race, gender and disabilities and income. Specific benchmarks for student achievement, teacher professional development and workforce diversity will be used to track progress."

Learning the specific mechanistic details of natural phenomena and devices is often envisioned as an ideal goal of STEM learning, yet such information is typically forgotten soon after instruction by children, as well as by adults.  The researchers will pursue the hypothesis that such mechanisms should still be taught because, after the specific details have been forgotten, what remains promotes enduring representations and facilitates higher order learning. This alternative view emphasizes learning that much more closely mirrors how informal science (and often formal science as well) actually works. This project will build on recent cognitive science discoveries about the kinds of knowledge that are most robustly represented both in folk science and in formal science. Four sets of experiments will explore developmental changes in preferences for mechanistic explanations, what is retained from exposure, the effects of different learning goals on the use of mechanistic information in learning STEM content, and the development of abilities to infer internal mechanistic structures. If the hypothesis is supported, the results will suggest that exposure to causal mechanistic information is essential to early science education and that such content should not be omitted even though its details are forgotten. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning, and has implications for education in both formal and informal settings. <br/><br/>This project will involve four sets of randomized controlled experiments, primarily with children at grades K, 2, and 4. Study Set 1 will explore the cognitive basis and development of children's preference for explanations that involve a causal mechanism.  The researchers will use a choice paradigm that contrasts mechanistic explanations with other forms of information. Children will be asked which explanation they would like to learn more about for a given object. Strong preferences for mechanistic information are predicted at all ages, but with developmental differences relating to overall complexity, the domains queried, and kinds of mechanism involved. Study Set 2 will present children with mechanistic explanations for devices and biological entities. Children will then be assessed for retention of mechanistic details, functional properties, non-mechanistic details, judged complexity, broad causal patterns such as causal centrality and potency, and which of two experts to consult to learn more about the entity.  These children will be compared to control children who will also learn about the same internal parts but with no causal or functional language that reveals mechanism. Rapid decay of detailed mechanistic information is expected in both groups, but the mechanism group should show more enduring memories for information relating to complexity, centrality, and expertise domains.  Study Set 3 will focus on goal framing. The researchers will first look at children's and adults' intuitions about what is retained after exposure to causal mechanistic explanations, expecting a strong explicit bias favoring retention of vivid details and a neglect of what actually endures and is most often used.  Later studies will ask how different learning goals interact with mechanism instruction. Greater enjoyment, engagement, feelings of accomplishment and retention of information are predicted with learning goals stressing more cognitively feasible and useful outcomes. Study Set 4 will focus on complexity intuitions. The investigators will look at how internal complexity is inferred for devices and animals based on behavioral diversity. They will also explore how mechanistic complexity is instantiated in different domains."

Specifically, the project will use computer modeling and flight simulations as mechanisms to provide unique entres to STEM and STEM careers for predominately underrepresented elementary and middle school students in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Named for the first African-American woman to receive a pilot's license, the Bessie Coleman Project builds on extant knowledge and understandings of complex systems in aviation and aerospace to develop, implement, and test the impact of a culturally specific, place-based, thematic curriculum and extension activities on youth engaged in informal STEM learning programs related to computer science. This focus on the intersectionality of computer science learning and 21st century information and communications technology (ICT) skill preparation is a national priority at the forefront of educational reform. Research has shown strong evidence that computer coding can motivate student learning and broaden student opportunities in STEM. Likewise, research has shown encouraging benefits of students learning coding as a pathway to develop computational thinking skills. K-12 schools, academic institutions, and informal STEM education sectors across the country are particularly interested in effective strategies to prepare teachers and students in computer science and coding, particularly youth from underrepresented groups in STEM. This project explores the potential and impact of the Bessie Coleman Project as an effective approach to address this national need among three critically underrepresented groups in computer science in four different states. The findings will advance knowledge applicable for both formal and informal contexts.<br/><br/>Over the three-year project duration, approximately 1,000 rural and urban elementary and middle school students will engage in a broad range of project activities - from 3D computer modeling and game design (grades 4-5), to flight simulation using drones and Raspberry Pi (grades 6-8). The students are predominately of Native American, African-American/Black, Hispanic and Asian descent, participating in after school computer science clubs and summer camps at project sites in Colorado, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. Expeditions to air and space museums, opportunities to engage with field experts, guest speakers, and other extended learning opportunities are integral to the program. Forty-two classroom teachers and 12 informal educators and staff from Boys & Girls Clubs and Makerspaces will receive training to implement and facilitate the program in their site locations.  An iterative research design is used to investigate the three overarching research questions: (a) What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students to gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences? (b) What culturally-responsive instructional and curricular practices and models, including place-based education, used by teachers enhance student understanding of and interest in STEM occupations, and what factors influence the outcomes of the practices and models? and (c) In what roles and in what ways do business and industry workforce members (i.e., STEM professionals) motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for STEM careers in the STEM workforce and support teachers in efforts to promote STEM workforce awareness and interest? Formal and summative evaluations are carried out by an Advisory Board and an external evaluator. The research and project findings are locally and nationally disseminated through libraries, a resource guide, a blog, community involvement, conference presentations and journal publications. Ultimately, the project endeavors to increase students' computational thinking abilities, STEM interest and motivation, and persistence in STEM career pathways, especially in computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theme of this conference project by the New York Hall of Science will be exploring how to better design exhibits to promote ""public engagement with science.""  Here, ""public engagement with science"" refers to opportunities that go beyond traditional approaches to the public understanding of science.  The event will invite professionals to consider how to shift exhibit designs toward engaging visitors with STEM in ways that emphasize the intersection of STEM innovation with visitors' daily lives, their personal agency, and their interdependence with their personal social networks and the institutions that advance STEM knowledge and innovation. The conference and its pre- and post-conference activities will bring together curators, exhibition developers, community outreach professionals, museum administrators, and learning scientists from the United States and Canada. They will work together to identify design principles and key obstacles to designing exhibits that can better help science museums achieve two goals: 1) making visitors' diverse and personal questions, concerns, and perspectives central to their experience of the exhibits; and 2) engaging visitors as contributors to the exhibit experience in ways that make their contributions visible and consequential. <br/><br/>During this two-day event attendees will consider how exhibits can support broader and more diverse public participation in critical debates about the roles of STEM discovery and innovation in society.  The effort is grounded in recent work on public engagement with science; on reorganizing museums to become sites for participation and contribution by visitors, and particularly by institutions' local communities; and on making and engineering design programming within museums. The goal is to chart a course toward a vision of the future of science museums in which they maintain their status as sources of trusted information, while also fulfilling their potential as sites of genuine participation and social interaction, in which visitors make meaningful contributions to the substance and workings of the museum floor while also engaging with, learning about and holding themselves accountable to the core concepts and practices of the STEM disciplines.  The conference will build the capacity and collaborative engagement of a network of science centers whose work is central to achieving the museum field's ultimate goal of engaging the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments.

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  This exploratory Pilot study project brings together a diverse set of partners that include the Watertown Children's Theatre (WCT) which is west of Boston, and, from Boston College a team of science educators, learning science researchers, and positive youth development experts. The goal is to design and develop a project for middle school-aged youth. The pilot project, which integrates hands-on science learning experiences, experiments, and field trips with the student-led production of short plays, will engage youth in expressing their beliefs, passions, and their own identities about STEM by examining how the intersection of skills and practices used in both domains (science and theatre) can enable them to learn about science concepts, principles and methods as well as to develop science-focused identities. Middle-school youth will be engaged in a three-week summer program where they will be led by science teachers, playwrights, and high school students to conduct hands-on investigations in science in conjunction with developing original, ten-minute plays around a specific scientific theme relevant to their life experience, for example, the potential impact on their lives of heavy metals in water and poor air quality.  After a science theme is chosen, the principal investigators will identify the big ideas that are important for youth to understand and be able to explain. Upon identification of the key science ideas, youth will then engage in pertinent science activities, visits to local sites, reading current news articles and then in identifying the local impacts and how the underlying science relates to those local impacts.  The youth will perform their ten-minute plays at the end of the summer program. Following this showcase event, they will engage in additional science learning experiences and also revise their productions throughout the academic year in preparation for a youth science festival, where their creations will be performed by professional adult actors as a part of the Cambridge Science Festival taking place in the spring. The broader impact of the work focuses on broadening participation in STEM, specifically, the engagement of youth from under-represented populations in the sciences, such as African-Americans, Latinxs, and women with partner Boston Public Schools.  The Pilot study will investigate the student learning and organizational dimensions of the model being developed. <br/><br/>The Boston College researchers will study youth's sense of purpose and identity toward science, particularly how youth's identity discrepancy changes through participation in the project. The work places youth voice at the center of the creation of STEM-based theatre plays. The theoretical foundation of the work is grounded in part in the concept of ""path to purpose.""  The major research questions are: How do youth perceptions (interest, science anxiety, identity) toward science shift as they participate in the project?  What is the residual impact on parents (family members) and youth on their discussions about science, and how does participation in the project impact those discussions?  Research methods include surveys, interviews and observations.  The external evaluation study will focus on understanding project implementation and progress toward meeting the project goals, in particular, how well the initiative works to establish a model for the informal STEM learning field that the team and others can apply beyond the Pilot study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, however, most empirical studies investigating the theorized inter-relations between oral vocabulary, reading, and mathematics and science difficulties have used small clinical or convenience samples of limited generalizability, included relatively few covariates, and examined the relations concurrently or only over short time periods. Thus, whether and to what extent oral vocabulary difficulties result in reading difficulties and, in turn, mathematics and science difficulties across the elementary grades in the U.S. is largely unknown. This project will examine the inter-relations between oral vocabulary, reading, mathematics, and science difficulties throughout the elementary grades, yielding greater scientific knowledge about the early onset and over-time dynamics of these types of learning difficulties. Doing so should help identify the cognitive, behavioral, affective, and social conditions that collectively interfere with STEM learning including early in children's school careers. These analyses should also inform the delivery and design of STEM interventions at time periods when such interventions may be the most effective.<br/><br/>This project will analyze two nationally representative and longitudinal datasets (i.e., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort and Kindergarten Cohort of 2011, or ECLS-B and ECLS-K:2011) to investigate risk factors for oral vocabulary difficulties prior to or by kindergarten. The team will also examine to what extent oral vocabulary and reading difficulties during kindergarten and 1st grade increase children's risk of experiencing mathematics and science difficulties in later grades. To best address the project's research aims, a range of advanced analytical methods will be used including multilevel modeling, latent growth and growth mixture modeling, and structural equation modeling with random and fixed effects. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to, and opportunities within informal STEM learning (ISL) remain limited for youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds in both the United States and the United Kingdom. However, there is evidence that ISL experiences can expand opportunities for youth learning and development in STEM, for instance, increase positive attitudes towards educational aspirations and future careers/pursuits, improve grades and test scores in school settings, and decrease disciplinary action and dropout rates. Through research and development, this project brings together researchers and practitioners to focus on the experiences, practices and tools that will support equitable youth pathways into STEM. Working across conceptual frameworks and ISL settings (e.g. science centers, community groups, zoos) and universities in four urban contexts in two different nations, the partnership will produce a coherent knowledge base that strengthens and expands research plus practice partnerships, builds capacity towards transformative research and development, and develops new models and tools in support of equitable pathways into STEM at a global level. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. <br/><br/>This Equity Pathways project responds to three challenges at the intersections of ISL research and practice in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) lack of shared understanding of how youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds perceive and experience ISL opportunities across national contexts, and the practices and tools needed to support empowered movement through ISL; 2) limited shared understanding and evidence of core high-leverage practices that support such youth in progressing within and across ISL, and 3) limited understanding of how ISL might be equitable and transformative for such youth seeking to develop their own pathways into STEM. The major goal of this Partnership is for practitioners and researchers, working with youth through design-based implementation research, survey and critical ethnography, to develop new understandings of how and under what conditions they participate in ISL over time and across settings, and how they may connect these experiences towards pathways into STEM. The project will result in: 1) New understandings of ISL pathways that are equitable and transformative for youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds; 2) A set of high leverage practices and tools that support equitable and transformative informal science learning pathways (and the agency youth need to make their way through them); and 3) Strengthened and increased professional capacity to broaden participation among youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds in STEM through informal science learning. The project will be carried out by research + practice partnerships in 4 cities: London & Bristol, UK and Lansing, MI & Portland, OR, US, involving university researchers (University College London, Michigan State University, Oregon State University/Institute for Learning Innovation) practitioners in science museums (@Bristol Science Centre, Brent Lodge Park Animal Centre, Impressions 5, Oregon Museum of Science & Industry) and community-based centers (STEMettes, Knowle West Media Centre, Boys & Girls Clubs of Lansing, and Girls, Inc. of the Pacific Northwest)."

Informal STEM Learning Sites (ISLS) provide opportunities for building interest and engagement in the STEM fields through a multitude of avenues, including the programming that they provide for youth, particularly teens. Frequently, ISLS provide opportunities to participate in volunteer programs, internships or work, which allow teens both to learn relevant STEM knowledge as well as to share that knowledge with others through opportunities to serve as youth educators. While youth educator programs provide rich contexts for teens  to engage as both learners and teachers in these informal STEM environments, research to date has not yet identified the relationship between serving as youth educators and STEM engagement.  Thus, the goal of this project is to document the impact of youth educators on visitor learning in ISLS and to identify best practices for implementing youth educator programs. The project studies STEM interests and engagement in the youth participants and the visitors that they interact with at six different ISLS in the US and UK.  This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.  <br/><br/>This project examines youth educator experiences related to STEM identity, educational aspirations, and motivation. The project also identifies outcomes that the youth educators have on visitors to ISLS in terms of knowledge, interest, and engagement in STEM. The specific aims are: 1) Outcomes for Teens - To measure the longitudinal impact of participation in an extended youth educator experience in an ISLS; 2) Outcomes for Visitors - To compare visitor engagement with and learning from exhibits in ISLS when they interact with a youth educator, relative to outcomes of interacting with an adult educator or no educator; and 3) Outcomes Across Demographics and STEM Sites - To examine differences in visitor engagement based on participant characteristics such as socio-economic status (SES), age, gender, and ethnicity and to compare outcomes of youth educator experiences across different types of ISLS. This research, which draws on expectancy value theory and social cognitive theory, will follow youth participants longitudinally over the course of 5 years and use latent variable analyses to understand the impact on the youth educators as well as the visitors with whom they interact.  Importantly, the results of this research will be used to develop best practices for implementing youth educator programs in ISLS and the results will be disseminated to both academic and practice-based communities.   <br/><br/>This project has clear and measurable broader impacts in a variety of ways. First, the project provides guidance to improve programming for youth in ISLS, including both the sites involved directly in the research and to the larger community of ISLS through evaluation, development, and dissemination of best practices. Additionally, this project provides rigorous, research-based evidence to identify and describe the outcomes of youth educator programs. This study directly benefits the participants of the research, both the visiting public and the youth educators, through opportunities to engage with science. The findings speak to issues of access and inclusivity in ISLS, providing insight into how to design environments that are welcoming and accessible for diverse groups of learners. Finally, this project provides evidence for best practices for ISLS in developing programs for youth that will lead to interest in and pursuit of STEM careers by members of underrepresented groups."

There is a pressing need for elementary science curriculum materials that integrate computational thinking; however, scientifically rigorous, coherent, and developmentally appropriate materials are scarce. This project, Integrating Computational Thinking into the Insights Elementary Science Curriculum, supported by the STEM+C program, will develop such materials by adapting instructional modules from Insights, an elementary science curriculum that promotes students' science sense-making through inquiry, discourse, and reflection. Specifically, four modules in the Insights curriculum, two for grade 1 and two for grade 4, will be developed and pilot tested. Each module is designed for 6-8 weeks of instructional time. This work is important because it creates anchoring points for articulating a developmentally appropriate progression for CT-science integration. Lessons learned during development will generate knowledge about productive ways to integrate CT with science and will identify limitations to effective integration. The project address elementary teachers' lack of preparation to teach CT by providing professional development. Resources, including annotated artifacts of student work and videos of classrooms in which students are engaged in CT-enriched science inquiry, will be integrated into an interactive teacher guide. <br/><br/>Development and pilot testing of the CT-integrated modules and associated teacher supports will involve iterative design-test-revise cycles in three grade 1 and three grade 4 classrooms. Field testing will expand to 18 classrooms per grade. Teachers and school administrators are involved in the design-test-revise process. To achieve its aims, the project team will take four steps: (1) conduct a crosswalk of the 21 Insights elementary science modules with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to produce a provisional scope and sequence for NGSS alignment and CT-science integration; (2) develop and test four revised, NGSS-aligned Insights modules that integrate CT concepts and practices consistent with NGSS and the Computer Science Teachers Association standards; (3) develop teacher supports for implementing the revised Insights modules; and (4) conduct a small comparison study to investigate the impact of the revised Insights modules on student CT and science learning. Results of the comparison study will be used to strengthen CT integration for the revised field test version, support the development of teacher materials, and provide preliminary information about the promise of the revised modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a general lack of engineering knowledge, limited awareness by K-12 teachers about engineering careers, and absence of appropriate role models. Research has shown that early exposure to engineering can significantly increase students' awareness of this discipline as a rewarding career path. The Engineering Academy (EA) at Stony Brook University addresses factors that inhibit involvement in engineering, by engaging students and teachers from low achieving middle schools in the passion, challenges and opportunities of engineering. The project will impact a broad spectrum of participants, with focus on low income students. Students will be exposed to cross-cutting engineering knowledge and skills. Teachers will learn innovative engineering instructional practices that will impact students for many years in the future. Professional engineers will inspire participants by sharing their career experiences; faculty will integrate their expertise in science education and engineering; and Stony Brook University will broaden its vision, mission and role in 6th-8th grade education. The results will be a model for a sustainable and scalable partnership that demonstrates meaningful implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards, addressing student education and teacher professional learning. <br/><br/>This unique program addresses several documented weaknesses in engineering education. It is inspired by successful activities already in place and will provide a model for middle school engineering instruction. The EA will offer activities in several engineering disciplines and computer sciences to students and their teachers in grades 6th-8th. The Student Engineering Academy (SEA) will run after-school sessions during the academic year and a one-week summer camp for a total of about 40 hours of engineering exposure. In addition, 10 in-service teachers per year will chaperone students to the SEA and attend a Teacher Engineering Academy (TEA) that will engage them for a total of forty hours to integrate engineering into mathematics and science instruction.

Yet few studies have examined the impact of professional development on early childhood teachers' science knowledge and skills and in turn, how changes in teachers' knowledge and skills relate to student learning. Set within the context of a diverse district in the New York City Public Schools, this professional development project engages a sample of kindergarten and 1st-grade teachers in a series of Saturday workshops. During the workshops teachers work individually and together to design and test new lesson plans that enhance teachers' abilities to help young children think and act like a scientist. Moreover, teachers work individually and together to construct lessons that connect science content to young learners' cultural backgrounds, interests and prior knowledge. This project is important intellectually because it adds to the knowledge base of how to engage young children in scientific inquiry. In practical terms, the project offers teachers a set of field-tested outcomes and products demonstrating how to effectively embed science-learning experiences into early childhood curriculum, instruction and assessment. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project uses an iterative process where teachers work on their own and collaboratively in Professional Learning Communities (PLC). Over the course of 2 years, these PLCs: (1) collaboratively design, field test and refine science-integrated lessons before implementing them in their classrooms; (2) participate in face-to-face and virtual meetings with other participating teachers and research project staff; and (3) receive mentoring and support to further reinforce their learning for NGSS teaching. Pre- and post-project measures will assess the professional development program's impact on 10 kindergarten and 10 first-grade teachers who serve a diverse array of 200 students in one of the nation's largest public school systems.  Specifically, the project will examine: (a) teachers' lesson plans; (b) implementation of their lessons in the classroom; (c) samples of student work; and (d) students' learning behaviors. Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to determine the project's anticipated outcomes which include: the characteristics of effective professional development for early childhood teachers; improved NGSS- based knowledge, skills and dispositions of kindergarten and first-grade teachers; and improved student science learning. In this way the project has the potential to catalyze new approaches to STEM learning, teaching and assessment at the early childhood level."

The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Employing a mixed-method approach, this project will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of the Scientific Explorers program. Additional research activities will include establishing the reliability and validity of a second grade science assessment. Approximately 40 second grade classrooms from two different geographical regions will participate in the project. Using multilevel modeling and item response theory techniques, this project will address five primary research questions: (1) To what extent can teachers feasibly implement the Scientific Explorers program in authentic education settings? (2) What is the impact of Scientific Explorers on the science achievement of students in participating classrooms? (3) Do early literacy skills at the beginning of second grade predict differential response to the Scientific Explorers program? (4) Does responsiveness to the Scientific Explorers program differ as a function of reading disability, mathematics disability, or a learning disability in reading and mathematics (comorbid LD)?, and (5) To what extent does the early science achievement measure demonstrate technical adequacy (reliability and validity)?"

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to integrate the use of computational approaches in K-12 STEM teaching and learning and understand how this integration can improve STEM learning, engagement, and persistence. Computational Thinking (CT) is a relatively new educational focus and a clear need for learners as a 21st century skill. This proposal tackles this challenging new area for young learners, an area greatly in need of research and learning materials. This project will develop integrated STEM and CT modules for grades 1-6 that follow new Massachusetts standards for Digital Literacy and Computer Science. They will partner with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE) for the development and implementation. There are almost no curriculum materials and accompanying assessments developed and tested for CT in this grade band. This development work alone would give the proposal potential for broader impact. However, a set of materials and accompanying Professional Development (PD) for teachers who will employ the materials of the quality that the authors propose has a tremendous potential for broader impact. This is improved by the strong partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for both development and implementation and the alignment with newly developed standards for Digital Literacy and Computer Science in Massachusetts. 100 teachers will participate in the PD. The set of modules will be used in the 1,154 elementary schools in Massachusetts immediately and they plan to disseminate further. The assessments the team will develop and share will enable many researchers to quickly improve their research in CT learning, as currently, there are no strong assessments available. The research plan will not only examine the effectiveness of the curriculum by examining both changes in student and teacher learning and attitudes towards CT, it will also investigate how the modules are implemented and deepen the field's understanding of what is effective STEM+C integration practices and of how teachers can best address the challenges that arise.<br/><br/>This project will develop, implement and test 18 integrated STEM and CT modules for grades 1-6 based on the new Massachusetts standards for Digital Literacy and Computer Science. They will partner with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for the development and implementation. Their first research question investigates how teachers teach with the materials and how to help teachers overcome obstacles in this area. They will use a combination of survey and Design Based research methodologies to address this question through activity feedback and summary logs for teachers for each module, notes from teacher professional learning community meetings, selected classroom field notes, and through developing and employing a fidelity of implementation measure. The second research question investigates the effects of the modules on student and teacher learning and attitudes of CT. The will develop and/or adapt a teacher survey and student CT assessments. The will use these in a comparison study with approximately 200 classrooms, half in a control condition and half in the treatment condition, resulting in approximately 2500 students per condition. In addition to the traditional dissemination methods of journal and conference publications and presentations, these modules and the associated assessments will immediately become part of Massachusetts elementary school curriculum, and will be available at no cost from the State of Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website."

In classrooms using MBER, modeling serves as an anchoring practice that keeps the inquiry tied to the goal of making sense of the world, helping teachers to engage their students in a range of cognitive and social activities that lead to deep understanding of scientific ideas. This project will generate rigorous causal evidence on how this approach to biology teaching and learning can support student learning, and foundational information on how to support high school teachers in improving their teaching. This funding will also provide resources to expand and update MBER to reflect the changing high school science landscape by integrating Earth Science standards into the year long sequence. The study will address the general research question: What is the impact of the Model Based Educational Resource (MBER) on high school students' science achievement, and what factors influence that impact? In addition to generating important research findings, the materials revised and studied in this project will be open-source and freely available to teachers and schools. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of instructional innovations.

This study addresses a significant gap in the research on next generation curriculum materials. While there is emerging agreement about the importance of instructional materials in supporting teachers in effectively engaging students in the practices of science, there is very little empirical evidence to support such claims. The goal of this project is to study the impact of the MBER program through a cluster randomized trial and expand the promise of efficacy and feasibility established in previous work. This study will be able to make causal claims by using an experimental design in which 32 high school teachers serve as their own controls, and by using multi-level modeling in the analysis.

Participants in the project will include students having learning, emotional, developmental, or physical disabilities who are eligible for special education services under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 2004, and their teachers.  During the three-year project, investigators will: a) Study the effects of project activities on participants' confidence, interests, and efficacy in STEM learning and occupations; b) Develop local STEM Teams that each include STEM and special education teachers, industry professionals, and transition specialists in four Oregon communities; c) Provide professional development opportunities and facilitate a process for the STEM teams to build capacity to create and implement action plans to increase STEM learning experiences for students with disabilities in their schools and communities; and d) Engage 160 students with disabilities in experiential learning and career exploration using online tools, school sponsored activities such as science fairs and robotics clubs, and community experiences such as field trips and job shadowing.  The project aims to improve employment outcomes for students with disabilities, and to advance knowledge of the contexts and conditions that influence their access to high school STEM learning pathways.  Special emphasis will be given to STEM fields related to regional economic initiatives and local community resources, including advanced manufacturing, agriculture, engineering, environmental sciences, health sciences, marine biology, and natural resources.<br/> <br/>The project will test an ecological model of community, school, and individual factors thought to influence participation and interests in STEM career pathways among students with disabilities.  During year one, the project will establish a Project Design Team and four STEM Teams--one for each of four different communities in Oregon--that will work with the project's research team to develop online career exploration content and tools using an existing Career Information System that is used in over 80% of Oregon school districts and across 16 other states. The project will develop and incorporate six new STEM and disability-specific tools: a) A STEM Crosswalk of Occupations component that identifies occupations that require STEM knowledge, but less than a four-year college degree; b) An Inverse Report for Career Assessment that identifies STEM-related occupations that correlate to a students' interests, skills, and values; c) Profiles of individuals with disabilities working in STEM-related fields; d) Lessons on disability awareness, disclosure, and accommodations; e) A Resources component to foster awareness of scholarships, summer internships, and other resources to help students with disabilities succeed; and f) An interactive  Postsecondary Transition Map that can be used to visually map and manipulate a postsecondary transition plan.  The model to be implemented and tested is grounded in the findings of previous projects focusing on the creation of career development resources and implementation of collaborative school-to-work transition programs.  Following a one-year development phase, the project will conduct a design experiment with 80 students with disabilities, making revisions as needed.  The project will conclude in year three with a pilot test of the revised model.  The revised model is expected to promote specific outcomes at three levels:  a) Increased STEM efficacy, participation, and interest in STEM careers among students; b) Increased knowledge and self-efficacy in STEM and disability content and STEM career awareness among teachers; and c) Increased capacity to provide STEM learning for students with disabilities among participating schools.  A design-based implementation research approach will be used to empirically design, develop, and test the program model using a variety of standard measures as pretests and posttests, a range of usage analytics, and custom reports to measure project progress and impact."

High school students will use videography to capture their conversations with undergraduate students about their academic struggles and successes in science. The goal is for the digital storytelling videos to bring to life the experiences students from underrepresented groups have in their pursuit of careers in STEM fields. The project is based on the premise that interactions between undergraduate students and high school proteges having similar backgrounds and social experiences have potential to benefit both students in the near peer mentoring relationship as well other high school students who view the videos within teacher-guided settings. The digital storytelling approach is expected to promote positive attitudes toward science, interests in science disciplines, and intentions to pursue education pathways to science-related careers. In particular, it is anticipated that the approach will contribute to broadening the participation of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM-related education pathways and career domains.  The project will examine the extent to which the planned creative and reflective video experiences generate interests in pathways to STEM careers more effectively than traditional, academically focused approaches. It is hypothesized that the digital storytelling videos highlighting core themes such as overcoming personal struggles and institutional barriers, learning from mistakes, dispelling misconceptions about scientists and science careers, and the reality of being a young person of color interested in science, can effectively promote positive attitudes toward science and intentions to pursue STEM-related careers.<br/><br/>This project is guided by four research questions: (1) For high school proteges co-constructing digital storytelling videos, does the project intervention influence students' possible future selves as well as the proximal outcomes of: (a) Positive attitudes toward science, (b) Greater interest in science, and (c) Greater intentions to pursue science pathways? (2) In a broader sample of high school students in science classrooms, does the project intervention succeed in influencing students' possible future selves and subsequent proximal outcomes? (3) What are the themes-both predicted and unanticipated-that are portrayed in the digital storytelling videos? What are the key elements that students find personally meaningful or memorable? (4) Do the intervention effects vary as a function of level of viewer engagement with the digital storytelling videos, specific themes portrayed in the videos, and/or individual student-level characteristics? And (5) Is the intervention feasible and usable in schools?  Does it show promise for scaling?  The project will begin with intervention design and recruitment of students and teachers, followed by a feasibility pilot test using a mixed-methods case study. An efficacy field test will then be conducted using a small-scale group-randomized design, with schools randomized into one of three conditions: full intervention, partial intervention without live video-chat, and partial intervention with informational videos rather than digital storytelling videos produced by participating students.  Outcome measures will be administered before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and six months after the intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective is to understand and evaluate the unique qualities of field stations as centers of informal and enduring science learning for the non-science community. There are over 400 field stations and represent a science communication mechanism that if available to most US citizens. This project is a collaboration between Texas A&M University and Colorado State University.<br/><br/>Field stations typically engage in informal science learning. While there are great examples of informal learning through outreach activities at field stations, little is known about what is happening in the aggregate at these establishments. This project documents the outreach work of field stations and explores the connections between how the outreach activities engage learners, incorporate science topics, and address science learning. By creating an Outreach Ontology, a multidimensional framework around the outreach activities, this work provides a valuable resource and reference to informal science researchers who seek to understand what informal learning projects are undertaken at field stations, and how these activities fit into the broader context of informal science learning. This project will help field stations collaborate on improving informal STEM learning activities by bringing them together to discuss their efforts and by developing a publicly available, searchable database detailing their activities. A particular benefit to advancing informal STEM learning by investigating field stations is the broad range of people and communities that are involved with and affected by field station outreach activities."

The project will design, develop, and test a research-based professional learning approach to help middle school science teachers effectively support and sustain student motivational competencies during science instruction.  The approach will include use of materials addressing student motivational processes and how to support them, evaluation tools to measure student motivational competencies, lesson planning tools, and instruments for teacher self-evaluation. The translation to practice will include recognition of student diversity and consider ways to facilitate context-specific integration of disciplinary and motivational knowledge in practice. The project will focus on middle school science classrooms because this period is an important motivational bridge between elementary and secondary science learning.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>SRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.<br/><br/>The study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade<br/>science teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum."

This exploratory project will assess the effectiveness of a Logic Programming (LP) approach to integrate computing into middle school science education. Researching LP as a strategy to integrate computing into STEM offers an interesting and viable approach for the STEM+C field. While LP is not a new programming approach, it is under-explored in the STEM+C field where the focus is more on visually-based programming such as block-based programming (e.g., Scratch). Through logic programming, students will learn to represent STEM subject-matter knowledge in an explicit and precise manner, while practicing critical thinking and logical reasoning, and developing computer models based on scientific investigation and problem-solving. A key advantage of LP is in its simplicity and generalizability, and this project will provide valuable information about its effectiveness for STEM content area curriculum development.  <br/><br/>Employing a design-based research methodology, the research team will first develop, test and implement 6-week modules that integrate computing with chemistry and life science using logic programming.  This curriculum will facilitate students in developing skills fundamental to computing (e.g., abstraction in knowledge representation) and STEM, and compliant with standards such as Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Science (TEKS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  A mixed-methods approach will be employed to study the effectiveness of the LP approach on students' motivation and learning outcomes in both computing and the STEM content areas.  The modules and supporting materials will be made available online, and promoted at conferences for practitioners and through workshops to non-participant teachers.

This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the characteristics of educational interventions after a humanitarian crisis that can foster positive adaptation. Students will gain a scientific understanding of the natural disaster that occurred and of the resilience of the local El Yunque rainforest. In addition, these investigations will provide a positive outlet for students to express their feelings in creative ways and propose design solutions for their local community.<br/><br/>For school age children on the island of Puerto Rico, the back-to-back hurricane strikes of Irma and Maria were their first experience with the tragedy of hurricanes in Puerto Rico. There is much concern in the media and associated reader comments about the ability of the forests in Puerto Rico to recover. These concerns reveal common misconceptions about the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Long-term research conducted by Luquillo ecologists paints a different picture. The El Yunque rainforest has adapted to being struck by hurricanes on a regular basis. Engaging in investigations of El Yunque resilience at different timescales and different perspectives allows students to connect their learning about the rainforest to the current tragedy of their everyday life. Students will propose designs for their local community for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria and preparation for future hurricanes by mimicking how nature recovers from hurricanes.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>SRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.<br/><br/>The study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade<br/>science teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum."

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new multidisciplinary approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning, and discipline-specific efforts in computing designed to build an evidence base for teaching and learning of computer science in K-12, including within diverse populations. Recent efforts have been made to incorporate computational modeling in physics instruction to facilitate integration of computing and physics instruction. However, these efforts focus on upper-grade, calculus-based physics courses, in which disproportionately fewer Black, Hispanic, and female students enroll. This project will develop and test an innovative professional development system where teachers develop physics, computing and CT, and pedagogical content knowledge that enables them to effectively incorporate computational modeling in algebra-based Physics First courses in which all students enroll. The project combines two complementary model-based pedagogies and tools - Modeling Instruction and Bootstrap - as the basis of an explicit instructional approach to teaching computing and CT and of curricular materials that are suitable for diverse early secondary learners of physics. The intervention will address specific needs of teachers and students with regard to relevant disciplinary content, practices, and computation as specified in the Next Generation Science Standards, the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, the Computer Science Teacher Association Computer Science Standards, and recent consensus frameworks for computational thinking in STEM. The project team includes physicists, education developers, and education researchers affiliated with the American Association of Physics Teachers and computer scientists from Brown University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Sixty teachers and their estimated 6000 students from high schools in New York and nationwide will participate in and benefit from the project. The diverse nature of the schools and the intentional design for algebra-based physics courses will both engage a demographically diverse student population in STEM and help the project achieve significant broader impacts, by assuring that the findings and products developed reflect the needs of a broad diversity of people and places. The project will contribute to practical models of professional development that support teachers' learning and integration of CT in physics, and possibly, other science domains. The project will produce professional development workshops and associated materials, including grade-level computational physics modules for a variety of core physics topics. The developed products and the research findings will be shared with more than 8,000 high school, community college, and 4-year college members of the Modeling and Bootstrap practitioner communities.  <br/><br/>This project will investigate a method of broadening access to CT through the integration of computational modeling in a context experienced by all students in participating teachers' schools: algebra-based physics courses. The professional development will engage teachers who are experienced users of Modeling Instruction in (1) a computational modeling course using the Bootstrap programming language and curricular resources; (2) a  scaffolded process for collaboratively developing instructional modules that integrate algebra-based physics and computational modeling; (3) ongoing support for implementing a core set of refined computational physics modules in algebra-based physics courses; and (4) monthly meetings of an online professional learning community to discuss the computational physics modules, their implementation, classroom successes and barriers, and evidence of CT-infused physics learning from student work. As a result of participating in the professional development, teachers will have increased facility with and disciplined application of computational modeling across a variety of core physics topics.  They will be able to support CT-infused physics learning as students build, refine, and use computational models to explore physical and computational worlds.  Over three years the project will engage 60 teachers from schools in New York and nationwide. Each year, two master teachers will partner with the project team to further refine the set of teacher-developed modules prior to implementation.  Quantitative and qualitative analysis of teacher and student assessments, surveys, interviews, work products, and both PD and classroom observations will be used to determine the effectiveness and broad utility of the approach for integrating physics and computing. The project will develop and validate a new Integrated Computational Thinking in Physics Survey (ICTPS) to measure (1) competencies with CT concepts and practices in the context of building computational models of physical systems and using them to solve problems; and (2)aspects of identity as a competent learner of computational thinking. The research will provide the first study of how professional learning with Modeling Instruction and Bootstrap pedagogies and resources augment teachers' learning of physics and CT and improves their competence and confidence to integrate computational modeling in physics curriculum and instruction. The research will also explore whether integrating computational modeling in algebra-based physics shows promise for improving diverse students' learning and problem solving in physics and computing. The new research assessment for measuring CT as applied to physical systems and problems may be broadly useful for future research at the intersections of physics and CT. The project team and advisory board members will disseminate findings to their respective professional associations and networks, including the American Association of Physics Teachers, American Modeling Teachers Association (AMTA), STEMteachersNYC, and stakeholders of the Bootstrap user community. Findings will also be shared by more traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. Efforts will be made to incorporate the computational physics modules produced in this study into the more than 80 Modeling Instruction workshops offered each year through the AMTA."

Despite the increasing ELL population and growing demands for STEM jobs, research has noted mounting disparities in ELLs' science achievement and their substantial underrepresentation in the STEM workforce. Addressing the growing disparities between ELLs and their counterparts in STEM fields remains a national priority. This CAREER project examines the empirical nexus between ELL students' language identity and science identity development. The project addresses the pressing need for empirical studies that combine theoretical perspectives from second language education, linguistics, and science education to understand science identity development among ELLs. Based on social positioning theory, the research argues that ELLs' disadvantaged positioning in their educational experiences (due to their limited language proficiencies) undermines their developing educational identities. The proposed research takes place at a STEM Summer Out-of-School (OST) Program in a university setting in Southern Massachusetts. The project includes ELL middle school students, who come from ethnically/racially, linguistically diverse and a low-income urban educational context from Gateway cities in Southern Massachusetts. NSF's CAREER Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations. <br/><br/>Using longitudinal mixed-methods and experimental research design, the project's central hypothesis is that interventions that support boosting ELLs' language identities, such as positioning them as cognitively advantaged, will positively interact with ELLs' learning and identifying with science, namely their science identities. The research will generate understandings about the role language-based perceptions have in ELLs' language identities, and more specifically, will measure the impact of advantaged positioning on ELLs' science identity development over time. Further, the project will formulate new and innovative methods teachers can use to recognize and promote competent science performance and language identity development among ELLs. Results will help educators, policy-makers, and researchers design effective instructional programs that support long-term educational achievement and identity development among ELLs. This project is funded by the Division of Research on Learning's Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by PreK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of STEM education innovations and approaches."

For example, teachers who have expertise working with students in the upper elementary grades might find themselves responsible for teaching first grade or kindergarten. Or, teachers with expertise in one area of science might find themselves responsible for teaching content in a different area (e.g., a teacher who is certified in biology might find herself responsible for teaching chemistry). Certification policies, the Next Generation Science Standards, and the creation of interdisciplinary STEM classes and schools will potentially result in more teachers being assigned out-of-field science teaching responsibilities. <br/><br/>Thirty participants--including educational researchers, science teacher educators, policy makers and elementary and secondary science teachers--will explore three questions: (1) What is the magnitude and variation of out-of-field science teaching in elementary and secondary science settings? (2) How do K-12 science teachers arrive at and negotiate out-of-field science teaching assignments? (3) What are the implications of out-of-field science teaching for those involved in science teacher preparation and professional development? The conference is unique in that it focuses on science teachers, addresses educational policy requirements; and looks at the spectrum of OOF teaching in science across the elementary, middle level, and high school grades. One potential outcome of the meeting is the establishment of a research agenda regarding out-of-field science teaching. Ultimately, the activities leading up to the conference, the conference, and the post-conference will allow for an understanding of the scope of out-of-field science teaching and science teachers' experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation's CAREER program supports junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. This CAREER project dissects and characterizes science explanations in formal and informal learning settings to uncover best practices for optimizing explanations. Developing optimal practices for how adults use explanations in science learning has potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge transfer to the next generation of science learners. For example, in science learning it is often accepted that children learn best when they acquire information from first-hand experience. However, many times, at both home and school, first-hand information is not available. In these cases, students rely on an explanation given to them by a caregiver or teacher. How adults choose to provide explanations can vary dramatically, and aspects of the explanation itself can drive variability in future learning. Yet, it is unclear how various aspects of an explanation can be optimized to enhance science learning. <br/><br/>The project employs a three-pronged approach that includes (1) observations of questions and explanations in adult-child interaction in an inquiry-based preschool, (2) systematic experiments in both laboratory and museum settings to explore how various aspects of an explanation impact children's learning, and (3) an intervention designed to promote scientific thinking in parent-child dyads in a museum setting. The results from this project will provide insight into how children use adult explanations in science inquiry. The work will also produce generalizable insights, distributed widely, into how to leverage adult explanations to encourage STEM learning. In doing so, the project addresses the need to develop innovative strategies for inspiring STEM inquiry before children enter formal schooling. More generally, insight into how explanations are used in inquiry-based learning will have broad impact for guidelines on how to teach science in formal and informal learning environments. Integrated with this research are several educational activities designed to promote broader public awareness of social interaction in children's STEM learning. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation."

Because of their widespread local presence in communities and the diverse communities served, libraries are well-positioned to address inequalities in access to technology, family programming, and spaces for collaboration. Science centers, universities, and community centers represent resources that can partner with libraries to create science and technology-related content for delivery to diverse communities. Research has firmly established the link between parent engagement and a broad range of student academic outcomes, including higher student attendance, achievement and graduation rates.  A growing body of research in out-of-school science learning is focusing on the rich and varied ways in which families learn science outside of school, including habits of mind, motivation, and identities as scientists. Pilot work showed that backpacks have the potential for youth and parents to take on new roles relative to STEM work, with parents or older siblings taking on roles of lab partners, translators, and even teachers. The Robotics and E-Textiles project will support increased capacity within libraries and community centers to hold robotics workshops for families in their own communities.  Libraries and community centers will serve as vehicles through which families engage with robotics and e-textiles, resulting in wider access to Next Generation Science Standards' engineering practices to more people. This Innovations in Development project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>Librarians and community engagement leaders will participate in professional experiences to develop science and technology content and facilitation skills. University researchers in collaboration with project partners will use a design-based research methodology to iteratively design the professional development and backpack programs and to investigate learning processes and outcomes. The Cultural Learning Pathways theoretical model will guide the study of how engagement with robotics/e-textiles experiences can lead to changes in practice, identity, and deeper participation in communities of practice on the part of librarians, youth, and families. <br/><br/>Although collaborations between public libraries and informal science providers are becoming increasingly common, this project will document the process of developing such collaborations and draw insights that may be applied to other contexts. By bringing together traditional and non-traditional community organizations to develop and facilitate STEM learning experiences, this project has the potential for resulting in a new model for a decentralized system of informal STEM education and broadening participation in STEM. Over the life of the project, the number of partner libraries will expand from one to four, and it is anticipated to reach more than 550 families.

This study is significant since the NGSS depend on local discretion in operationalizing foundational ideals in classroom instruction, yet few systems and schools are organized to support teachers in doing so. As such, this  project will address the need for additional knowledge and experiences for teachers to effectively implement the NGSS. In addition, it will develop and test a practical theory of organization and management detailing key domains of work that are essential to bridging academic standards to classroom instruction. It will construct models of effective, system-level and school-level science learning environments to enact this theoretical framework. The project serves the national interest by characterizing what makes school systems and schools effective in supporting fundamental change in teaching and learning such as NGSS, which will allow others to build on these insights, thus supporting the development of more effective school experiences with STEM for all students.  <br/><br/>The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Using a descriptive, theory-building longitudinal research approach, the project will investigate how systems and schools are responding to NGSS through a series of five studies. The program of research will target 12 school districts and 24 elementary schools in 3 states that are currently implementing NGSS. A comparative case study design across the five studies will feature cross-disciplinary collaboration among researchers with complementary expertise in studying systems, schools, and state level instructional improvement. This approach will advance knowledge of educational policy, system and school improvement, and instructional improvement by addressing a fundamental challenge of contemporary education reform: the coordination of national and state academic standards with teaching and learning in classrooms. Outcomes from this research will make contributions to broader social progress through support for schools and systems in ensuring excellence and equity in educational opportunities offered to students. These outcomes will also develop a practical theory of organization and management which, in turn, will increase the potential for directly guiding improvements in science learning, teaching, and outcomes at scale in larger numbers of schools.

ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.  This research in disabilities education project will contribute to foundational knowledge about how deaf and hard-of-hearing undergraduate students, and their hearing peers, work together within science teams to solve problems.  This research will contribute to the need to determine how to better educate students studying science in our country and about how they use their knowledge about statistics to solve problems. There are approximately 80,000 school-age children with hearing impairments in our nation's schools. There is a pressing need to ensure that when these students pursue college education, and advance in STEM careers, they have equal access to team work in science and mathematics education. Gaining a better understanding of how undergraduate students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing learn in team settings, and when they apply statistical knowledge to the science learning activities, has the potential to lead to further basic and applied research which may ultimately improve how these students learn science and how college faculty can improve their instructional practices to help students better learn science content, apply statistical knowledge to learning, and work together in STEM teams.<br/><br/>Project leaders at Rochester Institute of Technology's National Institute for the Deaf will investigate the effects of collaboration situation parameters (information, knowledge uncertainty, team member characteristics and technology) and schema enriched communication (training about communication and use of information boards for knowledge products) on the knowledge building processes (knowledge transfer, objects and interoperability, and cognitive congruence) evident in small groups of undergraduate students who apply statistics concepts to science problem solving.  At the completion of the exploratory study, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied educational research about how undergraduate teams, with deaf and hard-of-hearing members, solve science problems when they apply statistical knowledge. The results of this work are expected to be shared with education researchers and the public in professional publications."

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new multidisciplinary approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning, and discipline-specific efforts in computing designed to build an evidence base for teaching and learning of computer science in K-12, including within diverse populations. Integrating CT into core science instruction addresses practical constraints in K-12 education, in that there is no room in the curriculum to teach it directly to everyone. But, more importantly, integrating CT into core science provides a synergistic opportunity to deepen instruction in both. This project investigates the synergistic learning of physics and CT concepts and practices through students' construction of and interaction with computational models that visually represent physical systems.  Led by investigators at Vanderbilt University, the project team includes computer scientists, physicists, education developers, and learning scientists SRI International, Stanford, and Salem State University. The project will develop, implement, and study an innovative programming environment, a multi-week computational physics curriculum, and new assessments that are focused on physics concepts of force and motion and CT practices involved in computational modeling. Guided by the programming environment and the curriculum, learners construct models that represent physical systems, analyze and explain model behaviors, and then use models for solving problems. These processes support their abilities to think and act like a scientist as they explore and learn about both the computational and physical systems and phenomena. Assessments will be developed to measure CT-infused physics learning that is targeted in the curriculum, but also what CT learners apply to new physics topics and problem-solving situations they encounter. The educational program will address specific needs of high school students and teachers with regard to relevant disciplinary content, practices, and computation as specified in Next Generation Science Standards, the AP Computer Science Principles, and recent consensus frameworks for computational thinking in STEM. Approximately 450 students will be involved with and benefit from the project in four diverse high school settings. The diverse nature of the participating schools will both engage a demographically diverse student population in STEM and help the project achieve significant broader impacts, by assuring that the findings and products developed reflect the needs of a broad diversity of people and places. The project will develop new educational technologies, curriculum materials, and assessments for integrating physics and computation that will be broadly usable in high school physics and computer science courses.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a method of broadening access to CT through the integration of computational modeling and problem solving in secondary physics courses.  Through constructing computational models that represent complex physical systems, students will learn key concepts of Newtonian physics and CT practices of problem representation, abstraction, decomposition, composition, and verification.  The project will produce a new programming environment that is optimized for modeling physics systems and phenomena, that facilitates collaborative modeling and problem solving, and that diagnoses and responds to users' learning activity with adaptive scaffolds. Three standards-aligned, problem-oriented computational physics units will be developed and used in conjunction with the programming environment. Evidence-centered design will be used to develop and validate assessments that measure CT-infused physics learning that is targeted in the units. A unique set of assessments will be developed independent of the modeling environment to measure whether and what CT students spontaneously transfer to new physics problems and learning situations. The curriculum and assessments with be co-developed by researchers and four teachers from diverse high school settings in Tennessee and California. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of student assessments, surveys, work products, computer-use logs, and videotaped tasks will be used to determine the effectiveness and broad utility of the approach - and its component parts - for integrating physics and computing. By tackling the challenge to align offline and online measures of students' learning and behaviors, the project will generate deeper understanding of how students learn, the difficulties they face, and the promise of adaptive scaffolds for improving learning. The research will also elucidate the potential of explicit CT frameworks for preparing students' for future physics learning and problem solving. The project will provide the field with a strong foundation for designing learning technologies that integrate science and computational modeling. The research findings will be shared with the project team members' respective communities in computer science, technology education, cyberlearning, physics education, science education, and teacher education through papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. Efforts will be made to disseminate to teachers through practitioners workshops, conferences, and journals. A post-doctoral fellow and three graduate students will be trained through this project."

A large proportion of children are educated in rural school districts, in which district administrators may be challenged both to recruit and retain high quality teachers and to provide appropriate professional development for teachers. The interest and motivation for this project emerged from the rural school districts themselves, enhancing their stake in the future of their students, as opposed to imposing outside solutions. The project builds on the trust and relationships engendered by an existing Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to enable middle school students to benefit from the integration of specific computer science and computational skills into specific classes (art and music). The RPP will have the following objectives: (a) prepare and academically equip principals to lead the project, (b) prepare and academically equip teachers to integrate computer science and computational thinking into their subject content, (c) engage students in understanding the salience of computer science and computational thinking to their lives and careers, and (d) engage parents and caregivers in validating and sustaining the project. In order to attain these objectives, (a) principals will engage, on an approximately monthly basis, with ongoing professional development throughout the three years of the project that includes education, supervised practice, peer mentoring, and yearly 360-degree feedback on their learning-centered leadership, (b) teachers will similarly engage with ongoing professional development (both face-to-face and through completion of a massively open online course) and on-demand/continual instructional coaching throughout the school year, in addition to participating in approximately monthly ongoing guided peer review processes, (c) students' understanding of computer science and computational thinking will be solicited and reviewed on a regular ongoing basis, and (d) parents and caregivers will be empowered through Community Learning Exchanges to share with teachers and students the ways in which they utilize computer science and computational thinking on an ongoing basis. <br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge of how to introduce an educational innovation in rural school districts. Through a combination of ongoing education of principals, teachers, and parents, the project team will research and develop an approach to enhancing students' understanding of the salience of computer science and computational thinking to their lives and careers. The project will explore the overarching research question: To what extent can Computational Thinking (CT) and Computer Science (CS)  principles be integrated by teachers and learned by students in non-core subject areas such as art and music? The project will assess students' understanding of CT/CS, conduct instructional rounds and tuning protocols with teachers to assess the teachers' implementation and effectiveness, assess principals' learning-centered leadership, and assess the perceptions of all students, teachers, principals, and parents/caregivers on the efficacy of the program using Q-methodology."

The conference will bring together 35 participants, including physical and life science educators, education researchers, and computer science educators as well as representatives from other disciplines who have worked on integrating computational thinking in their secondary school disciplinary courses and who have practical experience with the challenges and opportunities afforded by computational education and the critical competencies and skills needed to prepare students in future computational science careers. The conference will develop a set of open research questions whose answers will provide evidence for the effectiveness of computational thinking integration and to articulate the common features of the computational thinking skills and competencies developed by the computer science professional community and by the physics, physical sciences, and computer science education communities. Having students develop computational thinking competencies will have a major influence on college and career readiness and the enhancement of the nation's computational workforce. The results of the conference will provide advice to secondary school educators about how to develop STEM and computer science education programs that foster the development of computational thinking for students, potentially affecting millions of students across the nation. This project is in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letter, DRK12: Advancing STEM + Computing (17-149) and is supported by the STEM + Computing Program that advances research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>Computational thinking includes the use of computational skills and methods to articulate and solve essential problems in a range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and to aid in developing a deeper understanding of core disciplinary ideas and crosscutting concepts to solve problems that will benefit society. The conference participants will identify similarities and differences among definitions of computational thinking and formulate a series of education research questions focusing on scaffolding computational thinking development in students (with an emphasis on secondary school physics and physical science students), professional development for teachers and faculty members, and assessing the effectiveness of various strategies in enhancing students' skills in computational thinking. The research questions will also address how computational thinking enhances students' understanding of the physics and physical sciences disciplines. Topics will include the vertical alignment of secondary STEM curricula that integrate computational thinking, appropriate learning progressions, standards, and assessment of the effectiveness of the curricula in fostering computational thinking and deepening the understanding of STEM content. The participants will also discuss how to develop a STEM + computer science education culture that fosters the pervasive implementation of computational thinking that has broad application to students. The project will make use of existing secondary school frameworks for computational thinking as articulated by elements of the 2012 Framework for K-12 Science Education and the 2017 CSK12 Framework at the secondary level, similar frameworks at the higher education level, and the early results of education research into integrated computational thinking in several NSF-funded projects.

Computing and computational thinking are a central component of all STEM disciplines and a core 21st Century skill necessary for students' success in our global economy. The critical need for more robust and equitable pathways into high employability STEM and Computer Science (CS) fields is well-documented. This project expands and diversifies the college and career pipeline for high school students, particularly underrepresented students, by expanding access to the essential STEM and computing knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. Building on an evidence-based digital learning model, EdAdvance and interdisciplinary partners in secondary education, higher education, and industry, will design, pilot test, and evaluate a series of CS courses that concurrently develop students' STEM and CS competencies. Newly developed digital CS learning modules will be integrated into a sequence of core required high school science coursework (Biology21, Chemistry21, and Earth & Energy Essentials). This approach maximizes student engagement in rigorous computational learning across a concentrated course of STEM studies and facilitates national replication and scaling. <br/><br/>Aligned with the new coursework, over 1,200 students in 12 diverse school settings (urban, rural, and suburban) will collaborate in student-led teams to develop innovation challenge projects (ICPs) that present solutions to real world STEM and CS challenges. Students form product or service development teams and collaboratively establish their business or non-profit structure for ICP development. Student teams will present their ICPs at the nationally-acclaimed Student Innovation Expo, competitively judged by a panel of STEM and CS industry and higher education experts. For instructors, a comprehensive professional development model, including a Summer Institute, instructional coaching, and professional learning communities, prepares educators to implement the curricula with fidelity and advance their STEM and CS content knowledge and pedagogy skills. Resources developed over the three-year project period will be published under an Open Education Resources license and disseminated statewide with the support of the Connecticut State Department of Education, the Connecticut Regional Educational Service Center Alliance, and the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, and nationally through partner networks. Researchers will examine the impact of this coursework on students': 1) STEM and computing self-efficacy; 2) STEM and CS career and education interest; 3) computing skills; and 4) 21st century inquiry skills. Formative assessment results and yearly analyses of the outcomes and fidelity of implementation will be used to design, develop, and test the coursework iteratively. Results of this research will inform the approaches and conditions that support the integration of computing skills into core high school science content, and will contribute to research on effective pedagogy and pedagogical environments to achieve equitable STEM and CS learning for all students."

Building on a prior partnership, this STEM-C Partnership's Computer Science Education Expansion project will permanently increase and enhance computer science learning opportunities for 9th and 10th grade students in the Rapid City, South Dakota, area.  Over a three-year period, this Partnership will support twenty-four current teachers in offering the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course.  This Partnership is led by two core Partners, the Black Hills State University and the Rapid City Area Schools, which serve the most pre-service teachers and the most off-reservation Native American K-12 students in South Dakota, respectively.  Additional Partners include most of the districts in the Rapid City region, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Technology and Innovation in Education, and the Sanford Underground Research Facility, a major scientific research lab in the region.<br/><br/>In addition to establishing the Exploring Computer Science Course at Rapid City Area Schools and neighboring school districts, this Partnership will build strong capacity within K-12 teachers to implement the course well.  It will also build linkages among teacher training institutions, local science facilities, K-12 districts, and a regional science and technology university. The project will conduct teacher training activities both on-site and at workshops, and will provide a variety of outreach trainings designed to encourage teachers, administrators, and youth too young to take the ECS course to become excited about the possibilities within computer science. In addition, the project will contribute research findings to the field of computer science education about the teaching and learning of computer science at the high school level. The educational research agenda will address the extent to and ways in which participation in the ECS course influences students' attitudes and beliefs about the nature of computer science, its importance, and its relevance to their lives; and their content knowledge of computer science and related problem-solving skills.  Research will also explore the extent to and ways in which teacher participation in the EPCS Project increases teachers' capacity to provide high-quality instruction.  Together, the Partners build on the success of a prior Math and Science Partnership project focused on mathematics education, including ways of developing new instructional materials, the introduction and development of a team of instructional coaches, training opportunities for administrators, and family engagement. Research instruments will be developed to measure students' attitudes and beliefs about the nature of computer science, its importance, and relevance to daily life.

This project will contribute to that effort by integrating computer science and computational thinking with science and mathematics coursework in a teacher preparation program for elementary and middle school teachers of science and mathematics.  This curriculum integration will be accomplished through two initiatives: 1) incorporating computing and computational thinking into mathematics and science courses for pre-service elementary and middle grades teachers; and 2) developing two new courses required for teacher licensure: An introductory computer science course that will focus on using a variety of technologies combined with computational thinking and coding to teach science and mathematics concepts, and a capstone course where students will develop a project using computational thinking concepts concepts from previous courses.  The goal is to enable pre-service teachers to later incorporate computational thinking, coding, and use of various technologies into their own teaching of science and mathematics in grades 1-8.  The Science and Engineering Practices described in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) include ""using mathematics and computational thinking"" as one of the eight practices that are essential for students to learn, and this project will enable new teachers to facilitate that learning.  The biology, physics, and mathematics courses in this teacher preparation program are part of an interdisciplinary undergraduate bridge program linking a community college to a university.  An important aim of the partnership is to recruit diverse minority, non-traditional, and other underrepresented student groups whose backgrounds mirror those of the urban students they will be teaching. This program is additionally well aligned with the priorities of the White House Computer Science For All initiative, and has the potential to influence teacher preparation programs nationwide.<br/><br/>This design and development project will modify both the curriculum and the classroom learning environments of a teacher preparation program for elementary and middle school teachers. Computational thinking will be integrated into five existing courses for pre-service teachers: biology, physics, algebra, geometry and a science teaching methods course. Two new courses will be developed for the teacher preparation program: An introductory computer science course and a capstone course that will increase engagement with computational thinking by providing a coherent sequence of learning opportunities, with pre-service teachers learning the basic concepts of computational thinking and coding in the introductory course, learning various applications in the disciplinary courses, and applying what has been learned in a capstone experience where students will develop their own projects with educational applications. The classroom environments for all the courses in the teacher preparation program will be modified by including use of the same technologies, coding procedures, and computational thinking concepts introduced during the initial computer science course.  The basic tools that will be used throughout the program include robots built using Lego Mindstorm kits during the initial computer science course, the Scratch programming language, and various Android applications that will be used on tablet devices in each course.  During that development process, the project will seek answers to two research questions: 1) What strategies for teacher preparation in computational thinking and coding are most effective for teachers and students from diverse backgrounds, and 2) How can we best use different technologies to help visualize mathematical and scientific concepts?"

The STEM+C (STEM + Computing Partnerships) program has as its goal the integration of computation and science. This project seeks new and innovative avenues to empower the learners with science and computation as one integral unit. Prior work on Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDTs) showed statistically significant improvement for under-represented students. The original focus was on simulations of cultural arts and helping students discover ""heritage algorithms"" for new virtual designs. Now, the investigators wish to expand CSDTs to include computational activities into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and other social motivations such as civic engagement and environmental concepts. CSDTs has now been simplified which allows students use of a programming platform to explore culturally-based STEM topics and share their code through an online user community. The students will learn how to program and apply their ideas to computational aspects of culturally relevant science tasks.<br/><br/>The primary activities will be carried out at Albany high school in New York with 2,214 students, 70% of whom are Black and Latino. Twenty undergraduates from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Engineering and Science Ambassadors program will be paired with 10 teachers who teach two sections of the same STEM+C course each day. This creates a comparison research study wherein the experimental and control groups are reasonably well-matched and can be evaluated with confidence. Thus, a total of about 500 students will be engaged annually. Secondary activities will use after school and summer learning programs for broader dissemination through the 4th Family that is a nonprofit organization reaching students at Schenectady High, Troy High, and Green Tech Charter High. Further, it engages these high school students in peer to peer outreach to middle and elementary schools as well as community accessible events such as the New York State Black and Latino Youth Summit. In the last 3 years, this group has reached a total of about 2,000 students. If the culturally sensitive hypothesis is supported by this research study, learning modules that are ""networked"" across other disciplines to enhance social relevance will show higher rates of propagation, more sophisticated computational thinking, and better correlation with independent measures of STEM engagement and performance among underrepresented students than learning modules that lack relevant attributes."

The project centers on a research expedition into the Arctic's Northwest Passage, which will engage intergenerational cohorts of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in hands-on research aboard the U.S. tall ship SSV Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP).  During the expedition, a professional film crew will produce a two-hour documentary focused on the NPP's innovative model of interdisciplinary informal STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning and highlight the expedition's research, participants, and the sociological issues related to the changing Arctic environment.  Because the Canadian Arctic is remote and costly to access, the project will maximize NSF's investment by giving broad audiences access to the science and excitement of the expedition through the documentary.  In addition, this informal science learning opportunity will not only engage students with scientists in authentic research, but also train the students to deliver daily live broadcasts from sea to three well-established U.S. informal science education institutions: the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), the Exploratorium, and the Alaska Sea Life Center (ASLC). The daily broadcasts will also reach the public in real time via the project's interactive website, providing the opportunity for people to post questions to the scientists and students onboard the ship. The NPP has great potential to benefit society by enhancing awareness of the changing Arctic's ecosystems and increasing science literacy. The hands-on research experiences will enhance the college readiness of the participating high school students and encourage the undergraduate students from the six partner MSIs to consider a graduate course of study and/or pursue STEM careers. The graduate students will also be more career-ready, as they gain public communication and leadership skills necessary for 21st century scientists. <br/><br/>The Northwest Passage Project is designed to advance knowledge and understanding within the practice of informal science education, as well as in the field of Arctic science. The project goals include: increasing public awareness and understanding of the changing Arctic ecosystem; increase public understanding about Arctic research and the scientific process; increase the Informal Science Education (ISE) field's understanding of the public's learning process when engaged in live interactions with scientists and student 'science communicators'; increase the ISE field's understanding of the value of immersive science experiences and impact on students from underserved and underrepresented populations; and to build or extend the capacity of ISE institutions to make connections between polar scientists, students, journalists and the public.  The NPP is creative in that it combines the engagement of students in field-based scientific research, live broadcasts from sea to ISE institutions, and the production of a full-scale documentary for public audiences.  A potentially transformative component to the ISE activities involves six Minority Serving Institution partners--Florida International University; University of Illinois, Chicago; California State University, Channel Islands; Texas State University; Virginia Commonwealth University and City College of New York--whose students will have the opportunity for a life-changing experience that may tip the scale toward their interest in STEM careers.  Each of these students will develop news stories, host screenings of the film at their respective campuses, and share their experiences with peers, providing visual role models for other underrepresented students, who may never have thought themselves capable of becoming a scientist or science communicator.  An additional project goal is to enhance the capacity and infrastructure of the three ISE partner institutions so that they may receive live broadcasts from the Inner Space Center in the future, beyond the funding period of the project.  People, Places & Design Research will conduct the project's front-end and formative evaluation; MEM & Associates will conduct the summative evaluation. Some of the key evaluation questions will be: <br/>* Have ISE and MSI institution public visitors, who view either the live broadcasts or the documentary film (or both), become more aware of the changing Arctic ecosystem and the importance of scientific research in the Arctic?<br/>* What is the relative impact of the live broadcasts compared to the finished documentary, and the strengths and weakness of the respective media in translating the on-board experience?<br/>* Does a real environmental and social context for scientific evidence stimulate audiences to become more interested in the role of science/STEM? <br/>* Have students gained leadership skills and the ability to communicate science to their peers? <br/>* Have students increased their motivation and interest in pursuing STEM careers?<br/>This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

The general aim of this project is to expand understandings of how CT can be infused into all high school science courses by examining the needs teachers who want to implement computational science curriculum modules, and researchers who want to measure outcomes of student learning experiences in computational science curriculum modules. <br/><br/>This exploratory integration research project will be implemented in three phases (development, pilot, and field trial) and will conduct mixed-methods studies of curriculum adaptation, teacher preparation and support, and measurement of student instructional experiences and outcomes. Three research questions guide the activities of this project: (1) How can computational thinking be operationalized in high school science courses? (2) What do high school teachers need to understand and believe to promote computational thinking in their science courses and to teach science using computational thinking? And (3) How can computational thinking integrated into science instruction be rigorously measured? The development phase will span the first two years of the project, and will result in: (1) Development of four CT curriculum modules: two for high school biology courses and two for high school chemistry courses; and (2) Development of prototype instruments for measuring CT.  The Pilot phase, taking place in year two of the project, will involve four selected teachers who teach science (two biology teachers and two chemistry teachers) and the students in two of their classes each (approximately 200 students total). The Field Trial phase in year three of the project will include a residential institute for 12 participating teachers (six biology teachers and six chemistry teachers). The institute will prepare them to teach the modules. During the year, each participating teacher will enact the modules in two of their science classes, involving their students also as participants in the research (approximately 600). During implementation, project team members will provide guidance to teachers through webinars, user community interactions, and just-in-time support."

This is a collaborative effort among Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center, and the East St. Louis Christian Activity Center. <br/><br/>This project builds upon an extant research-based STEM program, Global Challenges and the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center's Stellar Girls curriculum. Working with underserved third and fourth grade girls from East St. Louis, IL, the project will select one, 40-student cohort, to progress through a two-year program. Support from a team of experienced educators and students will explore global science and societal challenges that require students to find solutions for real-world, global issues while applying STEM and computational skills. Participating girls will engage in this curriculum for 10-weeks, three hours per week, and academic sessions, for four sessions over the course of two years. The project fills a gap in the literature by advancing our understanding of integrated STEM and CT curriculum as a means to foster greater knowledge and interest in science, CT, and computer sciences among urban minority girls who do not receive computer science education in their schools. Iterative design cycles integrating the voices of the girls will reveal emerging design principles that may be applied in other CT-integration initiatives.

In most middle schools, learning is segregated by discipline - science is taught in one class, and engineering or computing are taught in another, if at all.  Yet today discovery and innovation are interdisciplinary and students need to use skills and practices from multiple subject areas to solve problems.  The Designing Biomimetic Robots project will develop and study an education program that integrates science, engineering, and computing by engaging students in biomimicry design challenges to support students in developing computational thinking and scientific reasoning, as well as engineering design practices, while practicing interdisciplinary problem solving skills. Students will study the natural world to learn how animals and plants accomplish different tasks and then engineer a robot that is inspired by what they learned.  For example, they may use what they learn about how different animals pick up objects to design a robot that can assist wheelchair-bound people in picking up dropped items.  In addition, the project will demonstrate how teachers can foster interdisciplinary learning, and can broaden participation in science, engineering and computing among middle school students in diverse settings.<br/><br/>The project will develop an innovative intervention to support the development of interdisciplinary STEM knowledge and practices through a series of biomimetic design challenges.  The program will include: a) a 4-week modular and flexible curriculum that integrates bio-inspired engineering design, robotics, and computer programming content and practices into middle school STEM classrooms, b) a teacher professional development program, and c) web resources to support integration of biomimetic robotics into middle schools.  The goal is for all participating students to develop knowledge, practices, and skills consistent with engineering and science standards, and computational thinking principles, and demonstrate an understanding that computing enhances STEM practice and knowledge development.  Participating teachers will learn how to enact interdisciplinary instruction through integrating STEM and computing, and how to create task structures and discursive practices that support the participation of all students.  The project will contribute to theory about interdisciplinary and participatory learning environments that can foster students' learning about the intersections of computation, engineering, and biomimicry.

This is also the point when science becomes more complex and there is increased need for content knowledge, mathematics capability, and computer or computational knowledge. Evidence suggests that youth who participate in original scientific research are more likely to enter and maintain a career in science as compared to students who do not have these experiences. We know young people get excited by space science. This project (STEM-ID) is informed by previous work in which high school students were introduced to scientific research and contributed to the search for pulsars. Students were able to develop the required science and math knowledge and computer skills that enabled them to successfully participate. STEM-ID builds on this previous work with two primary goals: the replication of the local program into a distributed program model and an investigation of the degree to which authentic research experiences build strong science identities and research self-efficacies. More specifically the project will support (a) significant geographic expansion to institutions situated in communities with diverse populations allowing substantial inclusion of under-served groups, (b) an online learning and discovery environment that will support the participation of youth throughout the country via online activities, and (c) opportunities for deeper participation in research and advancement within the research community. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>STEM-ID will serve 2000 high school youth and 200 high school teachers in afterschool clubs with support from 30 undergraduate and graduate students and 10 college/university faculty. Exploratory educational research will determine the broad mechanisms by which online activities and in-person and online peer-mentor teacher-scientist interactions influence science identity, self-efficacy, motivation, and career intentions, as well as a focused understanding of the mechanisms that influence patterns of participation. Youth will be monitored longitudinally through the first two years of college to provide an understanding of the long-term effects of out-of-class science enrichment programs on STEM career decisions. These studies will build an understanding of the best practices for enhancing STEM persistence in college through engagement in authentic STEM programs before youth get to college. In addition to the benefits of the education research, this program may lead participants to discover dozens of new pulsars. These pulsars will be used for fundamental advances such as for testing of general relativity, constraining neutron star masses, or detecting gravitational waves. The resulting survey will also be sensitive to transient signals such as sporadic pulsars and extragalactic bursts.<br/><br/>This project provides a potential model for youth from geographical disparate places to participate in authentic research experiences. For providers, it will offer a model for program delivery with lower costs. Findings will support greater understanding of the mechanisms for participation in STEM.

The research especially focuses on leveraging pre-existing knowledge, interests, and social structures to draw connections to computational thinking, and studying how this impacts participants' self-described identity, attitude, and engagement with computer science. The project also assesses a novel method for teaching computational thinking that has potential for broad applicability in a variety of social and creative hobbies. Participants will use and modify generative design software that creates quilt designs and, in doing so, learn how creative interests can be expanded through computer science. By focusing on the hobby of quilting, which is not typically associated with computer science, the knowledge built through designing and evaluating the research offers strategies for altering public perception of computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CS for All Springfield Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) proposes a four-year plan to integrate standards-based computer science and computation thinking (CS/CT) concepts, learning progressions, and practices in core curricula across all Springfield Massachusetts K-5 public schools. The Partnership's primary intended long-term outcomes are (1) to prepare a diverse student population, including English learners, students with disabilities, underserved race and ethnicities, and students experiencing poverty, ""to effectively use and create technology to solve complex problems"" that they need post-high school for college and career, and (2) to grow the expertise for CS/CT teaching and learning within the District. Springfield has the second largest public-school district in Massachusetts and includes 33 elementary and other schools that serve almost 12,000 K-5 students, staffed by more than 1,000 teachers. Reaching 1,000 teachers and 12,000 students is a significant challenge. ""Gateway"" cities, such as Springfield are important incubators of innovation. By focusing on K-5, the partnership has an opportunity to design curricula that includes all students in CS/CT teaching and learning and, if successful, create a sustainable model that will influence other, diverse, medium-to-large urban districts. The Partnership will develop an innovative, collaborative instructional support network for teachers implementing the new curricula pilots and district-wide implementation and provide professional development for teachers and school leaders on the fundamental concepts, standards, curricula, tools and pedagogy for computer science and computational thinking, and on evidence-based collective inquiry and improvement of practice. CS for All Springfield will enable teachers to gain the skills and confidence to create an effective and equitable learning environment, which will reach Springfield's large number of underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students and put them on a path that prepares them to use technology and computational thinking in middle school, high school, college and careers.<br/><br/>The established CS for All Springfield researcher-practitioner partnership of learning science, educational policy, social science and computer science researchers, experienced evaluators, teachers, school and district leaders, instructional and IT specialists, and curriculum coordinators will undertake an ambitious and innovative approach. The project will couple Design-Based Implementation Research; a series of agile, iterative and collaborative pilots and at-scale implementations informed by and informing research and evaluation; a strategy for using external and embedded professional development; and cross-school professional learning communities (PLC) linked with current school-based PLCs. The research questions will focus on the characteristics and challenges and opportunities in implementation of the dyadic PLC; changes in students' learning, interest, and skills; and the barriers to and opportunities for a successful CS for All implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will study the integration of computational thinking as part of a new and more contemporary perspective of STEM literacy, and will design, develop, and beta-test a prototype literacy assessment tool that will measure computational thinking literacy along with measures of literacy in other STEM content areas. The tool will be available to the general public as a self-measurement application (App) that can be used by individuals to test their own literacy, and by teachers, schools, and informal educators and organizations to assess literacy development in their students and in their STEM education programs.  This transdisciplinary research project will begin the process of creating an innovative approach and tool for measuring literacy that will expand the definition of literacy to include computational skills along with science reasoning. Literacy is an important concept and measurement that has traditionally been used to assess an individual's knowledge of science. This project will explore a broader literacy perspective that incorporates learning derived from out of school and one that incorporates computational skills and thinking as part of a more contemporary perspective of STEM literacy. A prototype web-based App allowing individuals and education organizations to assess literacy levels, and ways to enhance literacy, will be developed and studied. The methodology will be developed using discussions and knowledge from over 60 experts across computing, education, science, social science, and other STEM fields using a Delphi method to engage in reconceptualization of literacy. The hypothesis is that this new STEM+C literacy framework should be structured along four interacting but semi-independent domains: 1) general STEM+C knowledge; 2) self-defined areas of STEM+C knowledge and expertise; 3) attitudes and beliefs related to STEM+C; and 4) the skills and competencies necessary to participate in STEM+C related pursuits and discussions, including measures of modes of STEM+C thinking. Each of these four domains is likely to include numerous sub-domains and associated descriptors, which collectively describe the different aspects of being a STEM+C literate citizen. The application will be designed to provide feedback to individuals on their knowledge, attitudes and skills compared with those of others and suggest ways to enhance and improve their skills and understanding through an embedded feedback mechanism. This project creates public benefit by providing individuals and organizations with a responsive real-time understanding measuring STEM+C literacy, deepening the dialogue about the value of public engagement in science, engineering, technology, math and computing and revealing the dynamic factors that inform STEM+C literacy."

The project will develop and research storytelling as a culturally responsive way to engage middle school Native American and rural Montana students in learning computer science and computing skills. Instead of creating a new curriculum, the project will infuse computer science across the curriculum, which will help students understand that computing skills are relevant across disciplines and are important for a wide variety of professions in the workforce. The project will use Alice, an object-based educational programming environment, that has been successful by encouraging storytelling in engaging middle school students and others who are not normally exposed to programming. Using Alice, students can tell stories by placing objects in virtual worlds they have created, and then they can program by dragging and dropping tiles that represent logical structures.  By integrating these computational skills, without multiplying the number of topics to be taught, the project will promote a more diverse and comprehensive understanding of the opportunities available to students with an ability to think computationally. The project will develop resources for teachers to meet the requirements of Montana's Indian Education for All (IEFA) Act, which was mandated by the state legislature in 1999 and remains a difficult requirement for many middle school teachers to incorporate in their classrooms.  The project will serve over 300 students when piloting curriculum materials and will engage 50 teachers in professional development workshops on the integration of computer science and computational thinking across middle school curriculum using a storytelling approach.<br/><br/>The project will use a culturally responsive approach to infuse the use of storytelling (using Alice) in the curriculum, guided by Tribal Critical Theory (TribCrit), which maintains that cultural knowledge and academic knowledge are not mutually exclusive but complement each other.  The project tools, which will enable middle school teachers to integrate computer science and computational thinking throughout the curriculum, will be developed using a research-driven, iterative way to be culturally responsive to the communities served.  Project research will address two complementary research questions: (1) Do storytelling and storymaking serve as effective means for engaging middle-school students in computer science?; and (2) Does the integration of computing skills into the core middle-school curriculum increase instruction and student learning of these skills? In addition, the project will document the processes and evaluate the effectiveness of the TribCrit culturally responsive approach taken in integrating computer science and computational thinking into the middle school curriculum. A mixed-method approach will be used in the research, including focus groups, small group instructional diagnosis, surveys, and pre/post measures of computational thinking/computer science knowledge.  Project results will be disseminated through professional journals and conference presentations.  Selected student-created artifacts (i.e., Alice virtual worlds and stories) will be presented in Montana museums."

The project will fill a major gap in knowledge regarding why children listen to science podcasts and what impact they have on their STEM learning.  Brains On! is an existing podcast for children 6-12 years old that is produced by American Public Media.  The podcasts are kid-driven.  Kid listeners send in questions and suggest the show topics.  Every episode is co-hosted by a different child, who interviews top scientists about their work, sees research done first hand and helps shape the overall arc of the episode. The project team collaborates with a wide variety of scientists to create programming that is both appealing to kids and has scientific merit.  Although Brains On! has enjoyed more than 2.4 million downloads collectively of its 50-episode library little is known about why children are drawn to it, how they are using its content, and what the impacts might be for those who listen to the podcast. There has been no previous research to understand why children choose to listen, or what impact it has on their learning.  This Pathways project would produce new episodes and collaborate with the Science Museum of Minnesota that would conduct research to fill this large gap in understanding aural learning through podcasts.<br/><br/>The Brains On! project has the following goals to create strategic impact: 1) explore and begin to develop knowledge around what makes children's science podcasts, such as Brains On!, appealing and what role they can play in impacting children and their families' science curiosity, learning, and awareness of science careers, and 2) develop a theory of action for the Brains On! podcast that could also inform the development of similar kinds of children's science podcasts. A mixed-methods exploratory research study will be carried out to address these goals. The three overarching research questions are:  Who is the audience for Brains On! and what are their motivations for listening to science podcasts? How are Brains On! listeners using the podcast and engaging with its content?  What kinds of impacts does Brains On! have on its audiences?  The research results, including the theory of action, from the Brains On! exploratory study will benefit the fields of informal science education and public media by beginning to fill a gap in the current knowledge-base around the potential for science children's podcasts to contribute to a wide range of informal science learning outcomes for children and families, as well provide insight into what features of children's science podcasts can lead to those outcomes. The study results may also encourage other public media and informal science education organizations to create their own science podcasts for children, increasing the reach and potential impact of this emerging STEM media resource."

This is important since scientific knowledge is often seen as abstract and distant from the daily concerns of average citizens. A community focus shifts the spotlight away from individual learning to collective learning facilitated by trusted cultural institutions serving as social assets. This work brings together scientific expertise and community organizations to advance operational science literacy--scientific ways of problem-solving--for community leaders and functional science literacy--information and skills people can use in their daily lives--among their service populations. This will be done by gathering and sharing knowledge and developing skills and abilities to contribute to the community's overall well-being. <br/><br/>The New England Aquarium (NeAq) and Aquarium of the Pacific (AoP) will apply a community engagement model involving active listening, documentation, alignment of concerns and goals, and co-development of shared solutions that serves the needs of all participants. As part of the Advancing Community Science Literacy (ACSL) project, multi-disciplinary teams from NeAq, AoP and their regional partners will participate in training on the model. They will apply that training to build and implement action plans to advance community-driven responses to local environmental issues. Teams will be assessed with respect to how they use tools from their shared training, along with peer support and coaching, to make progress in engaging diverse community stakeholders. Results of the evaluation will offer insights and recommendations for informal science learning centers to serve their communities more effectively as engagement facilitators and change agents to support science literacy development and action. By applying techniques developed for cultural institutions to communicate about climate science, and combining those with techniques developed for libraries and other organizations to help meet emergent community concerns, such as storm surges and coastal flooding, it is possible to redefine the role informal science learning centers can play as part of a community culture. <br/><br/>ACSL is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which supports projects that provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advances innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and develops understandings of deeper learning by participants."

The purpose of this project is to test interventions that have the potential to ameliorate language as a barrier to science learning. To isolate the active ingredient, two separate interventions - one addressing grammar and the other addressing vocabulary - will be compared to a science only control condition. The participants will be preschoolers and kindergarteners who have specific language impairment (SLI), a prevalent condition that impedes the development of vocabulary and grammar. Early intervention could be key to preparing future secondary and post-secondary students with SLI for the successful acquisition of STEM knowledge and the pursuit of STEM careers. The project goals are intended to better understand how to improve these students' learning trajectories before significant gaps in scientific knowledge have developed. Integration of supports for science-relevant grammar and vocabulary into early science curricula may be a viable approach.<br/><br/>The research involves randomized controlled trial with assignment of participants to one of three intervention conditions: science only, science + vocabulary supports, and science + grammar supports. Small-group inquiry-based science instruction will occur in all three conditions. The science + vocabulary condition will include instruction on science-related vocabulary words whereas the science + grammar condition will include a focus on complex grammatical constructions relevant to scientific inquiry. Weekly measures during the intervention and withdrawal phases will target participants' mastery and maintenance of taught science concepts. Additional measures administered before and after the intervention phase will target participants' generalization to untaught science concepts and practices. Comparisons of  outcomes between conditions are intended to assess whether supports for vocabulary and grammar improve science learning.

Building upon research showing that teacher education is most effective when enacted in concert with highly aligned, practical learning of content in the pedagogical context, the MASTER partners are designing, implementing, refining, and testing a model of secondary science and mathematics candidate recruitment, teacher preparation, induction and professional development.  Moreover, the MASTER project is supporting three cohorts of 25 novice teachers and their mentors to serve in New Visions/NYC DOE schools, leading to the establishment of school communities that support collaborative pre-service teacher learning and ongoing teacher development.  Upon satisfactory completion of their first residency year, MASTER residents receive their initial New York State certification in Adolescence Education in Mathematics, Biology, Earth Science, or Chemistry; in year two, after successful coursework completion and demonstration of effective instruction, they earn their Hunter College master's degree.  The MASTER effort includes multiple approaches designed to develop teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in conjunction with training in inquiry-based instructional strategies in an effort to increase the effectiveness of novice science and mathematics teachers and their mentors in delivering high quality instruction to urban secondary students.  The project also impacts whole-school reform efforts through ongoing, aligned induction work with in-service teachers, and the production and dissemination of materials aligned to Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and Next Generation Science Standards.<br/><br/>MASTER bridges the divide between traditional, alternative and clinically based programs by creating a clinically-rich, carefully sequenced, formatively assessed model that is constantly being evaluated against concrete outcome measures of student learning.  As a comprehensive approach to building pre- and in-service teachers' PCK in order to increase student achievement, MASTER responds to the Math and Science Partnership program's call for innovations in the preparation of K-12 teachers of science, mathematics, engineering, and/or computer science at the pre-service level and support of new teachers during their early years in the profession.  To validate outcomes, and produce findings that others may incorporate in their own designs for teacher preparation, MASTER research and evaluation is focused on demonstrating that:<br/>     -  The PCK-focused residency and mentor training curricula created by partners with distinct and deep expertise will increase the likelihood that novice and experienced mathematics and science teachers develop effective and engaging practices.<br/>     -  Participating mentor teachers and their colleagues will develop as peer leaders and will share their learning across departments and schools, creating a shift in school-wide instructional culture.<br/>     -  Students in participating teachers' classrooms will engage in project-based learning with PCK-trained teachers across multiple years, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will deepen their science/mathematics learning and take more science classes as well as higher-level mathematics courses (beyond the New York City requirements for graduation)."

This project will bring together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and science teachers to identify a set of practices that science teachers can readily incorporate into their planning and instruction.  The project will design, develop, and test a research-based professional learning approach to help middle school science teachers effectively support and sustain student motivational competencies during science instruction.  The approach will include use of materials addressing student motivational processes and how to support them, evaluation tools to measure student motivational competencies, lesson planning tools, and instruments for teacher self-evaluation. The translation to practice will include recognition of student diversity and consider ways to facilitate context-specific integration of disciplinary and motivational knowledge in practice. The project will focus on middle school science classrooms because this period is an important motivational bridge between elementary and secondary science learning. This project will enhance understanding of teacher pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in that it frames knowledge about supporting motivational competencies in science as PCK rather than general pedagogical knowledge. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.   <br/><br/>This early stage design and development project will iteratively develop and study a model of teacher professional learning that will help middle school science teachers create, modify, and implement instruction that integrates support for students' motivational competencies with the science practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas specified in science curriculum standards.  A design-based research approach will be used to develop and test four resources teachers will use to explicitly include attention to student motivational competencies in their lesson planning efforts.  The resources will include: 1) educational materials about students' motivational processes with concrete examples of how to support them; 2) easy-to-implement student evaluation tools for teachers to gauge students' motivational competencies; 3) planning tools to incorporate motivational practices into science lesson planning; and 4) instruments for teacher self-evaluation. A collaborative group of educational researchers will partner with science teachers from multiple school districts having diverse student populations to jointly develop the professional learning approach and resources. This project will contribute to systemic change by moving motivational processes from an implicit element of educating students, to an explicit and intentional set of strategies teachers can enact.  Research questions will focus on how teachers respond to the newly developed professional learning model, and how students respond to instruction developed through implementing the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers will build the first co-creative learning companion, Cai, that will scaffold students with pedagogical strategies that include making use of learner code to illustrate abstraction and modularity, suggesting new code to scaffold new concepts, providing help and hints, and explaining its decisions. This work will directly address the national need to develop computing literacy as a core STEM skill.<br/><br/>The proposed work brings together an experienced interdisciplinary team to investigate the hypothesis that adding a co-creative learning companion to an expressive computer science learning environment will improve students' computer science learning (as measured by code sophistication and concept knowledge), positive attitudes towards computing (self-efficacy and motivation), and engagement (focused attention and involvement during learning). The iterative design and development of the co-creative learning companion will be based on studies of human collaboration in EarSketch classrooms, the findings in the co-creative literature and virtual agents research, and the researchers' observations of EarSketch use in classrooms. This work will address the following research questions: 1) What are the foundational pedagogical moves that a co-creative learning companion for expressive programming should perform?; 2) What educational strategies for a co-creative learning companion most effectively scaffold learning, favorable attitudes toward computing, and engagement?; and 3) In what ways does a co-creative learning companion in EarSketch increase computer science learning, engagement, and positive attitudes toward computer science when deployed within the sociocultural context of a high school classroom?

This is also the point when science becomes more complex and there is increased need for content knowledge, mathematics capability, and computer or computational knowledge. Evidence suggests that youth who participate in original scientific research are more likely to enter and maintain a career in science as compared to students who do not have these experiences. We know young people get excited by space science. This project (STEM-ID) is informed by previous work in which high school students were introduced to scientific research and contributed to the search for pulsars. Students were able to develop the required science and math knowledge and computer skills that enabled them to successfully participate. STEM-ID builds on this previous work with two primary goals: the replication of the local program into a distributed program model and an investigation of the degree to which authentic research experiences build strong science identities and research self-efficacies. More specifically the project will support (a) significant geographic expansion to institutions situated in communities with diverse populations allowing substantial inclusion of under-served groups, (b) an online learning and discovery environment that will support the participation of youth throughout the country via online activities, and (c) opportunities for deeper participation in research and advancement within the research community. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>STEM-ID will serve 2000 high school youth and 200 high school teachers in afterschool clubs with support from 30 undergraduate and graduate students and 10 college/university faculty. Exploratory educational research will determine the broad mechanisms by which online activities and in-person and online peer-mentor teacher-scientist interactions influence science identity, self-efficacy, motivation, and career intentions, as well as a focused understanding of the mechanisms that influence patterns of participation. Youth will be monitored longitudinally through the first two years of college to provide an understanding of the long-term effects of out-of-class science enrichment programs on STEM career decisions. These studies will build an understanding of the best practices for enhancing STEM persistence in college through engagement in authentic STEM programs before youth get to college. In addition to the benefits of the education research, this program may lead participants to discover dozens of new pulsars. These pulsars will be used for fundamental advances such as for testing of general relativity, constraining neutron star masses, or detecting gravitational waves. The resulting survey will also be sensitive to transient signals such as sporadic pulsars and extragalactic bursts.<br/><br/>This project provides a potential model for youth from geographical disparate places to participate in authentic research experiences. For providers, it will offer a model for program delivery with lower costs. Findings will support greater understanding of the mechanisms for participation in STEM.

The project is a collaboration of teachers in the Chicago Public Schools, science educators, chemists, and environmental scientists from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, Loyola University, and members of the Chicago Environmental Justice Network. The project is significant because it leverages existing partnerships and builds on pilot projects which will be informed by a corresponding cycle of research on teachers' learning and practice. The project will position Chicago teachers and students as Change Makers who are capable of addressing the crises of inequity in science education and environmental contamination that matter deeply to them, while simultaneously advancing their own understanding and expertise. The project will examine the malleable factors affecting the ability of teachers to engage underrepresented students in innovative urban citizen science projects with a focus on the synergistic learning that occurs as teachers, students, scientists, and community members work together on addressing complex socio-scientific issues. <br/><br/>The goal is to provide a network of intellectual and analytical support to high school chemistry teachers engaged in customizing curricula in response to urban environmental concerns. The project will use an annual summer institute where collaborators will develop curriculum and procedures for collecting soil and water samples. In the project, the teachers and students will work with university scientists to analyze these samples for heavy metals, and students will share their results in community settings. The study design will be multiple case and be used to study the content knowledge learned and mobilized by participating teachers as they develop these authentic projects. The project includes explicit focus on the professional development of high school science teachers while it also aims to create rich learning opportunities for underrepresented high school students in STEM fields. The contextualized science concepts within students' everyday experiences or socio-scientific issues will likely have a positive impact on student motivation and learning outcomes, but the experiences of urban students are less likely to be reflected by the curriculum, and the practices of effective secondary science teachers in these contexts are under-examined."

With the inclusion of mathematics expertise this project provides the resources to pursue ideas and issues in a timely manner across the full spectrum of STEM. Providing evidence-based strategies to address deficiencies in science or STEM education is one of the major contributions of projects in the BOSE portfolio. <br/><br/>In connecting NRC/BOSE to NSF/EHR, their complementary missions form a context for developing a jointly designed agenda for both investing in research on STEM education and for integrating the findings obtained by the research community. Combining the discovery process supported by NSF and the reflective, interpretive, independent work that can be conveyed in NRC reports and through the convening power of BOSE will advance the relevance and applicability of the national STEM education research agenda in significant ways. This proposal will help to shape the focus of that agenda through greater collaboration and interaction between the networks established by BOSE and the expert advice gathered by NSF through its review panels, regular conferences involving its PIs, and the expertise of its program officers.  <br/><br/>Results from the last 5-year grant were very productive. For examples, the reputation of BOSE for evidence-based, impartial guidance was instrumental in two recent projects that hold promise for transforming K-12 science education in the United States: A Framework for K-12 Science Education (the blueprint for the Next Generation Science Standards) and a two-report series on successful STEM education that lays out recommendations for improving STEM education and outlines a set of indicators that can be used to monitor progress toward these improvements: Successful K-12 STEM Education (2011), and Monitoring Successful K-12 STEM Education (2013).

To bring research on social psychology to public urban environments, the Street Smarts project will produce an outdoor learning installation in front of San Francisco City Hall that will serve the diverse audiences that frequent the area.  The outdoor space will be populated with exhibits that engage this public in social observation and participatory experiences, promoting learning about the science of social polarization, social dilemmas, and social norms. These exhibits will not only engage the public in third-person experience of social and behavioral sciences content, but also create first-person engagement and reflection as visitors come to examine their own participation in social dynamics. By adding exhibits and digital content to social gathering places, Street Smarts will frame and augment people's natural social curiosity with the perspectives and skills of social psychology researchers. In the process, visitors will acquire new social observation skills, reflect on their own perceptions and actions, empathize with others of different social identities, and increase their appreciation for how social behavior, emotion, and thought can be studied scientifically.  This project draws from a growing practice of creating informal learning spaces in public environments. A renaissance of urban design in the public interest led by groups such as the Project for Public Spaces, Gehl Design, and the Exploratorium's Studio for Public Spaces aims to create human-scaled, intentionally social, and increasingly educational gathering spaces in cities across the world.  The project will produce an online ""Guide to People Watching"" for the general public, with additional materials to support professionals in the creation of social science learning experiences.<br/><br/>Inquiry into social phenomena is not only critical to understanding psychological mechanisms and principles, but is of fundamental importance in maintaining a citizenry capable of meeting real life global challenges. The project will build on and extend informal learning research into social metacognition conducted by the Exploratorium and others. Street Smarts will produce new research on how to design experiences that prompt structured, quasi-scientific social observation skills and foster empathy for the social experience of others. The research will address three questions: (1) Are public exhibits about social phenomena more likely than public exhibits about physical phenomena to engage people in interactions with strangers, particularly those who appear different from themselves in societally important aspects?  (2) What types of social science exhibit designs for public spaces and the roles they promote most effectively promote social scientific thinking skills? And (3) What types of social science exhibit designs and the roles they promote foster empathy for people who appear to be different from one another? To answer these questions, a quasi-experimental research study will employ real-time observations, interviews, and surveys with 240 randomly-sampled individuals (80 in each treatment condition). By comparing physical science exhibits in the control condition to the social science exhibits in a treatment condition, the project will determine which type of exhibit phenomenon best promotes stranger interactions, holding user role constant. Comparing two treatment conditions will support an investigation of the effect of user role on social scientific thinking and empathy, holding type of exhibit phenomenon constant.  In all conditions, we will assess demographics and aspects of participant experience, including awareness of roles, level of social scientific thinking, and degree of empathy for other users. Analyses will include chi-square tests of independence and linear regressions to determine relationships between exhibit designs and user outcome variables. Through project development and research, Street Smarts will build new knowledge about how the public learns about and reflects on social phenomena as well as design strategies to facilitate that learning in public settings."

This project will contribute to the Earth science education community's understanding of how engaging students with dynamic computer-based systems models supports their learning of complex Earth science concepts regarding Earth's surface phenomena and sub-surface processes. It will also extend the field's understandings of how students develop modeling practices and how models are used to support scientific endeavors. This research will shed light on the role uncertainty plays when students use models to develop scientific arguments with model-based evidence. The GEODE project will directly involve over 4,000 students and 22 teachers from diverse school systems serving students from families with a variety of socioeconomic, cultural, and racial backgrounds. These students will engage with important geoscience concepts that underlie some of the most critical socio-scientific challenges facing humanity at this time. The GEODE project research will also seek to understand how teachers' practices need to change in order to take advantage of these sophisticated geodynamic modeling tools. The materials generated through design and development will be made available for free to all future learners, teachers, and researchers beyond the participants outlined in the project. <br/><br/>The GEODE project will develop and research the transformational potential of geodynamic models embedded in learning progression-informed online curricula modules for middle school teaching and learning of Earth science.

In 2015, while 57% of professional occupations in the U.S. were held by women, only 25% of computing occupations were held by women.  Furthermore, the share of computer science degrees going to women is smaller than any STEM field, even though technology careers are the most promising in terms of salaries and future growth.  Research suggests that issues contributing to this lack of computer science participation begin early and involve complex social and environmental factors, including girls' perception that they do not belong in computer science classes or careers.  Computer science instruction often alienates girls with irrelevant curriculum; non-collaborative pedagogies; a lack of opportunities to take risks or make mistakes; and a heavy reliance on lecture instead of hands-on, project-based learning.  Computer science experiences that employ research-based gender equitable best practices, particularly role modeling, can help diminish the gender gap in participation. In response to this challenge, Twin Cities PBS (TPT), the National Girls Collaborative (NGC) and Code.org will lead Code: SciGirls! Media for Engaging Girls in Computing Pathways, a three-year project designed to engage 8-13 year-old girls in coding through transmedia programming which inspires and prepares them for future computer science studies and career paths.  The project includes five new PBS SciGirls episodes featuring girls and female coding professionals using coding to solve real problems; a new interactive PBSKids.org game that allows children to develop coding skills; nationwide outreach programming, including professional development for informal educators and female coding professionals to facilitate activities for girls and families in diverse STEM learning environments; a research study that will advance understanding of how the transmedia components build girls' motivation to pursue additional coding experiences; and a third-party summative evaluation. <br/><br/>Code: SciGirls! will foster greater awareness of and engagement in computer science studies and career paths for girls.  The PBS SciGirls episodes will feature girls and female computer science professionals using coding to solve real-world challenges. The project's transmedia component will leverage the television content into the online space in which much of 21st century learning takes place.  The new interactive PBSKids.org game will use a narrative framework to help children develop coding skills.  Drawing on narrative transportation theory and character identification theory, TPT will commission two exploratory knowledge-building studies to investigate: To what extent and how do the narrative formats of the Code: SciGirls! online media affect girls' interest, beliefs, and behavioral intent towards coding and code-related careers?  The studies aim to advance understanding of how media builds girls' motivation to pursue computer science experiences, a skill set critical to building tomorrow's workforce. The project team will also raise educators' awareness about the importance of gender equitable computer science instruction, and empower them with best practices to welcome, prepare and retain girls in coding.  The Code: SciGirls! Activity Guide will provide educators with a relevant resource for engaging aspiring computer scientists. The new media and guide will also reside on PBSLearningMedia.org, reaching 1.2 million teachers, and will be shared with thousands of educators across the SciGirls CONNECT and National Girls Collaborative networks. The new episodes are anticipated to reach 92% of U.S. TV households via PBS, and the game at PBSKids.org will introduce millions of children to coding. The summative evaluation will examine the reach and impact of the episodes, game and new activities. PIs will share research findings and project resources at national conferences and will submit to relevant publications.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

This project will study how concepts are generalized from individual examples, thus continuing to inform the cognitive science literature on this topic. The experiments will present students with multiple examples of science concepts according to different timing patterns so that students can abstract similarities and differences among them. The studies will directly address a seemingly paradoxical set of findings: presenting examples at the same time and apart in time have both been shown to promote science learning. As such, this work will resolve conflicting findings in cognitive science and science education and, in turn, will generate a body of research that elucidates fruitful methods for designing learning environments. The long-term goal of this work is to provide STEM educators with educative curricular material supplements that outline the timing patterns that promote students' learning outcomes. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>A series of experiments will test conflicting but possibly mutually informing hypotheses. One line of research in cognitive science has proposed that presenting examples of science concepts simultaneously promotes students' abstraction and immediate generalization of concepts. However, another line of work has argued that spacing presentations across time promotes students' abstraction and long-term generalization of concepts. The current work bridges these two lines of research by examining the conditions under which simultaneous and spaced presentations promote students' generalization. The central hypothesis in this work is that developmental changes in students' cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory, and science knowledge, will create shifts in which presentation schedule promotes their generalization of concepts. The results of this work will generate a cognitive model of how presentation timing impacts students' science learning. This cognitive model will allow researchers and STEM educators to make predictions about the presentation timing that will best promote students' acquisition and generalization of science concepts."

This study is significant since the NGSS depend on local discretion in operationalizing foundational ideals in classroom instruction, yet few systems and schools are organized to support teachers in doing so. As such, this  project will address the need for additional knowledge and experiences for teachers to effectively implement the NGSS. In addition, it will develop and test a practical theory of organization and management detailing key domains of work that are essential to bridging academic standards to classroom instruction. It will construct models of effective, system-level and school-level science learning environments to enact this theoretical framework. The project serves the national interest by characterizing what makes school systems and schools effective in supporting fundamental change in teaching and learning such as NGSS, which will allow others to build on these insights, thus supporting the development of more effective school experiences with STEM for all students.  <br/><br/>The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Using a descriptive, theory-building longitudinal research approach, the project will investigate how systems and schools are responding to NGSS through a series of five studies. The program of research will target 12 school districts and 24 elementary schools in 3 states that are currently implementing NGSS. A comparative case study design across the five studies will feature cross-disciplinary collaboration among researchers with complementary expertise in studying systems, schools, and state level instructional improvement. This approach will advance knowledge of educational policy, system and school improvement, and instructional improvement by addressing a fundamental challenge of contemporary education reform: the coordination of national and state academic standards with teaching and learning in classrooms. Outcomes from this research will make contributions to broader social progress through support for schools and systems in ensuring excellence and equity in educational opportunities offered to students. These outcomes will also develop a practical theory of organization and management which, in turn, will increase the potential for directly guiding improvements in science learning, teaching, and outcomes at scale in larger numbers of schools. These supports will be beneficial to schools and systems that are experiencing standards as punitive policy instruments, rather than as resources for motivating and supporting instructional transformation. Massive open online courses, policy briefs, university and school-oriented publications, and major social media outlets will be used to disseminate results broadly to educators and education policymakers and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach that has emerged is the use of simulations to engage teachers in approximations of practice where the focus is on helping them learn how to engage in ambitious content teaching. In particular, recent technological advances have supported the emergence of new kinds of digital simulations and have brought increased attention to simulations as a tool to enhance teacher learning.  This project will develop and implement a working conference for scholars and practitioners to articulate current use cases and theories of action regarding the use of simulations in PreK-12 science and mathematics teacher education.

Using community-based participatory research,  human-centered design, and developmental evaluation approaches, this project will co-create a national community science project, which is a form of Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR) or citizen science. The project seeks to increase inclusion and equity in STEM, while building capacity in research and science through leadership and participation by both historically underrepresented communities and established academic institutions. Participants will record their levels of perceived stress and well-being in relation to their local soundscape. This project will help to connect participants, specifically youth and their families from communities underrepresented and underserved in STEM, with science and nature through learning that is authentic and relevant to their lives.  With support of a mobile app, community science project participants explore and map soundscapes to identify areas of ""excessive noise"" as well as ""noise refuges."" Community-led dissemination of results will inform adoption of community science projects by other community-based organizations. The project is a collaboration involving fifteen community leaders, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Metro Atlanta Urban Farm in Atlanta, WorldBeat Center in San Diego, CLUES in St. Paul, MN, and Camp Compass in Allentown, PA.<br/><br/>PPSR has exciting potential to engage broad audiences in STEM learning and research, particularly when projects are genuinely co-created by local communities, scientists, and educators. Using a community-based participatory research approach in the project fosters direct involvement from community members in integration of science practices and learning, from the development of the research questions, design of the study, to analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of results. Human-centered design is important as it is an established collaborative approach for addressing real-world problems facing human communities. In this project, human-centered design will include technology in the problem-solving phases of inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Developmental evaluation will provide on-going direct feedback to the project team over the project lifespan with respect to equity and inclusion in PPSR, an informal STEM learning environment. The project will further knowledge and understanding of soundscapes and noise pollution, enable use of mobile apps to map soundscapes in urban environments, and contribute to the relationship of noise to well-being.The project will produce conceptual frameworks and practical resources (toolkits) to guide future community-based PPSR efforts. Results from this project will advance knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors of PPSR practitioners regarding equity, diversity, and inclusion of underrepresented audiences in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is developing 400 new test items that are based on core content domains for life science and are aligning these items with the previous National Science Education Standards to provide a connection to the earlier MOSART assessments. The project is also developing and validating two test instruments that address the cross cutting concepts of energy and matter for grades K-12, with a specific focus on flows, cycles and conservation. The new assessments will be made available to other researchers and practitioner through the project website and their on-line assessment system.<br/><br/>The assessment development is based on the process used in prior work that has produced the other MOSART instruments, including design efforts of assessment specialists, teachers, and learning scientists.  Pilot items are tested through crowd-sourcing with online adult test takers.  Classic test theory techniques, item response theory and Bayesian techniques model the student responses. Outcomes consist of item parameters, test and sub-test characteristics, and predictive linkages among items. A stratified, nationally representative sample of 250 high school biology teachers field test the items with classrooms of students. Descriptive statistics are generated to establish the state of student knowledge, pre-and post-test performance by item and by standard, and teacher knowledge, including the fraction of items for which teachers have correctly identified the most popular wrong answer. Descriptive analyses are followed by hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) of students within classrooms to examine the relationships between student and teacher knowledge. The dependent variables in HLM are student gain scores. Independent variables include teachers' knowledge, and student performance on grade K-8 assessments. <br/><br/>The MOSART instruments have been a strong line of assessment tools that are based on a model of cognition with a strong research base in misconceptions in science education. That research base is only slowly being augmented with a more coherent framework on learning progressions in STEM education, and the MOSART instruments will have the potential for extensive use for the foreseeable future. The grades 9-12 life science instrument based on coupling core ideas with science and engineering practices addresses the gaps in the current MOSART system of assessments. Given the rich literature on misconceptions in life science and the ubiquity of life science as a course at the high school level, the instrument promises to be as useful as the one for K-8 developed with MSP RETA funding. The new instruments on cross-cutting concepts provides a much needed set of assessments for researchers and practitioners, particularly teacher professional development providers. The transition to coupling core content and sciences practices with both the life sciences and the cross-cutting concepts is an opportunity to expand and update the suite of instruments."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The project is responsive to the societal challenges emerging from the nation's diverse and rapidly changing student demographics, including the rise of English language learners (ELLs), the fastest growing student population (see, for example, ""U.S. school enrollment hits majority-minority milestone"", Education Week, February 1, 2015). ELLs have grown exponentially: 1 in 5 students (21%) in the nation spoke a language other than English at home in 2011. The project's main purpose is to develop instructional materials for a year-long, fifth grade curriculum for all students, including ELLs. The planned curriculum will promote language-focused and three-dimensional science learning (through blending of science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas), aligned with the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012), the Next Generation Science Standards (Achieve, 2013), and the Conceptual Framework for Language use in the Science Classroom (Lee, Quinn & Valds, 2013). The grade-level science content will target topics, such as structure and properties of matter, matter and energy in organisms and ecosystems, and Earth's and space systems, with engineering design embedded in each topic. The language approach will emphasize analytical science tasks aimed at making sense of and constructing scientific knowledge; and receptive (listening and reading) and productive (speaking and writing) language functions. Products and research results from this project will help to reduce the science achievement gap between ELLs and non-ELLs, and enable all students to attain higher levels of proficiency in subsequent grade levels.<br/><br/>After the curriculum has been developed and field-tested during Years 1-3, a pilot study will be conducted in Year 4 to investigate promise of effectiveness. Using a randomized controlled trial design, the pilot study will address three research questions: (1) What is the impact of the intervention on science learning and language development for all students, including ELLs and former ELLs?; (2) What is the impact of the intervention on teachers' instructional practices?; and (3) To what extent are teachers able to implement the instructional materials with fidelity? To address research question 1, a sequence of multi-level models (MLMs) in which the posttest score for each student measure (the state/district science test score, and the science score and the language score on the researcher-developed assessment) will be regressed on a dummy variable representing condition (treatment or control) and pretest covariates. To examine whether the intervention is beneficial for students of varying levels of English proficiency, subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing ELLs in the treatment group against ELLs in the control group; former ELLs in the treatment group against former ELLs in the control group; and non-ELLs in the treatment group against non-ELLs in the control group, using the same MLMs. Exploratory analyses will be employed to examine the extent to which the level of English proficiency moderates the impact of the intervention on ELLs. To address research question 2, a 2-level model (teachers as level-1, and schools as level-2) in which the post-questionnaire scale score will be regressed on a dummy variable representing condition (treatment or control) will be conducted. To address research question 3, plans are to analyze ratings on coverage, adherence, and quality of instruction from classroom observations, along with ratings on program differentiation and participant responsiveness from the implementation and feedback form."

The project will focus on middle school environmental science disciplinary core ideas in life, Earth, and physical sciences.  There are a wide variety of complex systems principles at work in disturbance ecology. This project serves as a starting point on supporting students to coordinate different sources of information to parse out the direct and indirect effects of disturbances on components of a system and to examine the interconnections between components to predict whether a system will return to equilibrium (resilience) or the system will change into a new state (hysteresis). These same complex systems principles can be applied to other scientific phenomena, such as homeostasis and the spread of infectious disease.  This project will bring the excitement of Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) to classrooms outside of Puerto Rico, and has a special emphasis on low performing, low income, high minority schools in Chicago. Over 6000 students will directly benefit from participation in the research program. The units will be incorporated into the Journey to El Yunque web site for dissemination throughout Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the LTER network. The units will be submitted for review at the Achieve network, thus extending the reach to teachers around the country. The project will impact science teachers and curriculum designers through an online course on storyline development. This project aims to improve students' ability to engage in argument from evidence and address what the literature has identified as a significant challenge, namely the ability to evaluate evidence. Researchers will also demonstrate how it is possible to make progress on implementing Next Generation Science Standards in low performing schools. Through the web-based platform, these results can be replicated across many other school districts.<br/><br/>Researchers will to use the scientific context of the LTER program to develop a generalized storyline template for using evidence-based modeling to teach basic principles of disturbance ecology. Though a co-design process with middle school teachers in CPS, researchers will test the application of learning principles to a generalized storyline template by developing and evaluating three units on disturbance ecology - one life science, one Earth system science, and one physical science. Through a task analysis, researchers have identified three key areas of support for students to be successful at explaining how a system will respond to a disturbance. First, students need to be able to record evidence in a manner that will guide them to developing their explanation. Causal model diagrams have been used successfully in the past to organize evidence, but little is known about how students can use their causal diagrams for developing explanations. Second, there have been a wide variety of scaffolds developed to support the evaluation of scientific arguments, but less is known about how to support students in organizing their evidence to produce scientific arguments. Third, evidence-based modeling and scientific argumentation are not tasks that can be successfully accomplished by following a recipe. Students need to develop a task model to understand the reason why they are engaged in a particular task and how that task will contribute to the primary goal of explanation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On-camera hosts, scientists and naturalists in locations across the U.S., and scores of citizen scientists will use observation and scientific inquiry to explore the workings of nature during this season of rebirth. The unfolding stories of seasonal change will illuminate larger scientific insights--into the biodiversity of species in habitats, the interconnectedness of plants and animals in diverse ecosystems, the global phenomenon of species migration, and how spring ""green-up"" can be affected by environmental change--while inspiring appreciation for species conservation and habitat preservation. Spring LIVE is conceived as an ongoing series, with this inaugural season composed of three one-hour programs broadcast live on three consecutive nights, along with real-time interactions via Facebook. Reaching long-standing Nature viewers (2.5 million per episode), Spring LIVE will seek to turn mature adults and diverse families into citizen science doers, and leverage younger Nature online audiences through social media and community engagement in partnership with citizen science projects. <br/><br/>Spring LIVE will build public knowledge of and engagement in phenology and citizen science.  The project will also conduct knowledge-building research on the effectiveness of Facebook as a science learning tool.

Its fundamental purpose is to examine and gather initial validity evidence for assessments designed to measure and build Kindergarten-fifth grade science teachers' content knowledge for teaching (CKT) about matter and its interactions in teacher education settings. The selection of this topic will facilitate the development of a proof-of-concept to determine if and how CKT assessments can be developed and used to measure and build elementary teachers' CKT. Also, it will facilitate rapid and targeted refinement of an evidence-centered design process that could be applied to other science topics. Plans are to integrate CKT assessments and related resources into teacher education courses to support the ability of teachers to apply their content knowledge to the work of teaching and learning science. The project will combine efforts from prior projects and engage in foundational research to examine the nature of teachers' CKT and to build theories and hypotheses about the productive use and design of CKT assessment materials to support formative and summative uses. Likewise, the project will create a set of descriptive cases highlighting the use of these tools. Understanding how CKT science assessments can be leveraged as summative tools to evaluate current efforts, and as formative tools to build elementary teachers' specialized, practice-based knowledge will be the central foci of this effort. <br/><br/>The main research questions will be: (1) What is the nature of elementary science teachers' CKT about matter and its interactions?; and (2) How can the development of prospective elementary teachers' CKT be supported within teacher education? To address the research questions, the study will employ a mixed-methods, design-based research approach to gather various sources of validity evidence to support the formative and summative use of the CKT instrument, instructional tasks, and supporting materials. The project will be organized around two main research and development strands. Strand One will build an empirically grounded understanding of the nature of elementary teachers' CKT. Strand Two will focus on developing and studying how CKT instructional tasks can be used formatively within teacher education settings to build elementary teachers' CKT. In addition, the project will refine a conceptual framework that identifies the science-specific teaching practices that comprise the work of teaching science. This will be used as well to assess the CKT that teachers leverage when recognizing, understanding, and responding to the content-intensive practices that they engage in as they teach science. To that end, the study will build on two existing frameworks from prior NSF-funded work. The first was originally developed to create CKT assessments for elementary and middle school teachers in English Language Arts and mathematics. The second focuses on the content challenges that novice elementary science teachers face.

The project, Learning Through Collaborative Design Professional Development to Foster Productive Epistemic Discourse in Science, will examine an activity that is often used for the generation of curricular materials, collaborative design, and explore its promise in fostering biology teachers' professional growth as part of a larger professional development experience focused on epistemic practice.  It will establish epistemic discourse as both a means of communication and a learning outcome in high school biology classrooms.  The program goals are to understand the role of collaborative designs in shaping science teachers' learning about and enactment of instruction that fosters productive epistemic discourse in science, and to produce knowledge about teacher learning that can inform the design of professional development programs around productive epistemic discourse in science. The outcomes of this research will provide insight into teacher learning around a more robust understanding of science teaching, design principles essential in creating effective approaches to professional development, and a field tested professional development experience.

The project from the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) will use musical sound as a relevant venue for middle and high school students to explore and connect with the science of waves. Music is of widespread interest among adolescent populations, and the connections between music, science and math are vast and deep rooted in history; in particular, the relationship between sound and the science of waves. The work being proposed has long been carrying out outreach activities centered on the science of music and have recently created and implemented Listening to Waves, a hands-on learning program that offers an in-depth introduction to the physics of waves through the making, gathering and analyzing of musical sound and the use of digital technologies. The goal of this project is to further expand and develop a learning program that seeks to build a connection between the sonic world and the physics of waves; evaluating the impact of the program on the general attitudes of participants towards science. The objectives of the project will be 1: to implement the program in after-school settings, catering to an underrepresented population of learners, 2: to iteratively refine the program in order to maximize student interest, enjoyment, and learning opportunities; thus generating a detailed lesson plan applied and tested in underrepresented populations, 3: to increase career awareness using the physics of waves as a common denominator, and 4: to analyze the impact of the programming in the way the students relate to the world of sound, their interest in science and their science identity. Waves are pervasive in the physical world and a deep knowledge of the behavior of waves is fundamental to the physical sciences, and in many fields such as chemistry, neurobiology, or geology, electronic and structural engineering. Moreover, understanding waves is a key element of understanding signal processing and is thus an important component of career preparedness for the information and communications technology (ICT) workplace and the entertainment industry. <br/><br/>The students will learn the hidden and ubiquitous world of waves as they make and analyze musical sound by creating waves and vibrations in physical objects, use digital technology to analyze waveforms and acoustic properties and to create sound and music, and explore how sound is propagated through the environment and represented in the brain. The classes will be primarily taught by computational neurobiologist and by cognitive scientist and ethnomusicologist, receiving assistance from hired engineering undergraduate students from UCSD, recruited through the Gordon Leadership Center. The course will meet twice a week for the duration of 10 weeks and it will be implemented in after-school settings for students in grades 7-9. The learning goal is for students to understand what sound is, how objects vibrate, and how sound is propagated in space. It is intended for students to develop intuitive notions of frequency decompositions (Fourier transforms), understand the way in which objects vibrate (nodes, vibrational modes), and the general relationship between the objects' shapes and materials and the sound they produce. The students should understand the concepts of resonance and frequency filtering. Also, the students should understand the basics of digital signal generation and measuring: measuring tools, sampling rate, dynamic range, cut-off frequencies, signal to noise ratio, time-scales. In addition, students will develop engineering skills while creating musical instruments maximizing vibrational amplitude and sound richness, develop their capacity to work collaboratively and their communicative skills while video documenting and presenting their creations."

The growing outdoor prescription movement is designed to increase the amount of time children spend outside in nature. Programs are structured so that health care providers write ""prescriptions"" for children to engage in outdoor activity, and informal educators ""fill"" these prescriptions by facilitating youth and family participation in outdoor activities. There is preliminary evidence that these programs are getting kids outside, but best practices for transitioning ""get outside"" programs to become ""get outside and learn about the environment"" programs remain unidentified. PLUM RX is designed to build this knowledge and create resources that are responsive to the needs of both English and Spanish-speaking urban families.  The project will work with informal educators and families through multiple cycles of implementation and revision, testing and refining PLUM LANDING resources (animations, videos, games, hands-on science activities, and support materials for informal educators and families), with the goal of designing an effective and accessible PLUM RX Toolkit for national dissemination.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) learning in informal environments.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is designed to ensure that the PLUM RX Toolkit--the resources and support materials--will meet the needs of educators working in non-specialized urban settings. Education Development Center (EDC) and WGBH developers will collaborate on design-based research at three urban outdoor prescription programs serving low-income families: Philadelphia Nature Rx in Philadelphia, PA; Outdoors Rx in Boston, MA; and Portland Rx Play in Portland, OR.  Moving through cycles of implementation, observation, analysis, and revision, the research team will work closely with educators, families, and developers to determine how the programmatic and structural features of the learning environment, the actions of the educators, and the intervention itself can most effectively support children and families' outdoor exploration in urban contexts. Toolkit materials will include resources for kids and families (including Spanish-speaking families) and informal educators (including those who work with families and directly with children in out-of-school settings). Directors from the three urban outdoor prescription programs will contribute to every phase of the research process, including recruiting families and youth who will participate in a weekly sequence of activities. The overarching focus of the analysis process will be on systematically describing the interaction between two dimensions of implementation: What happened during pilot implementations, and the factors that constrained or supported implementation as planned; and the quality of what happened, which will be defined with reference to the intended impacts. EDC will use a structured descriptive coding process to analyze the qualitative evidence gathered through interviews and observations during design and testing periods. Products of the research activities will include: a series of formative memos to the development team; a report mapping changes made to PLUM RX Toolkit materials in response to formative input and the intended impact of those changes; and findings regarding commonalities and differences across sites in the interaction of local contextual factors and the implementation success of the PLUM RX Toolkit.  Concord Evaluation Group (CEG) will provide independent, summative evaluation of the project.  Through this process, PLUM RX will build broader knowledge about how to design educational resources, geared for both families and informal educators, which respond to the unique challenges of exploring environmental science in urban environments."

This four year research project examines youth participation in PPSR projects that are facilitated by Natural History Museums (NHMs). NHMs, like PPSR, have a dual focus on scientific research and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.  The NHMs in this project have established in-person and online PPSR programs and have close ties with local urban community-based organizations. Together, these traits make NHMs appropriate informal learning settings to study how young people participate in PPSR and what they learn.  This study focuses on three types of PPSR experiences: short-term outdoor events like bioblitzes, long-term outdoor environmental monitoring projects, and online PPSR projects such as crowdsourcing the ID of field observations. The findings of this study will be shared through PPSR networks as well as throughout the field in informal STEM learning in order to strength youth programming in STEM, such that youth are empowered to engage in STEM research and activities in their communities. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.  <br/><br/>The study employs observations, surveys, interviews, and learning analytics to explore three overarching questions about youth learning: 1) What is the nature of the learning environments and what activities do youth engage in when participating in NHM-led PPSR? 2) To what extent do youth develop three science learning outcomes, through participation in NHM-led citizen science programs? The three are: a) An understanding of the science content, b) identification of roles for themselves in the practice of science, and c) a sense of agency for taking actions using science? 3) What program features and settings in NHM-led PPSR foster these three science learning outcomes among youth? Based on studies occurring at multiple NHMs in the US and the UK, the broader impact of this study includes providing research-based recommendations for NHM practitioners that will help make PPSR projects and learning science more accessible and productive for youth. This project is collaboration between education researchers at University of California, Davis and Open University (UK), and Oxford University (UK) and citizen science practitioners, educators, and environmental scientists at three NHMs in the US and UK: NHM London, California Academy of Sciences, and NHM Los Angeles."

Despite the potential for academic and career success in STEM, students with learning disabilities participate in advanced science courses and pursue STEM careers at much lower rates than their peers. The project will focus on the motivational beliefs of middle and high school students with learning disabilities as largely neglected but likely powerful influences on science trajectories, contributing to the goal of fostering an inclusive STEM educational system and workforce.<br/><br/>The research will take place in three phases, addressing multiple perspectives and levels of analysis. In the first phase, a national longitudinal dataset (High School Longitudinal Study 2009) will be analyzed to investigate the relationship between motivational beliefs of high-school students with learning disabilities and subsequent pursuit of advanced science coursework and careers. In the second phase, a mixed-methods study with 80 middle-school students with learning disabilities will investigate how science instructional experiences shape motivational beliefs. The third phase will focus on the teacher perspective, working with a cadre of master science teachers to understand teachers' perceptions of learning disabilities and to co-develop practical resources for use in science classrooms. The education plan similarly uses multiple approaches to have impact. These include: 1) integrating project theory and research across the University of Rochester's masters-level courses for future educators in STEM and special education, 2) improving doctoral-level research methods courses by developing courses aligned with the project's varied research methods, 3) partnering with master teaching fellows who are current science teachers with the ability to improve STEM outcomes in area schools, and 4) developing professional development experiences to inform science instructional practices.<br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. Contemporary science education reforms consider modeling as a means to understanding science ideas and as an essential scientific practice to be learned. Modeling is the practice of developing and refining representations (or ""models"") as analogs of scientific phenomena. Important to the practice of modeling is the idea that, as an analog, a model draws out (or ""abstracts"") some as opposed to all aspects of a phenomenon. However, a well-known problem in modeling instruction is that leaners have difficulty understanding this essential point.  Learners often think of models as literal interpretations, or replicas, of what they represent. The investigators hypothesize that engaging students in a process of abstraction -- that is, drawing out common structures from multiple scientific phenomena -- during the creation (or ""synthesis"") of their own model will help students better understand the nature of scientific models.  Importantly, this approach will help students discover that a scientific model is not simply a literal interpretation, or replica, of any single phenomenon.  Sixteen teachers and their estimated 960 students from economically challenged communities in Georgia and Maine will participate in and benefit from the research study in the context of high school earth and environmental science classes. The project will develop a short instructional sequence and new student learning assessments that are implemented in earth science classes. The findings will help the field to understand whether the process of abstracting from multiple phenomena during model construction supports students' understanding of scientific models in relation to earth science ideas and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The project will provide professional development workshops to up to forty-six teachers over three years as means of recruiting research participants and to cultivate teacher leadership around the new approach to modeling. The developed products and the research findings will be shared with researchers, teacher educators, and teachers through science education journals and conferences. <br/><br/>This Exploratory Learning Strand research study builds upon prior work of investigators at University of Georgia and University of Maine by rigorously testing their hypothesis that that engaging students in the process of abstracting from multiple source phenomena during model synthesis supports more scientifically accurate understandings of the nature of models.  The research has the potential to (1) generate new knowledge about the potential value of abstraction as a guiding principle of learning about models and modeling practice; (2) identify ways in which specific classroom conditions, including teacher talk and actions, enable or hinder student learning about abstraction in models and modeling practice; and (3) demonstrate how teachers translate the modeling approach to other science disciplines they teach.  Teachers will be recruited through existing partnerships with schools and through professional development workshops offered to teachers nearby the two universities. To address the first two goals, the investigators will develop and test a two-part instructional sequence that addresses core ideas in earth science and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The first component of the instructional sequence is a typical model-based inquiry, and the second component requires that students abstract structures from multiple phenomena during the synthesis of their own models.  Twelve teachers and their students will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The treatment group will experience the two-part instructional sequence. The control group will initially not experience the second component, but will have an opportunity to do so at the conclusion of the study. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of classroom observations, interviews with teachers, student knowledge tests, student work, and teacher logs will be used to determine the effectiveness of abstracting during model synthesis and classroom conditions that enable or hinder students' learning when the approach is used. To address the third goal, investigators will document the experience of four teachers as they develop and implement a similar instructional sequence in other science disciplines, providing preliminary evidence on the broader utility of the synthesis-through-abstraction approach to modeling. A new research assessment for measuring students' understanding of the nature of models, core ideas of earth science, and the cross-cutting concept of scale may be broadly useful for future research on learning at the intersection of the three knowledge dimensions. Findings will be shared by traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed research and practitioner journals and conference presentations. Investigators will conduct professional development workshops for teachers in the third year to disseminate the products and findings of the research to practitioner audiences and to further cultivate participating teachers' leadership around this novel approach to modeling practice in science education."

It was submitted to the Discovery Research K-12 program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. The goal of this study will be to improve elementary science teaching and learning by developing, testing, and refining a framework and set of tools for strategically incorporating forms of uncertainty central to scientists' sense-making into students' empirical learning. The framework will rest on the notion that productive uncertainty should be carefully built into students' empirical learning experiences in order to support their engagement in scientific practices and understanding of disciplinary ideas. To re-conceptualize the role of empirical investigations, the study will focus on the transitions between the experiences and processes students seek to understand, classroom investigations, evidence, and explanatory models as opportunities for sense-making, and how uncertainty can be built into these transitions. The project's underlying assumption is that carefully implementing these forms of uncertainty will help curriculum developers and teachers avoid the oversimplified investigations that are prevalent in K-8 classrooms that stand in stark contrast to authentic science learning and the recommendations of the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012). Accordingly, the project will seek to develop curriculum design guidelines, teacher tools, professional development supports, and four elaborated investigations, including sets of lessons, videos, and assessments that embed productive uncertainty for second and fifth graders and designed for use with linguistically, culturally, and socio-economically diverse students. <br/><br/>The hypothesis of this work is that if specific forms of scientific uncertainty are carefully selected, and if teachers can implement these forms of uncertainty, elementary students will have more robust opportunities to develop disciplinary practices and ideas in ways consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Lead States, 2013). Employing Design-Based Research, the three research questions will be: (1) What opportunities for sense-making do elementary school empirical investigations afford where we might strategically build uncertainty?; (2) How can we design learning environments where uncertainty in empirical investigations supports opportunities for learning?; and (3) In classrooms with sustained opportunities to engage with uncertainty in empirical investigations, what progress do students make in content understandings and the practices of argumentation, explanation, and investigation? The work will consist of three design cycles: Design Cycle 1 will involve two small groups of six teachers in adapting their curricula to incorporate uncertainty, then describe how students engage around uncertainty in empirical investigations. Design Cycle 2 will involve the same small groups in implementing and refining task structures, tools, and teacher instructional strategies. In Design Cycle 3, teachers and researchers will further refine lesson materials, assessments, and supports. The project will partner with one school district and engage in design research with groups of teachers to develop: (1) a research-based description, with exemplars of opportunities for student sense-making within empirical investigations at both early and upper elementary grades; (2) a set of design principles and tools that allow teachers to elicit and capitalize on sense-making about uncertainty in investigations; and (3) four elementary investigations elaborated to incorporate and exemplify the first two products above. These materials will be disseminated through a website, and established networks for supporting implementation of the NGSS. An advisory board will oversee project progress and conduct both formative and summative evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study is important because of persistent disinterest by secondary students in mathematics in the United States. This study will examine how high school teachers can design lessons so that mathematical content itself is the source of student intrigue, pursuit, and passion. To do this, the content within mathematical lessons (both planned and enacted) is framed as mathematical stories and the felt tension between how information is revealed and withheld from students as the mathematical story unfolds is framed as its mathematical plot. The Mathematical Story Framework (Dietiker, 2013, 2015) foregrounds both the coherence (does the story make sense?) and aesthetic (does it stimulate anticipation for what is to come, and if so, how?) dimensions of mathematics lessons. The project will generate principles for lesson design usable by teachers in other settings and exemplar lessons that can be shared. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project draws from prior curriculum research and design to (a) develop a theory of teacher MCLE design and enactment with the Mathematical Story Framework, (b) increase the understanding(s) of the aesthetic nature of mathematics curriculum by both researchers and teachers, and (c) generate detailed MCLE exemplars that demonstrate curricular coherence, cognitive demand, and aesthetic dimensions of mathematical lessons. The project is grounded in a design-based research framework for education research. A team of experienced high school teachers will design and test MCLEs (four per teacher) with researchers through three year-long cycles. Prior to the first cycle, data will be collected (interview, observations) to record initial teacher curricular strategies regarding student dispositions toward mathematics. Then, a professional development experience will introduce the Mathematical Story Framework, along with other curricular frameworks to support the planning and enacting of lessons (i.e., cognitive demand and coherence). During the design cycles, videotaped observations and student aesthetic measures (surveys and interviews) for both MCLEs and a non-MCLEs (randomly selected to be the lesson before or after the MCLE) will be collected to enable comparison. Also, student dispositional measures, collected at the beginning and end of each cycle, will be used to learn whether and how student attitudes in mathematics change over time. Of the MCLEs designed and tested, a sample will be selected (based on aesthetic and mathematical differences) and developed into models, complete with the rationale for and description of aesthetic dimensions."

The four project objectives are to:  1) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' use and integration of technology into their learning experiences; 2) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM learning as compared to students in other district STEM-focused programs; 3) decrease gaps in achievement and technical skills among student populations by gender, racial/ethnic background, and economic level; and 4) increase the Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM career awareness and interest. The Academy establishes a single site, centrally located in the district, which provides a state-of-the-art laboratory facility and well-trained teachers with engineering degrees.  Students from the district's more than 40 high schools are able to access high quality lab facilities and teachers not typically available to local high schools. Approximately 100 freshmen will enroll in the Academy each year, selected on the basis of qualifying scores on the ACT Explore assessment, completion of a statement of interest for engineering or engineering technology, and a letter of parental support. Primary partners in the project are Shelby County Schools (formerly Memphis City Schools) and the Herff College of Engineering at the University of Memphis.<br/><br/>The project design is a hybrid model that permits students to remain at their geographically assigned school for a program of study that incorporates Internet-based curriculum intended for flexible use based upon national best practice implementation and integration strategies.  All students will take Introduction to Engineering and Principles of Engineering, providing students with the opportunity to link content and apply it to solve real-world problems. Students then choose an elective track from the focus areas of civil engineering & architecture, biotechnology, manufacturing or energy and participate in corresponding laboratory exercises and projects as they attend the lab facility during the evenings or on Saturday. ITEST strategies to enhance student interest include student support, teacher support, STEM interest development, and partnership development. Capacity-building includes training of STEM teachers at home schools, tutoring from engineering undergraduates, and engagement of local industries for site visits and internships. The evaluation plan utilizes a quasi-experimental design with formative and summative analyses of data sources that include enrollment and retention figures, student performance (GPA, ACT, AP, End of Course Tests, observation, interest inventories, graduation rates), and professional development participation. The method of analysis will include both descriptive statistics and inferential tests, including associated effect sizes.<br/><br/>Project deliverables and products will include a detailed description of the model and the implementation plan as well as research articles, reports, and presentations regarding the effectiveness of the project model and its impact on improving student interest, identity, and persistence in STEM. Approximately, 400 students (in grades 9 - 12) and 70 STEM teachers will be directly targeted during the project period.  However, the project will also reach and serve middle school students who express initial interest in STEM careers.  The Virtual STEM Academy is designed to create broader impacts locally, regionally, and nationally in K-12 and higher education environments by addressing some of the challenges faced by large, urban school districts in their efforts to offer STEM programs of study with limited resources (human and fiscal) and/or student interest at one particular school.  The model developed will demonstrate how an innovative approach that leverages existing resources can be used to create a unique learning opportunity for students without having them transfer to a magnet school.  The findings from this project will not only support the efforts of large, urban districts but may also be relevant to small, rural school districts that face similar challenges."

This cognitive capability is critical for the practices of computational thinking and problem solving across  STEM and computing domains. However, the development and enactment of representational flexibility in cognitive processes is effortful and demanding for most learners, but particularly so for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence suggests that students with ASD enrolling in colleges are more likely than members of the general population or other disability groups to gravitate toward STEM-related majors, but their need for training in representational flexibility has been identified as a barrier to their college enrollment. This project aims to study individualized training of representational flexibility for STEM and computational  reasoning and problem solving among adolescents with ASD, hence addressing a significant barrier to college enrollment of this learner group who otherwise have the potential to become future sources of STEM talent. Researchers will  utilize 3D virtual reality (VR) with body sensory technologies to create an adaptive, representational flexibility training program that helps participants learn how to design and code simulations and games in a 3D virtual-reality context. This program, called Force and Motion-Adaptive Representation (FM-AR), will facilitate participants' ability to select, connect, convert, and construct multimodal representations of physics and mathematics problems while practicing and experimenting with computational concepts during VR-based simulation design and programming. As a result of the powerful innovation and application of computing in STEM disciplines, the STEM+C program supports research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. This interdisciplinary project will advance the research and practice of STEM+Computing education by investigating representational flexibility as the critical threshold for integrating computational thinking in and across STEM domains, and specifying the conditions that lead to the development and manifestation of representational flexibility, especially for learners with special needs.<br/> <br/> Via a  design-based, mixed-method research of the computational behaviors of adolescents with ASD and their learning outcomes in the FM-AR program, the following research questions will be investigated: 1. What representational practices will adolescents with ASD implement during FM-AR-supported simulation design and programming?  2. How and under what circumstances will adolescents with ASD demonstrate representational flexibility for computational reasoning and scientific/mathematical problem solving? 3. How will adolescents with ASD interact with adaptive representational-practice support in FM-AR? What is the effect of the adaptive support on participants? development of representational flexibility during physics- and math-related computational practices? Researchers will study the above research questions with (a) individualized selection and presentation of representational-practice tasks in variant types and flexibility demands; (b) representational performance assessment via real-time learner data mining and modeling; and (c) assessment-driven cues and prompts to scaffold representation interpretation, comparison, coordination, and adaptation during physics- and mathematics-related computational practices. This project aims to generate a conceptual and design framework governing the design and research of a STEM+Computing learning environment that scaffolds representational flexibility for a heterogeneous learner group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students who fail algebra are more likely to drop out of high school. A team of researchers at the University of Chicago and Loyola University Chicago will conduct a set of experimental studies to explore how gesture and use of manipulatives may improve understanding of mathematical equivalence. a fundamental, pre-algebraic building block. Young children often have misconceptions about this concept??they can correctly solve problems like 3+4+5=___ , but when faced with a problem like 3+4+5=___+5, they add all of the numbers together, or just add the numbers to the left of the equal sign. This misconception often leads to difficulties with algebra. The researchers will test how two forms of movement that students and teachers already use in a classroom setting can be used to improve learning outcomes: actions, performed directly on objects, and gestures, movements of the hands that can communicate ideas along with speech. Previous work shows that both action and gesture have powerful effects on how children think and learn. Through a series of studies, the research team will explore (1) how children learn, generalize, and retain an understanding of mathematical equivalence after learning through action or gesture, (2) how spoken instruction can be used with action and gesture to affect learning outcomes, and (3) how action and gesture can be combined in instruction to bolster learning. To motivate future work and refine educational practices, behavioral methods and neuroimaging techniques will be used to understand how action and gesture produce their effects. By considering how the brain changes over the course of learning, it will be possible to gain a clearer understanding of the aspects of gesture and action that should be emphasized in the creation of teaching tools. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to investigate how action and gesture instruction affect children?s ability to learn, generalize, and retain information relevant to developing the pre-algebraic concept of mathematical equivalence. Action and gesture are both powerful tools that can shape cognition. However, these tools may promote learning in different ways and thus may be beneficial at different stages of the learning process. The supported projects explore this hypothesis, and have 3 specific goals:  (1) To determine how action and gesture can best be used not only to promote initial learning of mathematical equivalence, but also to promote generalization and retention of the newly learned concept. The effects of action and gesture training will be considered on both a behavioral and neural level. Behavioral data will indicate general outcomes; neuroimaging methods will be used to differentiate between various mechanisms that could underlie the behavioral effects. Combining these methods will lead to the development of evidence-based educational techniques that target learning through action and gesture. (2) To determine how action and gesture interact with spoken instruction to promote learning, generalization, and retention of mathematical equivalence.  Spoken instruction is the most common instructional method used by teachers, and prior work suggests that gesture is more tightly integrated with speech than action. Understanding how speech interacts with gesture and action to promote learning thus has the potential to increase the utility of each of these teaching tools. (3) To determine how gesture and action can be combined to promote learning, generalization and retention of mathematical equivalence. Action may be a useful way to introduce a concept; gesture may encourage children to generalize the concept. This issue takes on importance because of the frequency with which actions on manipulatives are used in classrooms; although good at introducing learners to a concept, manipulatives may have an important downside: They may inhibit generalization to new problems. These goals will be addressed through research with 9-10 year old children in a series of between-group studies."

This will be accomplished by means of a suite of six informal learning modules that blend local/Indigenous approaches, Western STEM knowledge systems, and active learning. <br/><br/>This project will be implemented across 12 select communities in the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia - which consists of the four States of Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap - and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Jointly, these entities are referred to as the Freely Associated States (FAS). Geo-literacy refers to combining both local knowledge and Western STEM into a synthesized understanding of the world as a set of interconnected, dynamic physical, biological, and social systems, and using this integrated knowledge to make informed decisions. Applications include natural resource management, conservation, and disaster risk reduction. The project will: (1) demonstrate that the recruitment and development of an ISLT model is an effective method of engaging communities in geo-literacy activities; (2) increase geo-literacy knowledge and advocacy skills of ISLT participants; (3) produce and disseminate geo-literacy educational materials and resources (e.g., place-based teaching guides, geospatial data systems, educational apps, 2-D and 3-D models, and digital maps); and (4) provide evidence that FAS residents use these geo-literacy educational materials and resources to positively influence decision-making."

The project plans to conduct a set of research studies to develop: a theory-based and data-driven framework for equitably consequential making; a set of related individual-level and program-level cases with exemplars (and the associated challenges) that can be used by researchers and practitioners for guiding the field; and an initial set of guiding principles (with indicators) for identifying equitably consequential making in practice. The project will result in a framework for equitably consequential making with guiding principles for implementation that will contribute to the infrastructure for fostering increased opportunities to learn among all youth, especially those historically underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>Through research, the project seeks to build capacity among STEM-oriented maker practitioners, researchers and youth in the maker movement around equitably consequential making to expand the prevailing norms of making towards more transformative outcomes for youth. Project research will be guided by several questions.  What do youth learn and do (in-the-moment and over time) in making spaces that work to support equity in making? What maker space design features support (or work against) youth in making in equitably consequential ways? What are the individual and community outcomes youth experience in STEM-making across settings and time scales? What are the most salient indicators of equitably consequential making, how do they take shape, how can these indicators be identified in practice? The project will research these questions using interview studies and critical longitudinal ethnography with embedded youth participatory case study methodologies. The research will be conducted in research-practice partnerships involving Michigan State University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and 4 local, STEM- and youth-oriented making spaces in Lansing and Greensboro that serve historically underrepresented groups in STEM, with a specific focus on youth from lower-income and African American backgrounds."

The subject of physics and all of its sub-disciplines are becoming more prevalent in the public press as the research results appear to be quite interesting and important. While the physics discipline has made a Nation-wide effort to acquaint the public with physics knowledge through informal education learning experiences for years, it has not been as successful as the community desires. Thus, this project is aimed to gather all of the informal and outreach physics education efforts that have been attempted in the hope of finding the best practices for learning physics concepts and practices. A compendium will be published to inform future opportunities on how to educate the public through informal and outreach mechanisms. This project is a collaboration between Michigan State University and the University of Colorado. <br/><br/>The physics community has a long history of engaging audiences in informal education activities. Physics institutions that facilitate informal programs include university departments, national laboratories and centers, and professional societies and organizations. There is, however, no systemic understanding of how these programs are facilitated, nor an assessment of the collective impact that these programs have on participants. This project will address numerous research questions in the broad areas of Activity Detail, Structural Aspects, and Assessment. Further, their efforts will determine the ""who, what, why, where and how"" of informal physics offerings, focusing on their facilitation, impact on participants, and the academic and discipline-specific cultures from which these programs originate. The study has several definite research outcomes that will emerge from this methodology: 1) They will produce a survey of the informal efforts of university physics departments, national physics labs and national physics organizations, 2) They will develop a taxonomy of informal physics programs from which we can characterize the landscape of programs, and 3) by investigating both ""successful"" as well as ""failed"" or terminated programs, they will develop an understanding of the culture and resources needed to support outreach from these research findings. In addition, they will produce published works that can be utilized by informal practitioners and administrators in physics to examine current programs and guide the development of new programs. With regards to the research questions and framework, the overarching and driving question for this research project is: ""What is the landscape of informal physics learning, specifically, of those programs in the United States facilitated by physicists and physics students at academic institutions, national labs and by national physics organizations?"" This study will provide a robust understanding of the state of informal physics programs and outreach by physicists in the United States today. Findings will inform practitioners and administrators as to how best to support and design informal physics programming. The results will also have broad implications for other discipline-specific informal STEM programming. The primary data collection methods will be a nationwide survey and interviews with a large sample of informal practitioners from the physics community. Site visits will be conducted with a subset of these programs in order to observe programs in action and to glean insights from university participants, community partners, public, and K-12 audiences."

The need to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics at the elementary level is well documented. Moreover, very limited attention has been paid to how to teach mathematical modeling in the early grades.  The importance of this mathematical practice, in which mathematics is applied to real problems, is recognized in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and is a foundational tool used by all mathematicians. This project will design and deliver professional development for elementary grades mathematics teachers and will result in curriculum modules that focus on mathematical modeling in the elementary grades. The project is based on mathematical modeling as it is practiced in the workforce and will yield research results regarding how teachers learn about and implement the modeling process.  The project will offer an online repository as a clearinghouse for materials produced as well as a virtual interface to help facilitate a dialogue among teachers about the teaching, learning and practice of mathematical modeling.<br/><br/>The research question at the heart of this study is: How does targeted professional development in mathematical modeling affect teacher practice?  The project is an institutional partnership, with collaborating partners including: George Mason University, Harvey Mudd College and Montana State University with three respective collaborating school districts, Fairfax County Public Schools, Pomona Unified School District and Bozeman Public Schools. The project will provide high-quality teacher professional development in mathematical modeling through a content-focused summer institute and collaborative coaching through follow-up Lesson Study. The work will have broad impact as it engages elementary (grades 2-6) mathematics teachers, special educators, and teachers of students with Limited English Proficiency, to focus on: a) modeling mathematics ideas aligned to the Common Core mathematics content, classroom strategies, and student assessment standards; b) developing problem-based assessment and performance-based tasks for mathematical modeling in elementary grades; c) creating activities to differentiate instruction with parallel tasks that enrich 21st century skills in modeling (communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking) aimed at increasing the academic achievement of diverse populations (special education, gifted, Limited English Proficiency and economically disadvantaged); and d) developing need-based on-site and online web-learning professional and curricular resources (video clips of exemplar lessons, real-life math connections and concepts modeled using virtual manipulatives). The professional development web resources and tools will be available to school divisions across the respective partnering states as they are being developed and then disseminated nationally.  The project will use three levels of evaluation: an external evaluator who will conduct an annual review of project documents, including research protocols and data analysis methods, advisory board meeting agendas and supplementary materials, and reports to the funding agency; an internal review by a team member experienced with models for evaluating professional development; and peer review by an expert Advisory Board. This tri-phase model of evaluation will maximize project resources and expertise."

Building on research on effective face-to-face professional development, including research from the emerging fields of content-focused coaching and video coaching, this project will design and study professional development for middle grades mathematics teachers in rural communities. As schools turn to digital learning contexts, it is inevitable that professional development will follow a similar trend. It is imperative to have research-based models that demonstrate how the features of high-quality face-to-face professional development can be matched or augmented in online contexts. The study has the potential to contribute to research on professional development, especially in the growing areas of online professional development and coaching, and will build from and contribute to the literature on the impact of multiple modalities and synchronicities in online contexts. The project will address the critical need for models of professional development for teachers in rural areas, which has a limited research base. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) Program. The DRK-12 program supports research and development on STEM education innovations and approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment. <br/><br/>The project will develop and implement an innovative online mathematics professional development model designed to provide growth opportunities for teachers in rural districts who normally lack access to such opportunities. The study will take place in two geographically disparate locations in order to research the effectiveness of the model across contexts and to explore the resources and constraints involved in scaling up the model. The project will focus on developing teacher capacity to enact ambitious, responsive instruction aligned with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), and thus will be sustained, interactive, and of sufficient duration to help teachers transform their practices. In the design of the professional development, the project will leverage features of emerging technologies that are multimodal and involve a mix of synchronous/ asynchronous communication. The most innovative feature is the online video coaching in which a teacher and coach separately will view and notate video of the teacher's enactment of a collaboratively planned lesson as a precursor to the online post-lesson debriefing. Building from design-based research principles, the project will incorporate iterative cycles of data collection, analysis, reflection, and revision that will explore the effectiveness of the model and inform revisions."

This study will investigate high school students' experiences of engagement with mathematics and their motivation to learn, and the ways that classroom instructional climates do or do not support productive engagement with mathematics. As an important effort to help improve student achievement in mathematics nationally, this study will be grounded in three critical areas (motivation, affect, and social interactions), which are essential to both student performance in mathematics and to their success in other STEM fields. Since few studies have investigated these critical areas at the high school level, this study will initiate long-term, large-scale, experience-level analysis that will advance knowledge in the field. The research will build on prior studies that suggest that students are more motivated and engaged with learning mathematics when: (1) mathematics makes sense and when students believe that they are capable of making sense of mathematics; (2) mathematics and situations in which the mathematics is set are interesting to students; (3) students feel safe and supported to take intellectual risks; (4) effort and understanding are promoted over a performance culture; and (5) students feel that they matter, their ideas and themselves as people, to their teacher and their peers. <br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, the study will develop profiles of climate characteristics that are more (or less) engaging based on observations of classroom instruction and students' behavior. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis of students' perceptions of their classroom climates and day-to-day experiences will be done. This will allow researchers to map growth in student motivation and engagement as well as how a series of in-the-moment experiences, situated within classroom climate profiles, contribute to students' tendencies to engage and perform productively in mathematics. The project will develop a mobile app to study students' experiences in the moment, building Experience Sampling Methodology (EMS.) Qualitative interviews and observations of case studies will also be used to capture students' engaged behaviors and perceptions of opportunities to become absorbed in the moment experiences. Data from these sources will complement and validate the larger-scale longitudinal analyses. Outcomes from this research will advance understanding about high school students' motivation and engagement toward mathematics. The mobile application will be supplemented by prompts, scales, and observational protocols to guide researchers in further study of in-the-moment engagement. Profiles of engaging instructional climates and profiles of high school students' growth in motivation will be used to pilot professional development for teachers of diverse student populations.

This project is supported by the STEM+C program and will advance its mission by convening a capacity-building workshop to examine the relationships between computational thinking and the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology. The workshop and associated convenings will bring together key researchers, educators, curriculum developers, and education policy makers to discuss educational issues and priorities related to the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology at the K-16 level. The project will pursue the following outcomes: (1) Identification of key issues relating to the teaching and learning of synthetic biology and computational thinking in K-16 education; (2) Examination of the potential ethical issues associated with synthetic biology; and (3) Development of a framework that will allow researchers to articulate possible interactions between biodesign in their future research, and applications. It is expected that these outcomes will provide a framework for student learning and teaching of biodesign, the design of learning tools and lab spaces, and discussion points around ethics.  The project will also host a conference panel that will be streamed online for public dissemination during and after the workshop. <br/><br/>The workshop will bring together for the first time science educators, learning scientists, computer science educators, biodesigners and artists, and science center and community laboratory directors who have expertise in biology, design, computing, and K-16 education to articulate key issues and topics that take into account the complex ways these different areas intersect. Based on recent commercial developments, it is clear that design and biology can be integrated and computational thinking can play a central role in linking them. So far, researchers and educators in computational thinking and synthetic biology have conducted research and development in isolation from one another, often publishing in different journals without the benefit of knowing how their work intersects. Likewise, biology education researchers have been subdivided into those focusing on synthetic biology applications and those focusing on attitudes about bioengineering in science education. This workshop will bridge the divides and promote discussions among these groups in order to determine how biology, design, and computational design can intersect in synthetic biology. The workshop is intended to promote a greater understanding of opportunities and challenges associated with computational thinking, synthetic biology and biodesign that will prepare student audiences for a world in which biology-based design solutions to problems in health, energy, and the environment will be a part of their 21st-century STEM education.  Among the issues to be discussed are the following: 1. Learning: What do we need to know about student prior understanding about biology and computational thinking at different age levels? What are promising instructional approaches? What tools could be used for assessment? How much do students need to know about biology and computational thinking before engaging with synthetic biology? 2. Teaching: What are appropriate activities that are accessible and feasible for K-16 students? What is the best way to engage teachers to broaden their participation in implementing synthetic biology education? What prior knowledge is needed for teachers to feel ready to teach synthetic biology? How can teachers connect with one another to share best practices? What are the main differences between a computational and synthetic approach to biology and traditional life sciences education? 3. Tools: What kind of laboratory, synthesis, analysis and simulation frameworks do we need to design to support synthetic biology activities? How much training or exposure to the tools is required for a teacher to feel empowered to use them in the classroom? How easy are the tools to access and use? What can be learned from the design of interfaces and coding environments to support computational thinking in synthetic biology? How can we lower tool costs so that more students can engage with synthetic biology? 4. Spaces: Where are the types of environments that can host learning opportunities for biodesign, whether classrooms, community labs or competitions? How can we create better connections between these learning spaces? What new spaces can be cultivated for synthetic biology activities that are not being considered now? 5. Ethics: What are the pressing critical issues in biodesign? How do these issues affect society, specific populations, and the environment? What are the best ways to engage students in these discussions? How can discourse around these topics be sustained? 6. Safety and Security: What are main safety and security concerns in biodesign, and what concerns can we expect to emerge over time? How best to engage students in discussions? What best practices need to be followed in the classroom to keep students and teachers safe? Are students empowered to be safety advocates after completing the activities? What kind of considerations are necessary when computational designs (i.e., DNA constructs, genetic circuits) move from software to wetware and realized with lab activities?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preparing future generations of scientists is crucial if the United States is to remain competitive in a technology-focused economy. The biological sciences are of particular importance for addressing some of today's complex problems, such as sustainability and food production, biofuels, and carbon dioxide and its effect on our environment. Although knowledge in the life sciences is of critical importance, this is an area in which there are significantly fewer studies examining students' conceptions than in physics and chemistry. The goal of this project is to help middle school students, particularly in rural and underserved areas, develop deep scientific knowledge and knowledge of the practices and routines of science.  A major strength of Bio-Sphere is the inclusion of hands-on design and engineering in biology, a field in which there are fewer instances of curricula that integrate engineering design at the middle school level. The units will enable an in-depth, cohesive understanding of science content, and Bio-Sphere will be disseminated nationally and internationally through proactive outreach to teachers as well as scholarly publications.<br/><br/>This project addresses the need to inculcate deep learning of complex science by bringing complex socio-scientific issues into middle school classrooms, and providing students with instructional materials that allow them to practice science as scientists do.  Research teams will develop, iteratively refine and evaluate an innovative learning environment called Bio-Sphere.  Bio-Sphere combines the strengths of hands-on design and engineering, engages students in the practices of science, and fosters learning of complex science issues, especially among underserved populations.  Each Bio-Sphere unit presents a complex science issue in the form of a design challenge that students solve by conducting experiments, using visualizations in an electronic textbook, and connecting with the community. The units, aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, provide greater coherence, continuity, and sustained instruction focused on uncovering and integrating key ideas over long periods of time. The project will follow a design-based research methodology. In Phase 1, the Bio-Sphere materials will be developed. Phase 2 will consist of studies in Wisconsin schools to generate existence proofs, i.e., examining enactments with respect to the designed objectives to understand how a design works. Phase 3 studies will focus on practical implementation: how to bring this innovative design to life in very different classroom contexts and without the everyday support of the design team, and will be conducted in rural schools in Alabama and North Carolina."

The researchers will build the first co-creative learning companion, Cai, that will scaffold students with pedagogical strategies that include making use of learner code to illustrate abstraction and modularity, suggesting new code to scaffold new concepts, providing help and hints, and explaining its decisions. This work will directly address the national need to develop computing literacy as a core STEM skill.<br/><br/>The proposed work brings together an experienced interdisciplinary team to investigate the hypothesis that adding a co-creative learning companion to an expressive computer science learning environment will improve students' computer science learning (as measured by code sophistication and concept knowledge), positive attitudes towards computing (self-efficacy and motivation), and engagement (focused attention and involvement during learning). The iterative design and development of the co-creative learning companion will be based on studies of human collaboration in EarSketch classrooms, the findings in the co-creative literature and virtual agents research, and the researchers' observations of EarSketch use in classrooms. This work will address the following research questions: 1) What are the foundational pedagogical moves that a co-creative learning companion for expressive programming should perform?; 2) What educational strategies for a co-creative learning companion most effectively scaffold learning, favorable attitudes toward computing, and engagement?; and 3) In what ways does a co-creative learning companion in EarSketch increase computer science learning, engagement, and positive attitudes toward computer science when deployed within the sociocultural context of a high school classroom?

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This Innovations in Development project will research and produce science media based on the role that interest, motivations, identify, and values play in engaging diverse, millennial audiences in a dynamic media environment.  Using a design-based research approach the project team will develop Millennial Science Media Engagement Profiles (a set of categories describing different audience types who engage with science media in different ways).  It will design and test science media content (text, audio, graphics, video), placement and platform use for millennials; and make conclusions around science media storytelling and outreach tactics that spark interest and engagement, the precursors to learning. Broader impacts include contributing significant new knowledge about millennials interest and engagement in science while they are at a stage in life making critical career decisions.  It will also provide a model for other science media producers providing new protocols for creating targeted digital media for this specific audience.  And further impacts include reaching a large national audience through social media.  The project is a collaboration between KQED and researchers at Texas Tech.<br/><br/>The research will focus on the distinctive experience and interest of ""millennial"" science consumers.  It builds on a previously funded national survey and series of focus groups with millennials looking at their science media preferences versus other generations.  With these survey results this project will build profiles of millennial audiences based on two factors:  level of science curiosity and level of science media engagement. The researchers will use a previously validated Science Curiosity Scale.  The Millennial Profiles will be validated in two ways:  through performance-based survey questions and through internet audience behavior analysis using existing digital analysis tools.  KQED will produce different science media content and send it to certain groups conducting A/B testing to validate profiles online.  The profile assumptions will continue to be tested until the team can effectively predict the kinds of science content that different profile groups prefer.  The research will use a study protocol used in other domains to bridge the gap between lab and real-world settings.  The protocol involves four steps:  initial hypothesis development; ante experimental simulation; real-world communication; and ex post experimental simulations.

The RESPeCT project is developing, implementing, and studying an innovative and sustainable solution to critical problems of national importance--the unacceptable number of K-6 students who are failing to develop a rudimentary understanding of science, and the clear and persistent achievement gaps in students' understanding of science. The RESPeCT project builds on and puts into practice a successful videocase-based, analysis-of-practice professional development approach, in combination with a leadership development component, for Kindergarten through sixth grade teachers in a high-needs district. Over the five year life of the project, RESPeCT is developing a cadre of 42 K-6 Teacher Leaders, with support from CPP science and mathematics faculty, and these Teacher Leaders will sustain and lead future RESPeCT professional development efforts to reach all K-6 teachers in PUSD, supporting the teaching of challenging science content for all students. The RESPeCT Project directly benefits 168 teachers (30% of PUSD elementary teachers) and over 7,500 K-6 students and is transforming the way science is taught and learned in PUSD. Ultimately, all 511 elementary PUSD teachers and their students will benefit from the RESPeCT project. PUSD is designing a fiscal plan to continue and sustain the RESPeCT PD program and partnerships with CPP faculty far beyond the life of the project. The RESPeCT research team employs a rigorous research design, including a control group of teachers, to examine the impact of the RESPeCT professional development on PUSD students, teachers (including Teacher Leaders) and CPP faculty.  RESPeCT is an Implementation project in the Current Issues Related to STEM Content focal area.<br/><br/>A major contribution of the RESPeCT project is the development of videocases and shared curriculum materials aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) that integrate selected Common Core State Standards (CCSS) from Mathematics and English language arts (ELA) to empower teachers to teach science while relieving pressures to focus solely on mathematics and ELA. The development of fourteen modules related to life, physical, and earth and space science, concentrated within two cross-cutting concepts (energy & matter and stability & change) from the NGSS and incorporating mathematical and ELA standards is a major component of this project. The materials will be available to districts and teachers across the country. In addition, the RESPeCT project includes professional development for university faculty in leading elementary teacher learning communities. Insights into teaching and learning gained by university faculty is helping science, mathematics, and education faculty reform courses for science and mathematics majors and preservice teachers. RESPeCT serves as a national NSF-MSP model for broad-based collaborations that transform science teaching and learning. The project has special relevance for motivating and supporting teachers who serve students from underrepresented groups."

The target audiences in this project are middle and high school teachers and their students in a broad range of settings: two urban districts, an inner-ring suburb, and three rural districts. The project utilizes existing citizen science programs as springboards for professional development for teachers during an intensive summer workshop. The project curriculum helps teachers use student participation in citizen science to engage them in the full complement of science practices; from asking questions, to conducting independent research, to sharing findings. Through district professional learning communities (PLCs), teachers work with district and project staff to support and demonstrate project implementation. As students and their teachers engage in project activities, the project team is addressing two key research questions: 1) What is the nature of instructional practices that promote student engagement in the process of science?, and 2) How does this engagement influence student learning, with special attention to the benefits of engaging in research presentations in public, high profile venues? Key contributions of the project are stronger connections between a) ecology-based citizen science programs, STEM curriculum, and students' lives and b) science learning and disciplinary literacy in reading, writing and math.<br/><br/>Research design and analysis are focused on understanding how professional development that involves citizen science and independent investigations influences teachers' classroom practices and student learning. The research utilizes existing instruments to investigate teachers' classroom practices, and student engagement and cognitive activity: the Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation and Classroom Observation Protocol, and Inquiring into Science Instruction Observation Protocol. These instruments are used in classroom observations of a stratified sample of classes whose students represent the diversity of the participating districts. Curriculum resources for each citizen science topic, cross-referenced to disciplinary content and practices of the NGSS, include 1) a bibliography (books, web links, relevant research articles); 2) lesson plans and student science journals addressing relevant science content and background on the project; and 3) short videos that help teachers introduce the projects and anchor a digital library to facilitate dissemination. Impacts beyond both the timeframe of the project and the approximately 160 teachers who will participate are supported by curriculum units that address NGSS life science topics, and wide dissemination of these materials in a variety of venues. The evaluation focuses on outcomes of and satisfaction with the summer workshop, classroom incorporation, PLCs, and student learning. It provides formative and summative findings based on qualitative and quantitative instruments, which, like those used for the research, have well-documented reliability and validity. These include the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument to assess teacher beliefs; the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol to assess teacher practices; the Standards Assessment Inventory to assess PLC quality; and the Scientific Attitude Inventory to assess student attitudes towards science. Project deliverables include 1) curriculum resources that will support engagement in five existing citizen science projects that incorporate standards-based science content; 2) venues for student research presentations that can be duplicated in other settings; and 3) a compilation of teacher-adapted primary scientific research articles that will provide a model for promoting disciplinary literacy.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The Multimedia Immersion (MI) project  will develop, pilot, and evaluate a nine-week STEM-rich multimedia production course for high school students. MI will make important contributions to the field through its efforts to design and evaluate the promises and challenges of a nine-week multimedia curriculum in multiple urban high schools. The MI course will engage teams of students to develop a personally and socially relevant storyline that guides their use of accessible audio and video technologies to create a five-minute animated video. To develop student STEM experience and provide technical support, the project will provide guidance and learning experiences in engineering (e.g., criteria, constraints, optimization, tradeoffs), science (e.g. sound, light, energy, mechanics) and multimedia technologies (e.g., computer based audio production, video editing and visualizations through animatics (i.e., shooting a succession of storyboards with a soundtrack). <br/> <br/>Because the curriculum situates engineering and science learning in the context of multimedia production, there are natural synergies with several existing high school courses including engineering design, audio/video media production, and multimedia technology. Although these courses are typically electives in high school, developing a 5-minute animated short on a topic of interest may encourage girls and students from underrepresented groups to select this course over other electives. MI will impact 10 teachers and approximately 250 high school students per year. The project will result in the following resources: nine-week curricular unit (multimedia, science, engineering); assessments to monitor student learning of science, engineering and technology (design logs); and research on changes in student knowledge, interest). Project resources will be disseminated to teachers, researchers, and curriculum and professional development providers via conference presentations, publications, and online webinars. <br/><br/>The MI project builds on student familiarity and interest in music, video and technology to promote an: (1) understanding of engineering design and physics and (2) an appreciation of the fundamental role of STEM in popular culture. Project evaluation will be conducted using student surveys and an examination of work products in conjunction with implementation challenges and successes to generate evidence for the feasibility and utility of a high school multimedia course that explicitly addresses science and engineering learning. Project evaluation will use student design logs as a window into student design processes and conceptual understanding. Student design logs are an essential feature of MI curriculum design. With an appropriate structure, these design logs can inform teaching, afford an opportunity for students to reflect on their own work, and provide evidence of student thinking and learning for assessment purposes. Using student design logs as a window into students' design process and conceptual understanding is an important contribution to the engineering education community which has few options for measuring student knowledge in ways that are consistent with the hands-on, iterative nature of the design process."

First, as the school-aged population continues to grow more racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse, ELLs can now be found in virtually every school in the nation. Second, the science and mathematics education landscape has changed significantly resulting from the new visions in these fields, and the challenges posed by the new academic standards for all students. Third, the need to integrate new knowledge and perspectives from the language arts with knowledge from science and mathematics learning, instruction, and assessment has surfaced as a critical component of the potential strategies to be employed in addressing ELLs' current science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education situation from pre-K-12 grades. The key challenges today include both enabling educators to better support this student subpopulation, as well as increasing the number and quality of research activities focused on how best to support ELLs' success in these subjects. In response to this challenge, the Board on Science Education (BOSE) of the National Academies of Sciences will conduct a consensus study focused on identifying instructional practices and professional development approaches for teachers, as well as the policies that are needed to support ELLs' accomplishments  in science and mathematics education. The study will synthesize a wide range of research literatures relevant to improving ELLs' STEM learning, and provide a comprehensive understanding of how best to simultaneously support English language development and deep learning in the context of new and more challenging standards in science and mathematics. The study will also provide a framework for future research that can help to identify the most relevant and pressing questions for the field, as well as increase the number and quality of proposed research activities focused on ELLs in STEM. <br/><br/>To conduct the consensus study, BOSE will convene a multidisciplinary committee of experts who will synthesize the most relevant research on related subjects. The committee will include professionals in the fields of science and mathematics education, curriculum development, learning and instruction, linguistics, and assessment to address key sets of research questions: (1) Based on research-informed and field-tested models, strategies, and approaches, what are promising approaches to support ELLs (including ELLs with disabilities) in learning STEM? Given the diversity within the ELLs' population, what has worked, for whom, and under what conditions? What can be learned from these models and what additional research is needed to understand what makes them effective? What commonly used approaches may be less effective?; (2) What is the role of teachers in supporting the success of ELLs in STEM? What is known about the biases teachers may bring to their classrooms with ELLs and how these can be effectively addressed? What kinds of curriculum, professional development experiences, and assessment are needed in order for STEM teachers to improve their support for ELLs in STEM?; (3) How can assessments in STEM (both formative and summative) be designed to reflect the new content standards and to be appropriate for ELLs? What assessment accommodations might need to be considered?; (4) How do policies and practices at the national, state, and local level constrain or facilitate efforts to better support ELLs in STEM (including policies related to identification of students)? What kinds of changes in policy and practice are needed?; and (5) What are the gaps in the current research base and what are the key directions for research, both short-term and long-term? The committee will work over a 30-month period to synthesize relevant research literature and prepare a final consensus report, including results, conclusions, and recommendations. The study will address an issue of national importance and will inform future research on challenges directly related to ELLs, diversity, and equity in STEM education. This issue is particularly relevant to programs such as Discovery Research K-12 that supports efforts that reflect the needs of the increasingly diverse population, and Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers, which supports strategies for recruiting and selecting participants from identified groups currently underrepresented in STEM professions, careers, and education pathways. The report will target a broad audience of stakeholders, including teachers, school district administrators, researchers, congressional staff, and federal agencies that fund educational research and set policies related to ELLs."

Researchers at Boston College, Iowa State, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Educational Development Center will train environmental science teachers to use a recent scientific discovery, artificial transparent soil to integrate computational environmental science into their teaching practice. Artificial transparent soil allows for the visualization of roots in living plants and allows scientists, teachers, and students to study root structures and soil ecology on a microscopic level. Mechanically, the artificial soil mimics real soil, supports root structures, holds suspended minerals, can be colonized by microorganisms, and exchanges gases like soil. The project investigators will bring this new computational technology to environmental science teachers in public schools in Massachusetts, Iowa, and Colorado. Teachers will learn how to integrate computational science into their environmental science curriculum and will be immersed in an interdisciplinary training program where they will learn the physics, chemistry, and biological principles underlying artificial transparent soil, while also learning how to program and code micro-electronics and conduct scientific experiments with their students.

(2) How do teachers and the curriculum design help teachers navigate the tensions of infusing computation while also ensuring STEM content and what computational science and scientific practices do teachers utilize in their teaching?, and (3) What are the supports, both in terms of professional development and as a part of the curriculum materials themselves, that need to be provided to teachers to support them in integrating and adapting the program for their classroom? The project team will utilize design-based research approach that will involve classroom observations, interviews with teachers, and surveys to evaluate how and in what ways teachers adapted the materials to their classrooms. The project team aims to develop case studies of teachers across contexts that will serve as the basis for future professional development. The project team will recruit teachers who teach in under-resourced schools, teach youth of color, or teach in schools with a high percentage of underrepresented populations in STEM fields.  The project team has existing partnerships with school districts throughout Massachusetts (Boston Public, Waltham, Springfield, and Lawrence), Colorado, and Iowa.  The research and evaluation of this program will enable, educators and teachers, to implement best practices regarding the infusion of computational science using a holistic interdisciplinary to STEM instruction. Further, given the limited work, and general lack of computational knowledge amongst the nations' environmental science teachers this work will provide some of the first insights into how to support science teachers to use coding and computation in their classrooms. This work will be shared with a wide range of audiences through public festivals, teacher conferences, and traditional academic research conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will collaborate with Indigenous communities to create educational resources serving Inupiaq middle school students and their teachers. Research activities take place in Northwest Alaska.  Senior personnel will travel to rural communities to collaborate with and support participants. The visits demonstrate University of Alaska Fairbanks's commitment to support pathways toward STEM careers, community engagement in research, science teacher recruitment and preparation, and STEM career awareness for Indigenous and rural pre-college students. Pre-service teachers who access to the resources and findings from this project will be better prepared to teach STEM to Native students and other minorities and may be more willing to continue careers as science educators teaching in settings with Indigenous students. The project will contribute to a greater understanding of effective natural science teaching and science career recruitment of minority students. The project's participants and the pre-college students they teach will be part of the pipeline into science careers for underrepresented Native students in Arctic communities. The project will build on partnerships outside of Alaska serving other Indigenous populations and will expand outreach associated with NSF's polar science investments.  <br/><br/>CCPM will build on cultural knowledge systems and NSF polar research investments to address science themes relevant to Inupiat people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years. An Inupiaq scholar will conduct project research and guide collaboration between Indigenous participants and science researchers using the Inupiaq research methodology known as Katimarugut (meaning ""we are meeting"").  The project research and development will engage 450 students in grades 6-8 and serves 450 students (92% Indigenous) and 11 teachers in the remote Arctic. There are two broad research hypotheses. The first is that the project will build knowledge concerning STEM research practices by accessing STEM understandings and methodologies embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems; engaging Indigenous communities in project development of curricular resources; and bringing Arctic science research aligned with Indigenous priorities into underserved classrooms. The second is that classroom implementation of resources developed using the CCPM will improve student attitudes toward and engagement with STEM and increase their understandings of place-based science concepts.

The conference will bring together 35 participants, including physical and life science educators, education researchers, and computer science educators as well as representatives from other disciplines who have worked on integrating computational thinking in their secondary school disciplinary courses and who have practical experience with the challenges and opportunities afforded by computational education and the critical competencies and skills needed to prepare students in future computational science careers. The conference will develop a set of open research questions whose answers will provide evidence for the effectiveness of computational thinking integration and to articulate the common features of the computational thinking skills and competencies developed by the computer science professional community and by the physics, physical sciences, and computer science education communities. Having students develop computational thinking competencies will have a major influence on college and career readiness and the enhancement of the nation's computational workforce. The results of the conference will provide advice to secondary school educators about how to develop STEM and computer science education programs that foster the development of computational thinking for students, potentially affecting millions of students across the nation. This project is in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letter, DRK12: Advancing STEM + Computing (17-149) and is supported by the STEM + Computing Program that advances research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>Computational thinking includes the use of computational skills and methods to articulate and solve essential problems in a range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and to aid in developing a deeper understanding of core disciplinary ideas and crosscutting concepts to solve problems that will benefit society. The conference participants will identify similarities and differences among definitions of computational thinking and formulate a series of education research questions focusing on scaffolding computational thinking development in students (with an emphasis on secondary school physics and physical science students), professional development for teachers and faculty members, and assessing the effectiveness of various strategies in enhancing students' skills in computational thinking. The research questions will also address how computational thinking enhances students' understanding of the physics and physical sciences disciplines. Topics will include the vertical alignment of secondary STEM curricula that integrate computational thinking, appropriate learning progressions, standards, and assessment of the effectiveness of the curricula in fostering computational thinking and deepening the understanding of STEM content. The participants will also discuss how to develop a STEM + computer science education culture that fosters the pervasive implementation of computational thinking that has broad application to students. The project will make use of existing secondary school frameworks for computational thinking as articulated by elements of the 2012 Framework for K-12 Science Education and the 2017 CSK12 Framework at the secondary level, similar frameworks at the higher education level, and the early results of education research into integrated computational thinking in several NSF-funded projects. Direct outcomes from this conference will include an analysis of alignment of content, skills, and assessments/research metrics to enhance the existing projects, as well as a set of open research questions that will guide funding programs and computational thinking education research efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By leveraging pre-existing social structures, skill sets, and engagement in quilting, the researchers hope to help participants develop computer science and computational thinking knowledge and skills. The long-term goal is to broaden public awareness of computational thinking and build links between computer science and other areas of interest. By leveraging the social structure and existing skills held by practicing quilters, the workshops have the potential to reach an audience of millions of quilters around the nation and worldwide, the majority of whom are adult women.<br/><br/>The research will be developed and tested with two groups: the Orlando Modern Quilt Guild in Orlando, FL, and an informally gathered quilting class in the Worcester, MA area. Outcomes for the project include workshop materials that can be used in a variety of quilting group contexts nationwide, a deeper understanding of the processes and mechanisms for adult computer science education through crafts, and evaluation of the pilot workshop focused on the impact on participants' engagement, self-identity, and learning for computational thinking. The research especially focuses on leveraging pre-existing knowledge, interests, and social structures to draw connections to computational thinking, and studying how this impacts participants' self-described identity, attitude, and engagement with computer science. The project also assesses a novel method for teaching computational thinking that has potential for broad applicability in a variety of social and creative hobbies. Participants will use and modify generative design software that creates quilt designs and, in doing so, learn how creative interests can be expanded through computer science.

All PD sessions will be recorded for interaction analysis to identify variations in coaching and teacher participation and the influences of such variation on teacher learning. Repeated measures of teachers' conceptions of argumentation will be given over 3 years as a measure of teacher learning. An observation protocol will be developed and used to measure teacher talk and its change over time. A sub-sample of teachers' classrooms will be video recorded to produce a longitudinal record for interaction analyses to link teacher talk to patterns of student argumentation. The third year of the project will add measures of student learning and link them to variations in teacher practice.

The problem is particularly acute at the elementary level, where many teachers have limited science background and many have not taught science before.  The project will collect existing empirical literature for two science topics and synthesize it with an often-overlooked resource -- practice-based knowledge.  The resulting knowledge resources will be made available to teachers on a website.  The resource will support elementary teachers as they plan for science instruction, and to enable them to productively adapt their own science materials to improve student learning.

(2) What factors must be taken into account in applying the knowledge collection and synthesis method across science topics? (3) What affordances and limitations does the web-based resource present for teachers primarily, and for teacher educators and instructional materials developers? (4) How does access to content-specific teaching knowledge affect teachers' planning and instruction?  Content-specific teaching knowledge will be collected through literature reviews (for empirical knowledge) and a series of iterative, on-line expert panels (to gather practice-based knowledge).

SciStarter is a repository of over 1,500 citizen science (CS) projects. Through prior research, SciStarter 2.0 tools were developed which can be used to study and coordinate recruitment and retention strategies across projects. Coordinated management has the potential to deepen volunteer learning and growth and benefit project goals because it can address across-project skew (CS volunteers involved in multiple projects), evolving motivations, seasonal gaps, untapped synergies across projects, and other unanticipated factors that cannot be addressed via management within project silos. The project will increase the capacity of citizen science projects to achieve their myriad scientific, learning and conservation goals through enhanced coordination of volunteer management, facilitated by evidence-based guidance from the SciStarter's User's Manual for Project Owners. The findings of the research will guide project design and implementation towards synergies that increase the capacity of projects to generate scientific, learning, and conservation outcomes. <br/><br/>Research about citizen scientists has focused on within-project assessments and comparisons of projects, but few have examined dynamics of recruitment, retention, and movement of individuals across projects.

(DBR blends empirical educational research with the theory-driven design of learning environments.) Existing or new educational activities that appear to embody key characteristics defined in the framework will be tested with public audiences for their impact on visitors. Researchers and educators will determine how different characteristics of the educational activities defined in the framework affect the outcomes. The activities will be modified and tested iteratively until the investigators achieve close alignment between framework and impacts.. The project team will continue the design-based research approach both to examine groups of activities in which synergies can have impacts beyond single interactions as well as to examine varied ways of training facilitators who can also significantly affect outcomes.

The project targets science teachers (chemistry, physics, biology, and earth science) who teach in a high school that includes refugees from Myanmar, Central America, and Africa. Roughly 20% of the students are classified as ELs, representing almost 20 different linguistic groups, including a variety of Asian, Spanish, and Arabic languages. The fundamental issue that the project seeks to address is the design of science learning environments to facilitate ELs' learning in linguistically diverse high school classrooms. Research on science education for ELs has recommended several effective teaching approaches, such as building on students' diverse and rich resources, engaging students in authentic science learning practices, and encouraging and valuing flexible use of multiple languages. However, previously most research has focused on teaching speakers of Spanish in elementary and middle school level science classrooms in which a majority of ELs speak the same language. Furthermore, while many PD programs supporting science education for ELs provide a short-term workshop and/or newly designed curriculum and curriculum guide, there is a lack of PD models that engage teachers in a sustained community of practice through collaboration between researchers and teachers. <br/><br/>The project's primary goal includes broadening participation with direct impact on 14 science teachers, who will impact over 2000 students, including over 450 ELs, during the project implementation period. The project provides a sustained model of the PD program which further impacts EL students of teachers who participated in the various phases of the project. The project has a potential to make an impact on ELs and high school science teachers of ELs in three different ways. First, by generating PD materials that include effective teaching materials and instructional practices for ELs, which can be used by other educators situated in similar educational contexts. Second, by giving presentations and publish papers that communicate findings of the project to academic communities. These outputs can impact other researchers who would like to design PD programs to foster ELs' science learning. Third, by implementing the developed and tested PD program in a larger scale. The implementation of the project will build capacity to conduct a larger PD project to impact more teachers and students. These anticipated outputs and outcomes will provide valuable resources for researcher and practitioners looking to support ELs' science learning and steps forward to equity.

Although ELLs are the fastest-growing demographic group in classrooms, many are historically underserved in mainstream science classrooms, particularly those from underrepresented minority groups. The significant increase of ELLs at public schools poses a challenge to science teachers in linguistically diverse classrooms as they try to support and engage all students in learning science. The proposed project will respond to this urgent need by investigating the potential benefits of interactive, dynamic visualization technologies, including simulations, animations, and visual models, in supporting science learning for all middle school students, including ELLs. This project will also identify design principles for developing such technology, develop additional ways to support student learning, and provide new guidelines for effective science teachers' professional development that can assist them to better serve students from diverse language backgrounds. The project has the potential to transform traditional science instruction for all students, including underserved ELLs, and to broaden their participation in science. <br/><br/>In collaboration with eighth grade science teachers from two low-income middle schools in North Carolina, the project will focus on three objectives: (1) develop, test, and refine four open-source, web-based inquiry units featuring dynamic visualizations on energy and matter concepts in physical and life sciences, aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS); (2) investigate how dynamic visualizations can engage eighth-grade ELLs and native-English-speaking students in science practices and improve their understanding of energy and matter concepts; and (3) investigate which scaffolding approaches can help maximize ELLs' learning with visualizations. Research questions include: (1) Which kinds of dynamic visualizations (simulations, animations, visual models) lead to the best learning outcomes for all students within the four instructional science units?; (2) Do ELLs  benefit more from visualizations (or particular kinds of visualizations) than do native-English-speaking students?; and (3) What kinds of additional scaffolding activities (e.g., critiquing arguments vs. generating arguments) are needed by ELLs in order to achieve the greatest benefit? The project will use design-based research and mixed-methods approaches to accomplish its research objectives and address these questions. Furthermore, it will help science teachers develop effective strategies to support students' learning with visualizations. Products from this project, including four NGSS-aligned web-based inquiry units, the visualizations created for the project, professional development materials, and scaffolding approaches for teachers to use with ELLs, will be freely available through a project website and multiple professional development networks. The PI will collaborate with an advisory board of experts to develop the four instructional units, visualizations, and scaffolds, as well as with the participating teachers to refine these materials in an iterative fashion.  Evaluation of the materials and workshops will be provided each year by the advisory board members, and their feedback will be used to improve design and implementation for the next year.  The advisory board will also provide summative evaluation of student learning outcomes and will assess the success of the teachers' professional development workshops."

The approach will include use of materials addressing student motivational processes and how to support them, evaluation tools to measure student motivational competencies, lesson planning tools, and instruments for teacher self-evaluation. The translation to practice will include recognition of student diversity and consider ways to facilitate context-specific integration of disciplinary and motivational knowledge in practice. The project will focus on middle school science classrooms because this period is an important motivational bridge between elementary and secondary science learning. This project will enhance understanding of teacher pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in that it frames knowledge about supporting motivational competencies in science as PCK rather than general pedagogical knowledge. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.   <br/><br/>This early stage design and development project will iteratively develop and study a model of teacher professional learning that will help middle school science teachers create, modify, and implement instruction that integrates support for students' motivational competencies with the science practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas specified in science curriculum standards.  A design-based research approach will be used to develop and test four resources teachers will use to explicitly include attention to student motivational competencies in their lesson planning efforts.  The resources will include: 1) educational materials about students' motivational processes with concrete examples of how to support them; 2) easy-to-implement student evaluation tools for teachers to gauge students' motivational competencies; 3) planning tools to incorporate motivational practices into science lesson planning; and 4) instruments for teacher self-evaluation. A collaborative group of educational researchers will partner with science teachers from multiple school districts having diverse student populations to jointly develop the professional learning approach and resources. This project will contribute to systemic change by moving motivational processes from an implicit element of educating students, to an explicit and intentional set of strategies teachers can enact.  Research questions will focus on how teachers respond to the newly developed professional learning model, and how students respond to instruction developed through implementing the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  This study will contribute to these goals by providing empirical evidence about how and under what circumstances science museums, science centers, and other designed settings for informal science education (ISE) can change so that they will reach more diverse audiences with the full range of their educational activities. This study will deepen understanding of equity norms and practices at ISE organizations, as well as the internal and contextual factors that shape them.<br/><br/>The project builds on a unique opportunity provided by the widely known and critically acclaimed exhibition ""RACE: Are We So Different?""  After traveling to dozens of museums and science centers, and being seen by over three million people, RACE is returning home to the Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) where it was created. Strand 1 of this study will examine the processes underlying organizational change at SMM as it attempts to use RACE to leverage organization-wide change. In Strand 2, the project team will compare the experiences of ISE organizations around the country that hosted RACE, focusing on the conditions that influence reflection and lead to (or prevent) lasting impact. These two studies will inform the design of Strand 3: a national survey on equity norms and practices, and the potential for equity-related change, in designed settings for ISE. Four research questions guide all project activities: 1)How can such Informal Science Education organizations leverage an unusual event, such as a traveling exhibition, to catalyze and sustain change in their equity-related norms and practices? 2) How and when does the deep reflection required to change entrenched norms and practices manifest itself in ISE organizations that attempt to change their equity norms and practices? 3) What contextual factors support or oppose the achievement and maintenance of organization-wide changes in equity norms and practices? 4) How common are these supportive and opposing conditions in the institutional field of museums and science centers, and how prevalent are different norms and practices related to equity?"

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The project is responsive to the societal challenges emerging from the nation's diverse and rapidly changing student demographics, including the rise of English language learners (ELLs), the fastest growing student population (see, for example, ""U.S. school enrollment hits majority-minority milestone"", Education Week, February 1, 2015). ELLs have grown exponentially: 1 in 5 students (21%) in the nation spoke a language other than English at home in 2011. The project's main purpose is to develop instructional materials for a year-long, fifth grade curriculum for all students, including ELLs. The planned curriculum will promote language-focused and three-dimensional science learning (through blending of science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas), aligned with the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012), the Next Generation Science Standards (Achieve, 2013), and the Conceptual Framework for Language use in the Science Classroom (Lee, Quinn & Valds, 2013). The grade-level science content will target topics, such as structure and properties of matter, matter and energy in organisms and ecosystems, and Earth's and space systems, with engineering design embedded in each topic. The language approach will emphasize analytical science tasks aimed at making sense of and constructing scientific knowledge; and receptive (listening and reading) and productive (speaking and writing) language functions. Products and research results from this project will help to reduce the science achievement gaps between ELLs and non-ELLs, and enable all students to attain higher levels of proficiency in subsequent grade levels.<br/><br/>After the curriculum has been developed and field-tested during Years 1-3, a pilot study will be conducted in Year 4 to investigate promise of effectiveness. Using a randomized controlled trial design, the pilot study will address three research questions: (1) What is the impact of the intervention on science learning and language development for all students, including ELLs and former ELLs?; (2) What is the impact of the intervention on teachers' instructional practices?; and (3) To what extent are teachers able to implement the instructional materials with fidelity? To address research question 1, a sequence of multi-level models (MLMs) in which the posttest score for each student measure (the state/district science test score, and the science score and the language score on the researcher-developed assessment) will be regressed on a dummy variable representing condition (treatment or control) and pretest covariates. To examine whether the intervention is beneficial for students of varying levels of English proficiency, subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing ELLs in the treatment group against ELLs in the control group; former ELLs in the treatment group against former ELLs in the control group; and non-ELLs in the treatment group against non-ELLs in the control group, using the same MLMs. Exploratory analyses will be employed to examine the extent to which the level of English proficiency moderates the impact of the intervention on ELLs. To address research question 2, a 2-level model (teachers as level-1, and schools as level-2) in which the post-questionnaire scale score will be regressed on a dummy variable representing condition (treatment or control) will be conducted. To address research question 3, plans are to analyze ratings on coverage, adherence, and quality of instruction from classroom observations, along with ratings on program differentiation and participant responsiveness from the implementation and feedback form."

This project's goals are to educate rural communities and youth about ocean science via setting up exhibits in unique venues such as parks, parking lots and at community gatherings as well as in local libraries. Local library staff and Girl Scouts will assist the investigators in operationalizing the community activities. The project is a collaboration between the Consortium for Leadership, Inc., Rutgers University, the University of Hawaii, Ashland University, the College of Exploration, the Girl Scout organization and some of its affiliates, the Rural Library Education Network, local museums, and the Texas State Aquarium.<br/><br/>This project will experiment with a new style of presentation called ""Pop up"" which brings in exhibits that are rapidly and easily set up in unconventional venues such as parks to get the communities' attention. From among the visitors attending the ""Pop up"" sessions, the organizers will invite those who have shown interest to attend deeper discussions of ocean science at the local library.  This deeper discussion, referred to as ""Drill down"", will involve scientists commenting from a research ship on their research activities. Cores from the ocean floor will be used to educate attendees about the history of the planet. Locations of the project venues will include rural communities that have a high population of underserved citizens. Research questions to be investigated are: 1. Do the ""Pop up"" and ""Drill down"" exercises create an effective and sustainable model for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning? 2. How does the ""Pop up/Drill down"" methodology meet the needs of partner informal science education institutions such as the libraries and Girl Scouts in fulfilling their own missions? 3.

Building on lessons learned from NYSCI's ITEST-funded Innovation Institute on participant perceptions of computer science and engineering as STEM career pathways, the project will investigate: <br/><br/>(1) How specific aspects of the program influence participant perceptions of the relevance, usefulness and accessibility of computer   science and engineering as potential academic and career pathways, and<br/>(2) Through collaboration with NYSCI's INCLUDES-funded national network of out-of-school Maker Spaces, how to adapt, implement and study the revised version of the Innovation Institute at scale in future years.<br/><br/>The proposed research will deepen understandings of factors, designs and practices that encourage and motivate students to pursue and persist in education programs or pathways that prepare them for STEM occupations. In the program, early adolescent immigrant youth will have the opportunity to deeply explore a social inequity in their community that is personally relevant to them and use the practices and problem-solving approaches of engineering and computer science to develop potential solutions for this issue.  The hypothesis is that by developing solutions to a relevant community issue, participant perceptions of the utility of using engineering and computer science approaches will increase.

This research project will be grounded in two implementations of a nine-month, out-of-school-time program, which will be organized around the theme of understanding and responding to quality of life issues in NYSCI's immediate neighborhoods through the use of computational tools to develop sustainable, high-impact solutions that benefit the community.  The project will serve a total of 50-60 youth from NYSCI's immediate community, produce and disseminate program curriculum materials, and lay the groundwork for a scale-up implementation and study of the program via the NSF INCLUDES Designing for Diversity Network. The project's early stage research strategy includes a rich variety of qualitative and quantitative measures to develop evidence of promise that the revised Innovation Institute model has significant potential for success in a scale-up to other sites.

This project documents the outreach work of field stations and explores the connections between how the outreach activities engage learners, incorporate science topics, and address science learning. By creating an Outreach Ontology, a multidimensional framework around the outreach activities, this work provides a valuable resource and reference to informal science researchers who seek to understand what informal learning projects are undertaken at field stations, and how these activities fit into the broader context of informal science learning. This project will help field stations collaborate on improving informal STEM learning activities by bringing them together to discuss their efforts and by developing a publicly available, searchable database detailing their activities.

The resulting system will be accessible and inclusive for all learners as a pedagogical tool to enhance traditional classroom instruction that includes a teacher dashboard for monitoring and assessment purposes. <br/><br/>Two primary programmatic goals include: 1) to design, develop, and iteratively refine the learning environment for 5th grade students that improves comprehension monitoring and supports science learning and 2) to increase current theoretical and practical understanding of how elementary students engage with and monitor their comprehension of informational science texts. The program will function within a self-regulated learning framework and include three key curricular units (ecosystems, Earth and human activity, from molecules to organisms) that align with Next Generation Science Standards. A systematic program of studies will be conducted starting from design-based studies in Years 1 & 2 to test digital strategy tools and game-based elements followed by experimental studies in Years 2 & 3 to examine the influence of both embedded comprehension monitoring tools and adaptive scaffolding. A mixed method measurement approach will be adopted along with an iterative program development model. Measures of content learning, metacognitive monitoring, transfer, and motivational and affect variables (e.g. self-efficacy, interest) will be targeted to inform the literature. Design studies will further examine the impact of the environment with regard to ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, ESL status, prior gaming experience, and achievement levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this Innovations and Development project, Child Trends, in collaboration with Ivanhoe Broadcast News, will expand the reach of the Child Trends News Service, and rigorously evaluate its impact on viewers.  The News Service aims to build the public's knowledge of, and appreciation for, social science research and to encourage adoption of research-informed parenting practices associated with positive child development--particularly among Latino parents. First produced in 2017 through a NSF proof of concept grant, the Child Trends News Service covers actionable, child-focused, social science research.  By featuring this research on local TV news, the project expands access to evidence-based parenting recommendations.  As of February 2018, 89 stations had subscribed to the News Service, including eight stations in the top 25 Latino-serving TV markets that reach 38% of all Hispanic TV Households in those 25 markets.  This project is a response to the challenges faced by U.S. children, of whom more than one in five live in poverty.  The focus on Latino parents is in response Latinos' increasing share of all children, and that Latino children are disproportionately poor, in comparison to their peers.  The project will examine the impact of the News Service on parents who view the news reports in their homes, as well as Latino parents viewing the News Service as part of their participation in the Abriendo Puertas (Opening Doors) community-based parenting program.  This research will contribute to the knowledge base of what we know about how people access and use science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) information across settings. <br/><br/>The overarching aim of this project is to leverage commercial television news to reach populations who have historically been underrepresented in STEM education and careers. The goals of the project are to:<br/>1. Build and manage an interdisciplinary collaborative, including news media professionals, researchers, practitioners in organizations serving at-risk families, and experts in STEM communications and Latino studies.<br/>2. Leverage mass media news outlets to deliver social science research on children to at-risk populations, with a focus on reaching Latino parents.<br/>3. Advance the field of informal STEM learning by exploring how the public interacts with actionable research on child development to inform their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors.<br/>4. Expand the reach and application of the news products through strategic outreach to other stakeholders in the child development field including programs serving under-served families.<br/>To accomplish these goals, the project will further strengthen an Advisory Panel to inform content development, study design, interpretation of findings, dissemination of study results, and the transition of the project after the NSF grant period.  The project will continue to provide eight (both in English and Spanish) stories each month to TV stations and strategically grow the reach in top Latino markets.  The editorial process will be informed by surveys of Latino parents to identify topics of interest.  Through a random-assignment impact study with local TV news audiences from diverse racial/ethnic groups, the project will evaluate the impact of the News Service.  The project will use formative research methods to refine messaging and examine the potential for repurposing the videos through a parenting program for Latino parents.<br/><br/>The Child Trends News Service seeks broader impacts in three areas: increasing the public's scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology; increasing partnerships between academia, industry, and others; and improving the well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>This project will research, design, and develop adaptive accessibility features for interactive science simulations. The proposed research will lay the foundation that advances the accessibility of complex interactives for learning and contribute to solutions to address the significant disparity in science achievement between students with and without disabilities. The PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder and collaborators at Georgia Tech, with expertise in accessible technology and design, will form the project team. The project team will conduct design-based implementation research, where adaptive accessibility features for interactive science simulations are developed through co-design with students with disabilities and their teachers. Students will include those with dyslexia, visual impairments or blindness, and students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, ranging from 5th grade through high school, and recent high school graduates. The adaptive accessibility features will be implemented within a set of PhET interactive science simulations, and allow students with disabilities to access the science simulations with alternative input devices (such as keyboards, switches, and sip-and-puff devices), alter the visual display of the simulations (changing color contrast, zoom and enlarge, and simplify), hear different auditory representations of the visual display (descriptions, sonification, and text-to-speech), and control the rate of simulated events. All features will be capable of being turned on or off and modified on-the-fly by teachers or students through a global control panel that includes curated feature sets, resulting in highly flexible, highly accessible, interactive learning resources. <br/><br/>PhET simulations are widely used in US classrooms, evidence-based, aligned with standards, and highly engaging and effective learning resources. With the proposed highly adaptive features and supporting resources, teachers will be able to quickly adapt the PhET simulations to meet the needs of many students with disabilities, simplifying the task of creating differentiated learning opportunities for students and supporting students with disabilities to engage in collaborative learning - a foundational component of a high-quality STEM education - alongside their non-disabled peers. To research, design, and develop the adaptive features and investigate their use by students, project team members will co-teach in classrooms with students with disabilities and conduct co-design activities with students, where students engage in design thinking to help design and refine the adaptive features to meet identified accessibility needs (their own and those of their peers). In addition, interviews with individual students with and without disabilities will also be conducted, to test early prototypes of individual features, to later refine the layering of the many different features, and to ensure the presence of adaptive features does not negatively impact traditional use of the simulations. The proposed work also includes surveys of teachers and students and analysis of teacher use, to refine global control features, develop curated feature sets, and develop supporting teacher resources. The project will address key questions at the heart of educational design for students with diverse needs, including how to make adaptive features that support student achievement of specific learning goals. The project will use design-based implementation research, with significant co-designing with students with disabilities (including visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or dyslexia), interviews, case studies, and classroom implementation to design and evaluate the accessibility features. This will inform new models and theories of learning with technology. The project will investigate: 1) How students engage with, use, and learn from adaptive accessibility features, 2) how adaptive accessibility features can be designed to layer harmoniously together in a learning resource, and 3) how to effectively support access to rich, dynamic feature controls and curated feature sets for intuitive classroom use by students and teachers. The project will produce 8 PhET simulations with adaptive accessibility features and supporting teacher resources. The foundational research knowledge will result in effective design and implementation of adaptive accessibility features through the analysis of student engagement, usability, and learning from accessible simulations. Additionally, the project will provide technical infrastructure, exemplars, and software for use by other STEM education technology developers. The project team will work together to create a deep understanding of how to design adaptive science simulations with practical, usable, effective accessibility, so that learners with diverse needs can advance their science content knowledge and participate in science practices alongside their peers. The work has great potential to transform STEM learning for students with disabilities and to make simulations more effective for all learners. Results will provide insight into the effectiveness of accessible simulation-based activities and their corresponding teacher materials in engaging students in science practices and learning in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students differ from their teachers--in age and gender identity, as well as racial identity, language, social class, and experience. These differences compound the complexity of communicating because implicit racial and gender biases affect teachers' orientations to seeing students' capabilities. This project will focus on (1) understanding what it is involved in communicating mathematically with students who represent and come from a range of different communities in the work of teaching and, based on this, (2) supporting teachers to do this work skillfully. This project seeks to understand and support the work of communicating mathematically across difference in ways that disrupt the marginalization of students underrepresented in mathematics. In the first phase of the project, the project will study teaching, with an eye to identifying the interactive mathematical work of teaching across difference. The second phase will involve designing and enacting specific interventions, based on progress in the first phase, to help practicing teachers shift from predominant patterns of overlooking or misinterpreting underrepresented students to focusing on students' strengths and developing fluency and attunement in hearing and talking across difference. Teaching has profound potential to support or impede students' opportunities to learn, as well as to develop their sense of themselves as capable mathematical thinkers and their interest in and persistence with mathematics in and outside of school. Teaching can broaden how mathematics is represented in school and can directly include rather than marginalize students. Project results will help focus teacher education development on these crucial skills, potentially increasing diverse participation in STEM education in profound and far reaching ways. This project is supported by the EHR Core Research Program, which supports fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>This project seeks to identify how a special kind of mathematical fluency in action might contribute to improving both theory and practice with respect to the mathematical work of teaching across difference. The project team will analyze videotaped lessons grades 4-8 in a sample of classrooms with significant racial and linguistic diversity. The focus will be on listening to, interpreting, talking with, and responding to students to identify patterns in the demands of such interactive mathematical work. Analysis will focus on characterizing what mathematical fluency and attunement to students might mean and entail in practice. In addition, we will observe and document fifth grade and other mathematics instruction, similarly focusing on communicative work across difference. For the additional data collection, the project will interview samples of students in classrooms to learn how they are experiencing and interpreting their teachers' mathematical communication and interactions. The project will offer specific opportunities for teachers to extend their ability to do this interactive mathematical work and will develop and use tools for tracking their evolving mathematical fluency and attunement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When studies are large scale, this analysis is challenging in part because it is time-consuming to review and code large quantities of video. For example, hundreds of hours of videotaped interaction between students working in an after-school program for advancing computational thinking and engineering learning for Latino/a students. This project is exploring the use of computer-assisted methods for video analysis to support manual coding by researchers. The project is adapting procedures used for computer-aided diagnosis systems for medical systems. The computer-assisted process creates summaries that can then be used by researchers to identify critical events and to describe patterns of activities in the classroom such as students talking to each other or writing during a small group project. Creating the summaries requires analyzing video for facial recognition, motion, color and object identification. The project will investigate what parts of student participation and teaching can be analyzed using computer-assisted video analysis. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program, the STEM+C program and the AISL program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The video analysis systems will provide video summarizations for specific activities which will allow researchers to use these results to quantify student participation and document teaching practices that support student learning. This will support the analysis of large volumes of video data that are often time-consuming to analyze. The video analysis system will identify objects in the scene and then use measures of distances between objects and other tracking methods to code different activities (e.g., typing, talking, interaction between the student and a facilitator).  The two groups of research questions are as follows. (1) How can human review of digital videos benefit from computer-assisted video analysis methods? Which aspects of video summarization (e.g., detected activities) can help reduce the time it takes to review the videos? Beyond audio analytics, what types of future research in video summarization can help reduce the time that it takes to review videos? (2) How can we quantify student participation using computer-assisted video analysis methods? What aspects of student participation can be accurately measures by computer-assisted video analysis methods? The video to be used for this study is drawn from a project focused on engineering and computational thinking learning for Latino/a students in an after-school setting. Hundreds of hours of video are available to be reviewed and analyzed to design and refine the system. The resulting coding will also help document patterns of engagement in the learning environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Core Partners in DEBT-M are the Education Development Center (EDC) as the lead, and the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS), the University of Pittsburgh (UPITT), and the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The project team is investigating how the opportunity gap can be addressed through a focused program of professional development that involves teachers, mathematicians, and mathematics educators as equal partners.  The context for this work is the mathematics program in grades 6-12 in PPS with around 4000 students in this grade band, more than one quarter of whom are struggling, underrepresented mathematics learners.  The target audience is the teachers of these students, as well as the IHE faculty in Core Partner institutions. The primary STEM field involves mathematics that surrounds high school algebra. Goals for the IHE partners include close alliances with the teachers in Pittsburgh and participation in the development and implementation of new experiences for the whole partnership.<br/><br/>DEBT-M's inaugural year is followed by two consecutive two-year cycles of immersive summer professional development with intensive school-year follow-up. During each year, four follow-up activities support teachers in shifting practice in the classroom and furthering the community of doers of mathematics: colloquia, monthly seminars, bi-weekly study groups, and visits by all partners to participating schools. Regarding thinking about mathematics and mathematics learning, the project team focuses on what mathematics is and how experiences have shaped teachers' perspectives. Teachers also focus on how mathematics education has shaped learner identities. DEBT-M provides experiences and opportunities to construct what they conjecture are critical perspectives, dispositions, and expertise that in turn enable all partners to collectively determine what aspects of practice to address and how to address them. The last week of each summer is focused exclusively on this collaborative, professional effort. Partners and participants together draw on their summer work and learning to make decisions about implementing classroom practices in courses with struggling students', decisions that are supported, studied, and analyzed throughout the school year with the study groups, seminars, equity fellows, etc. <br/><br/>DEBT-M includes both an external evaluation and a design-based, internal research component. The internal research study investigates, tests, and refines a set of conjectures about how school districts can, at scale, both transform teaching to embody a rigorous disciplinary approach and significantly reduce mathematics opportunity gaps that exist for African-American and low-SES students who have been systemically marginalized over time. A mixed-methods approach is used to answer the research questions, with analyses of a variety of data, including student surveys of identity and connection to teacher; PD and classroom video; teacher habits of mind assessments; district artifacts; recordings of parent-and-child focus groups; and annual interviews with teachers and school- and district-leaders. The external evaluation is designed to assess the quality of the professional development, its impact on teachers' instructional practices, and its impact on student achievement. Teachers are recruited from the one urban school district (PPS), with a focus on high schools and their feeder middle schools. <br/><br/>Products of the DEBT-M project are expected to include new professional development materials that integrate mathematical content with explicit treatment of both the practice of mathematics and the practice of  engagement for all students with a clear focus on working with marginalized students. The project team brings together instruments that assist in the diagnosis of aspects of high school settings that impact on mathematics professional development and student learning efforts."

Current research undertaken by the research team suggests that the over-simplification is related to limitations in teachers' understandings of proportional relationships. Presenting proportions in a dynamic environment offers teachers the opportunity to create key developmental understandings related to this area of mathematics. This project focuses on the creation of the initial functionality for a dynamic microworld, Proportions Playground, designed to support teachers in developing a coherent understanding of proportional reasoning. Proportions Playground is conceptualized as a tool for supporting the development of coherent understandings by allowing teachers to interact in concrete ways with otherwise abstract ideas and by allowing teachers easy access to dynamic objects and other representations. It is meant to address the significant limitations for reasoning about the relationships between measurable aspects of two objects as well as in manipulating those relationships. Building from work currently underway, Proportions Playground will explore key areas in which there are opportunities for engaging teachers in the development of a coherent and robust understanding of proportional reasoning that extends beyond the typical ""3 given, 1 unknown"" proportion problem. This approach attempts to engage teachers in an array of dynamic, visually-rich sets of tasks designed to challenge teachers' preconceptions of proportions and to strengthen their connections between proportions and related areas of mathematics. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) and EHR Core Research (ECR) Programs. the DRK-12 program supports research and development on STEM education innovations and approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The Proportions Playground project seeks to both develop a unique pilot software application for the iPad and explore how it supports teachers in developing a coherent, robust definition of proportions. The software will be designed to support either numeric manipulation (e.g., graphing software) or geometric constructions (e.g., dynamic geometry software). Specifically, for this project the mathematics of interest will include the relationships between similarity and proportion and the nature of covariation. The research will focus on how teachers are developing a robust and coherent understanding of proportions and how the dynamic environment promotes such understandings. Working with six teacher advisors, the project will develop three task sets. Using teaching experiments and individual interviews, results will be used to refine the task sets. The revised task sets will be piloted with 40 teachers. Data will be collected on participants' thinking and any changes seen in the knowledge resources they are using.

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The three-year project, Montana Models: Connecting Local and Disciplinary Practices through University-Community Partnerships, focuses on creating, implementing, and studying several learning outcomes associated with youth engagement in mathematical modeling contexts. The project builds on existing partnerships between the state's two research universities and Montana 4-H to target outreach to rural youth and bring them into a network of people who can inspire, support, and sustain STEM learning. Middle school and high school students from rural communities will be invited to a university campus for a residential modeling-based summer program l focused on mathematics and mathematical modeling. Activities at the summer program are designed to engage them in problems relevant to their own backgrounds and experiences and to honor their local funds of knowledge. <br/><br/>The primary goal of Montana Models is to use mathematical modeling as a mechanism for bringing everyday mathematical practices already present in rural communities into contact with disciplinary practices. The project focuses on the following research questions: (1) What are the everyday mathematical practices in Montana communities? (2) How can everyday mathematical practices be leveraged and brought into contact with disciplinary practices in service of mathematizing meaningful questions within the community? (3) How do youth identify and get identified with respect to mathematics and with respect to their role in the world? (4) How does participation in project activities affect participants' knowledge of mathematical practices and content? The project uses social design experimentation, a hybrid research methodology which combines the traditions of design-based research with forms of inquiry that involve collaboration among participants, researchers, and other stakeholders, such as critical ethnography. Data sources include field notes from ethnographic observations, interviews, videos of students engaging in modeling activities, artifacts that show their  mathematical work, and results from the Attitudes Towards Mathematics Inventory. Through its collaboration with 4-H, Montana Models targets outreach to rural youth across the state, especially those from groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. The project is poised to impact ways in which formal and informal educators understand the knowledge bases that are already present in rural communities and how those bases may inform, support, and sustain STEM learning. Findings and deliverables will be disseminated through a public-facing website and through the 4-H infrastructure. This infrastructure includes Montana 4-H's Clover Communication Contest that will allow participating youth to showcase their projects. Research findings will be shared through local and national conferences and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim.  Expert teachers effectively orchestrate the complex flow of ideas and products in the classroom through individual, small group, and whole class activities. In supporting the future work of teachers, this project will facilitate the classroom orchestration process through the development of an intelligent teaching assistant, implemented as a tablet-based dashboard. This will allow the teacher to delegate cognitively-demanding orchestration tasks related to classroom activities to the intelligent assistant, enabling him/her to focus on other tasks to support student learning.  Building on an existing shared-document system for middle school mathematics teachers, the proposed system will facilitate teachers in monitoring student work, assessing it, and making conclusions (e.g., indicating student progress, errors, and misconceptions) while allowing them to circulate among students who are working individually or in small groups.  Ultimately, the system will behave like an automated teaching assistant and allow teachers to be more effective and increase their job satisfaction by allowing them to concentrate on assisting learners who most need help.  <br/><br/>Building on the team's Formative Assessment with Computational Technologies (FACT) system, the development of an intelligent teaching assistant will enhance teachers' awareness of what is going on in the classroom and facilitate the cognitively-intensive tasks of orchestrating classroom activities. In the first six-month phase, the project will employ a knowledge engineering process to uncover the tacit knowledge teachers use for decision-making in managing the flow of classroom activities.  In the second phase, over two and one-half years, a series of ten comprehensive trials will be conducted to iteratively develop the cognitive policies of the system through data collection and optimizing the flow of work and ideas, carefully considering teacher input.  This knowledge will be encoded in a rule-based Artificial Intelligence where the intelligent teaching assistant can perform some of the decision-making.  Authorized by the teacher, it will send messages directly to students in specific situations - some will be feedback, some will be hints, some will be requests to visit other students and some will just be to redirect attention to get back on task.  The automated teaching assistant will also prioritize tasks for the teacher; e.g., which students to visit in the classroom.  As part of this process, new sensors will be added to FACT that will monitor the teacher's speech and location. The potential broader impact includes facilitating teachers in conducting more pedagogically complex and effective lessons and increasing teacher job satisfaction while improving student learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also developing ways to use the MQE for both assessment and for instruction.<br/><br/>The materials, curriculum, and model produced by this project are helping elementary teachers learn important mathematics and learn to teach that mathematics in an equitable way.  Although the model includes mini courses that are taught throughout the program, the materials can easily be adapted to a longer, traditional course for preservice teachers.  The revisions of the MQE are producing an observational protocol that has the potential to vastly improve the way researchers study teachers' instructional practices."

In addition to watching recorded videos of classroom interactions or reading written cases, teacher educators and teachers can now watch animations and image sequences, realized with cartoon characters, and made to depict activities that happened, or could have happened, in a mathematics classroom. Furthermore, teacher educators and teachers can react to such animations or image sequences by making their own depictions of alternative moves by students or teachers in classroom interaction. And all of that can take place in an on-line, cloud-based environment that also supports discussion fora, questionnaires, and the kinds of capabilities associated with learning management systems. Such technologies offer important affordances to teacher educators seeking to provide candidates with course-based experiences that emphasize the development of practice-based skills. The focus of the project is on mathematics teacher education. This joint project of the University of Maryland Center for Mathematics Education and the University of Michigan will produce 6 to 8 field-tested modules for use in different courses that are a part of mathematics teacher preparation programs. The following two-pronged research question will be resolved: What are the affordances and constraints of the modules and the environment as supports for: (1) practice based teacher education and (2) a shift toward blended teacher education?<br/><br/>The project involves the following activities: (1) a teacher education materials development component; (2) a related evaluation component; and (3) two research components. The development phase seeks to develop both the LessonSketch.org platform and six to eight mathematics teacher education modules for use in preservice teacher education programs from around the country. The modules will be written with practice-based teacher education goals in mind and will use the capacities of the LessonSketch.org platform as a vehicle for using rich-media artifacts of teaching with preservice teacher candidates. LessonSketch Teacher Education Research and Development Fellows will be chosen through a competitive application process. They will develop their respective modules along with teams of colleagues that will be recruited to form their inquiry group and pilot the module activities. The evaluation activity will focus on the materials development aspect of the project. Data will be collected by the LessonSketch platform, which includes interviews with Fellows and their teams, perspectives of module writers, descriptive statistics of module use, and feedback from both teacher educator and preservice teacher end-users about the quality of their experiences. The first research activity of the project is design research on the kinds of technological infrastructure that are useful for practice-based teacher education. The PIs will identify tools that teacher educators need and want beyond the current capabilities for web-based support for use of rich media and will produce prototype tools inside the LessonSketch environment to meet these needs. The second research activity of the project will supplement the evaluation activity by examining the implementation of two of the modules in detail. This aspect of the research will examine the goals of the intended curriculum, the proposed modes of media use, the fidelity of the implemented curriculum, and learnings produced by preservice teachers. This research activity will help the field understand the degree to which practice-based teacher education that is mediated by an online access to rich media would be a kind of practice that could be easily incorporated into existing teacher education structures. <br/><br/>The project will produce 6 to 8 LessonSketch modules for use in teacher education classes. Each module will be implemented in at least eight teacher education classes across the country, which means that between 720 and 960 preservice teacher candidates will study the materials. The project aims to shift the field toward practice-based teacher education by supporting university programs to implement classroom-driven activities that will produce mathematics teachers with strong capabilities to teach mathematics effectively and meaningfully."

Exposure at a young age to CT is critical for preparing all students to engage with the technologies that have become central to nearly every occupation. But despite this recognized need, there are few, if any, resources that (1) introduce CT to young children; (2) define the scope of what should be taught; and (3) provide evidence-based research on effective strategies for bringing CT to a preschool audience. To meet these needs, WGBH and Education Development Center/Center for Children and Technology (EDC/CCT) will utilize an iterative research and design process to create animated and live-action videos paired with joint media engagement activities for parents and preschool children, titled ""Monkeying Around"".  Animated videos will model for children how to direct their curiosity into a focused exploration of the problem-solving process. Live-action videos will feature real kids and their parents and will further illustrate how helpful CT can be for problem solving. With their distinctive visual humor and captivating storytelling, the videos will be designed to entice parents to watch alongside their children. This is important since parents will play an important role in guiding them in explorations that support their CT learning. To further promote joint media engagement, hands-on activities will accompany the videos. Following the creation of these resources, an experimental impact study will be conducted to capture evidence as to if and how these resources encourage the development of young children's computational thinking, and to assess parents' comfort and interest in the subject. Concurrent with this design-based research process, the project will build on the infrastructure of state systems of early education and care (which have been awarded Race to the Top grants) and local public television stations to design and develop an outreach initiative to reach parents.  Additional partners--National Center for Women & Information Technology, Code in Schools, and code.org (all of whom are all dedicated to promoting CT)--will further help bring this work to a national audience. <br/><br/>Can parent/child engagement with digital media and hands-on activities improve children's early learning of computational thinking? To answer this question, WGBH and EDC/CCT are collaborating on a design-based research process with children and their parents to create  Monkeying Around successive interactions. The overarching goal of this mixed-methods research effort is to generate evidence that supports the development of recommendations around the curricular, instructional, and contextual factors that support or impede children's acquisition of CT as a result of digital media viewing and hands-on engagement. Moving through cycles of implementation, observation, analysis, and revision over the course of three years, EDC/CCT researchers will work closely with families and WGBH's development team to determine how children learn the fundamentals of CT, how certain learning tasks can demonstrate what children understand, how to stimulate interest in hands-on activities, and the necessary scaffolds to support parental involvement in the development of children's CT. Each phase of the research will provide rich feedback to inform the next cycle of content development and will include: Phase 1: the formulation of three learning blueprints (for algorithmic thinking, sequencing, and patterns); Phase 2: the development of a cohesive set of learning tasks to provide evidence of student learning, as well as the production of a prototype of the digital media and parent/child engagement resources (algorithmic thinking); Phase 3-Part A: pilot research on the prototype, revisions, production of two additional prototypes (sequencing and patterns); Phase 3-Part B: pilot research on the three prototypes and revisions; and Phase 4: production of 27 animated and live-action videos and 18 parent/child engagement activities and a study of their impact. Through this process, the project team will build broader knowledge about how to design developmentally appropriate resources promoting CT for preschool children and will generate data on how to stimulate interest in hands-on activities and the necessary scaffolds to support parental involvement in the development of children's CT. The entire project represents an enormous opportunity for WGBH and for the informal STEM media field to learn more about how media can facilitate informal CT learning in the preschool years and ways to broaden participation by building parents' capacity to support STEM learning.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

Much of this research has focused on describing the elements of discourse that investigators have posited as contributing to teaching and learning. This research study systematically expands on the characteristics of mathematical discourse and examines and specifies relationships between these descriptive elements across multiple content foci in mathematics and across a range of teachers at the middle grade levels. The principal investigator is conducting a microgenetic study based on examination of video data from multiple routine classroom settings with teachers who demonstrate varying levels of discourse across three curricular topics in mathematics. A review of the research literature on classroom discourse, with a focus in mathematics, supports the development of an analytic framework to characterize the discourse of both teachers and students in the classrooms. The discourse patterns from teachers at grades 5, 6 and 7 provide a comparison of the discourse across upper elementary and middle grade classrooms. <br/><br/>The use of the analytic framework supports the development of metrics that can reliably measure critical aspects of mathematical discourse. These metrics examine both the function of the discourse in the classroom and the mathematical intellectual work that the discourse supports. The researcher builds on the analytic framework and resulting metrics to redesign courses offered to pre-service and practicing teachers in the university teacher education program. The resulting framework and redesigned teacher education courses will provide models on which other teacher education programs might build. The redesign of the pre-service and in-service courses effectively integrates the research into education."

The roots of these individual differences can be traced back to school entry. Spatial skills - mentally representing and manipulating spatial information - strongly predict STEM achievement, course-taking, and careers. By 1st grade, children vary widely in spatial skills, pointing to the home environment's crucial role. The proposed research, led by a team of researchers at Temple University, will investigate the impact of parent-child interactions on spatial skills among 1st and 2nd graders. Importantly, not only skill but motivation- perceived competence, enjoyment of challenges, and low anxiety - impacts children's STEM trajectories. Unfortunately research on parents' support for children's STEM skills and motivation has proceeded in parallel, despite evidence that they reinforce one another. Prior research is also limited by short-term outcomes, parent self-report measures, or non-causal designs. The proposed studies will use longitudinal and experimental methods to 1carry out the following.  1) Identify specific aspects of parent-child interactions that predict children's spatial skills and STEM learning and motivation. 2) Establish causal relations between parents' cognitive support and children's spatial skills and motivation. 3) Establish causal relations between parents' motivational support and children's spatial skills and motivation. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>This project will empirically test an integrated model of parents' cognitive and motivational support for children's spatial skills and STEM achievement. Study 1 will use video data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to test whether directly-observed parenting behaviors (cognitive and motivational support) during spatial activities in 1st grade predict children's STEM achievement and motivation through age 18. Studies 2a and 2b will test causal effects of parents' cognitive support on children's spatial and math skills and motivation via experimental parent-led spatial book-reading and spatial activity interventions. Study 3 will test the impact of increasing parents' motivational support on children's spatial and math skills and motivation. Investigating these factors in a single conceptual framework is crucial to understand whether they have additive, or possibly multiplicative, effects on children's development. For example, a parent who provides high motivational support may be more attuned to their child's level of skill, and therefore provide higher-quality cognitive support. Further, receiving both cognitive and motivational support may be especially impactful. Together, these studies will not only directly test the integrated theory of parents' cognitive and motivational support, but will have the added benefit of setting the foundation for larger parent-directed interventions aimed at improving all children's spatial skills and STEM achievement and motivation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The complex domain of biology has causal pathways that are not always readily apparent to young children, and their explanations often contain many misconceptions and gaps in understanding. This project will add to a limited body of research on how children's recognition of information gaps influence subsequent interest in learning in formal and informal learning settings. The project will examine to what extent, if any, receiving or producing explanations motivates children's future learning, with three specific goals: (1) to examine whether children who first recognize that an explanation has significant gaps are interested in engaging in further learning of a particular topic; (2) to explore how the source of the explanation (by self or others) relates to the link between recognizing information gaps and future learning; and (3) to develop instructional strategies that can be used to induce students' recognition of explanatory gaps, measuring outcomes for these strategies, including children's subsequent ability to critically evaluate explanations and their interest in future learning. The conceptual framework will be guided by the social-cognitive theory, sociocultural theory, and mechanistic reasoning. This combined theoretical framing will promote a better assessment of which processes drive children's explanation evaluation - a crucial part of learning from others - and how mechanistic explanations can be useful lenses for analyzing the interactions of domain-specific (prior knowledge) and domain-general knowledge about learning.<br/><br/>This project will use laboratory-based quantitative methods and classroom-based teaching experiments. The quantitative methods include ANCOVAs of multiple covariates about a model that will be developed and implemented to explain developmental, individual, and task differences in responses to information gaps in scientific explanations. Behavioral measures will include ratings of explanation quality and individual difference measures, such as self-reported interest, biological knowledge, and interest in acquiring new information. Based on results from laboratory studies, scaffolds will be developed for classroom contexts to support children's productive engagement in critically evaluating biological explanations.

The complex domain of biology has causal pathways that are not always readily apparent to young children, and their explanations often contain many misconceptions and gaps in understanding. This project will add to a limited body of research on how children's recognition of information gaps influence subsequent interest in learning in formal and informal learning settings. The project will examine to what extent, if any, receiving or producing explanations motivates children's future learning, with three specific goals: (1) to examine whether children who first recognize that an explanation has significant gaps are interested in engaging in further learning of a particular topic; (2) to explore how the source of the explanation (by self or others) relates to the link between recognizing information gaps and future learning; and (3) to develop instructional strategies that can be used to induce students' recognition of explanatory gaps, measuring outcomes for these strategies, including children's subsequent ability to critically evaluate explanations and their interest in future learning. The conceptual framework will be guided by the social-cognitive theory, sociocultural theory, and mechanistic reasoning. This combined theoretical framing will promote a better assessment of which processes drive children's explanation evaluation - a crucial part of learning from others - and how mechanistic explanations can be useful lenses for analyzing the interactions of domain-specific (prior knowledge) and domain-general knowledge about learning.<br/><br/>This project will use laboratory-based quantitative methods and classroom-based teaching experiments. The quantitative methods include ANCOVAs of multiple covariates about a model that will be developed and implemented to explain developmental, individual, and task differences in responses to information gaps in scientific explanations. Behavioral measures will include ratings of explanation quality and individual difference measures, such as self-reported interest, biological knowledge, and interest in acquiring new information. Based on results from laboratory studies, scaffolds will be developed for classroom contexts to support children's productive engagement in critically evaluating biological explanations.

Measuring the quality and contributions of these programs to youth learning is important to both the afterschool organizations and the communities that support them, including participating youth and their families. To address the range and evolving interests and capacities of all young people within a community, there are, by necessity, a wide range of types of afterschool science programming. Such programming may vary by focus (e.g., botany, astronomy, computer science, engineering, or zoology), structure (e.g., hands-on, place-based, on-line, or in partnership with local industry) and other factors. Across the range of programming, there are different intended learning goals and opportunities for students.  For these reasons, a range of measurement tools are needed to monitor the quality and outcomes of wide range of afterschool science programs. To explore the current state of evaluation and measurement tools for use in afterschool science programs, the University of Washington, in partnership with the Afterschool Alliance and the National Girls Collaborative, will design and host a conference for afterschool STEM leaders, researchers, and evaluators. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/> <br/>This conference is grounded in the programmatic priorities and strategies of afterschool organizations. The goals of the conference are to (a) articulate and map the range of intended outcomes of afterschool STEM programs; (b) identify how existing measurement and evaluation tools map on to intended outcomes; and (c) identify overlaps, complementarities, and gaps in the available tools in order to provide guidance to (i) practitioners on how and why to select current evaluation tools and (ii) researchers on directions for future tool development. Tangible convening products include: <br/>     *A detailed, visual representation (""intended outcomes map"") of the range of outcomes afterschool programs are seeking to achieve, related to student learning, educator capacity, program quality, family impacts, learning ecosystems connectivity; <br/>     *A taxonomy of current evaluation instruments aligned to these outcomes, with an explanation of how they overlap or differentiate both methodologically and theoretically; <br/>     *The identification of the areas where further work is needed, including further specification of learning outcomes and future development of evaluation tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of these programs has risen substantially and there is increased interest in the value of such programs. Three instruments that will allow implementers to assess the effectiveness of their programs are being developed. These instruments are: (1) participant survey, (2) observational protocol, and (3) program analysis protocol.   Applying the logic underlying the theoretical approach and instrument development in career/occupational counseling, the project is addressing four issues.  The project draws on a theoretical framework to inform the development and integration of instruments that assess OST science programs.  In addition, the project modifies single subject research designs to observe and document more than one subject during an observational cycle of student engagement in OST programming.  By working with users of evaluation in the scientific and engineering research community, the project addresses the need for practitioner-oriented instruments that can be implemented by practitioners and have high reliability, validity, and quality control across observations and sites.

Computational thinking has traditionally been defined in the context of the discipline of computer science; however, as the other STEM fields have become more computational, computational thinking has emerged as a fundamental skill essential for students across a wide range of other STEM disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, geoscience, molecular biology, genetics, genomics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, applied mathematics, statistics, and modeling, simulation, and visualization, as well as some non-STEM fields (criminal justice, music, film, and animation). Given the scarcity of research defining computational thinking in the other STEM disciplines, and the equal scarcity of research on how to integrate computational thinking in the early grades through high school, there is an urgent need to bring together education researchers, K-12 practitioners, and disciplinary scientists to collaborate on the development of an evidence-based framework for defining computational thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective. A four and half day workshop will be held at the Education Development Center in Waltham, Massachusetts for participants who are studying the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM education, to collaborate on (1) defining the specific characteristics of computational thinking as it occurs within disciplinary learning across the elementary through high school grade bands, (2) determine the appropriate grade-specific assessments of computational thinking to measure student learning, and (3) make recommendations for integrating computational thinking in pre-service teacher education. The workshop will be evaluated by an external evaluator who will observe workshop activities, conduct interviews with workshop participants and project staff, and provide a final, summative analysis of the workshop's findings to assess whether project goals and objectives have been fully implemented. The workshop will contribute unique findings on the range of pedagogies and competencies needed to effectively teach and learn interdisciplinary computational thinking in K-12, and will advance future research on learning at the intersection of computing and the other STEM disciplines, a core objective of the STEM+Computing (STEM+C) program.<br/><br/>This STEM+C workshop studying interdisciplinary computational thinking is an 18-month effort that will be guided by a planning committee comprised of the Principal Investigators and project staff from the Education Development Center. Workshop participants will include education researchers, K-12 practitioners, disciplinary scientists, and Principal Investigators from NSF's STEM+C, ITEST, and other programs, and national thought leaders in education and computing. Participants will meet in specific grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12), in groups organized by subject matter, and in mixed groups, to analyze the assumptions and constructs that currently undergird computational thinking in the field and in their research, and seek to identify respective skills and competencies students will need in computational thinking for STEM fields, and appropriate teacher pedagogy supporting such skills development. The project team and participants will synthesize workshop discussions and findings, and collaborate on the development of an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that will (a) describe computational thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective to progress in grade bands across the STEM curriculum, (b) convey what it means for students to think computationally within and across the STEM fields, (c) articulate grade-band recommendations for assessing students' interdisciplinary computational thinking, and (d) make recommendations for integrating computational thinking in pre-service teacher education and teacher professional development, (e) identify areas for future research on interdisciplinary computational thinking, (f) produce a landscape study of existing computational thinking assessments with a gap analysis to determine alignment of existing assessments with the workshop's framework; and (f) create working groups for disseminating workshop findings via conference papers, peer reviewed journal articles, and presentations to national STEM-education and computing stakeholders, including policymakers in states implementing computer science standards in K-12. A summative evaluation will be conducted on the workshop and its results, including field-wide assessment and peer review of the framework. The workshop will advance core objectives of the STEM+C program to evolve evidence-based approaches to the integration of computing and computational thinking in K-12 teaching and learning; innovation of approaches to assessing grade-specific computational thinking; and new teacher pedagogy integrating computational thinking."

This project will investigate the integration of CT with mathematics and science with the goal of informing the development of new resources that provide preschool children with rich learning experiences that promote critical thinking and problem solving skills crucial for later school success. Project activities will include: 1) the development of research-based learning blueprints that delineate learning goals that integrate CT with mathematics and science; 2) the design and iterative testing of complementary hands-on and digital activities that address these learning goals, capture young children's interest, and also yield learning; and 3) the identification of design principles that guide the design of activity formats that can be used by educators and caregivers at school and at home. <br/><br/>The multidisciplinary project team will develop learning blueprints to serve as anchor documents, guiding the design of activities and research instrumentation. Furthermore, the team will engage in Design-Based Research and use a co-design approach in which multiple stakeholder, including preschool teachers, parents, children, and advisors, are directly and actively involved in the development and iterative pilot testing of digital and hands-on activities. This will ensure that design decisions link home and school learning, take into account the interests of young children, and address the needs and strengths of preschool programs and culturally diverse families. Researchers will conduct observations and interviews and make assessments of children's learning using evidence centered design learning tasks developed as part of this study and conduct mixed method analyses. The results of this investigation could inform future research and practice seeking to integrate CT with early childhood science and mathematics. Likewise, the co-design process used here could inform other efforts that seek to include diverse stakeholders in design based research."

Representatives of a public school district, a state university, a college of engineering, and a center for environmental research and technology will collaborate in designing, implementing, and examining the impacts of the curriculum on student understanding of air quality, health risks associated with reduced air quality, and pathways to careers in air quality monitoring and management. The project is located in an area where air quality is a significant environmental concern, and where there are opportunities for students to gain direct experiences with emerging technologies associated with air quality monitoring and mitigating environmental impacts.  Over a two-year period, the project will implement 18 new air-quality lessons developed by teachers within existing high school science courses.  The project will also engage participating teachers in related professional learning opportunities focusing on research and culturally responsive teaching during summers and through weekly meetings during the academic year.  The project will be guided by an Advisory Board that includes representatives of local academic institutions, industry partners, and government agencies.<br/><br/>The aims of this project are to: (a) Enhance a high school science curriculum by incorporating newly developed lessons focusing on air-quality monitoring, (b) Evaluate the effectiveness of the new curriculum and associated teacher professional learning opportunities in promoting student understanding of the impacts of air quality on their everyday lives, (c) Identify intra-personal, inter-personal, and cultural influences on the effectiveness of the new air quality curriculum intervention, and (d) Raise awareness among students of possible career opportunities with environmental industries locally and globally.  The 18 new lessons being developed by the project will be tested through a randomized control research design involving a minimum of 30 science teachers across five comprehensive high schools of a large metropolitan school district.

The research will examine how emergent bilinguals and others participate in language and literacy use in and outside of school and use that knowledge to inform the development of computer science curricula. One component of the project extends existing curriculum development and learning research as emergent bilinguals learn computational thinking in courses designed to leverage their language use. The second component engages New York City educators, community groups, and adults in understanding how computing can be integrated into larger multilingual education initiatives in and outside of schools.<br/><br/>The research builds on a theory of social language use, known as translanguaging, to frame the design of curriculum and professional development materials. The central research question asks how translanguaging pedagogy can be used to integrate the literacy practices of multiple human languages, computer code, and school disciplines (e.g., science, language arts) in meaningful ways. Iterations of the curriculum and professional development design will study the ways that students use language to talk about computing in and outside of schools and how teachers learn with the professional development materials. Case studies of students and teachers working in and out of schools will be collected to illustrate the instructional units, how they involve computational thinking, and how language use unfolds as students work. The research will result in new models for 1) how translanguaging approaches can support emergent bilinguals and other students to learn computational literacies, 2) how computational literacy use outside of school can be connected to school-based practices, and 3) how professional development can be designed for teachers to infuse computational literacies into middle school curricula that support students with diverse language backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the past 30 years, there has been a decrease of women earning computer science degrees and entering the CS workforce. To reverse this trend, there has been a surge of girls only programs for recruiting and mentoring girls in CS. Despite their popularity, however, there exists only minimal research on the efficacy of these programs to grow the population of women in CS and little is known about the most effective ways to implement these programs. The project will research the main effects and interactions between female-only and balanced gender CS camps and role models for middle school students.  More specifically, the project will examine how gender influences girls' self-efficacy, interest, perceived social support, and skill development in CS. The findings can increase the effectiveness of such efforts and contribute to the diversification of this key workforce sector. The project will directly impact over 400 middle school participants from low income and rural backgrounds by introducing them to concepts of computing and providing experiences to develop skill and confidence that can set them on a path toward a CS career. The project will directly impact 54 high school age mentors as they learn and teach computing skills.  Project research findings and learning resources will be widely disseminated to educational researchers and practitioners through research publications, educational conferences, publications oriented towards educators, social media, and a project website including research and curriculum materials.  This project is funded by the  Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of best practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to engaging students in learning and developing interest in STEM, information and communications technology (ICT), computer science, and related STEM content and careers. <br/><br/>The research goal is to contribute to the evidence about strategies and models that enhance girls interest in and capabilities to pursue CS programs and occupations. Building on a foundation of social cognitive theory, this study can identify empirically grounded principles to inform practice in this critical area. To research the influence of gender in these programs, the project will use a 2X2 quasi-experimental design guided by two research questions: (1) What are the main and interaction effects of gender-specific social competency modeling and single gender vs. balanced gender groupings on girls' interest, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and skill in CS in a summer camp context? and (2)How (if at all) do gender-specific social competency modeling and single gender vs. balanced gender groupings affect girls' interest, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and skill in CS camps? The research will directly inform best practice for recruiting girls into computing using evidence from a controlled study.  Girls only programs are designed to create more empowering opportunities free from possible negative social pressures based on stereotypes of computing as a male activity. To date, no study has examined program outcomes in such a way that the differential influences of single vs. balanced gender environments and role models can be independently and jointly assessed."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will develop, implement, test, and revise instructional approaches and materials for high school students that focus on the links between scientific evidence and alternative explanations of phenomena relating to Earth and space education.  Students will examine alternative explanations for natural phenomena associated with extreme weather events, freshwater resource availability, and related topics in learning how to evaluate scientifically valid lines of evidence and explanation.  Students will learn to construct diagrams showing the links between explanatory models of natural phenomena and lines of evidence, and then evaluate the plausibility of various alternative explanations for events.  It is expected that engagement in these activities will help students gain proficiency in model-based reasoning, critical thinking, planning and analyzing scientifically valid investigations, constructing plausible explanations, engaging in collaborative argumentation, and critically evaluating scientific information.     <br/><br/>This 4-year Design and Development project will examine use of Model-Evidence Link (MEL) diagrams that are intended to help students cognitively construct mental scaffolds that assist their engagement in the practices of critical evaluation, plausibility appraisal, and knowledge construction related to science topics that are considered by some as controversial.  Prior research has demonstrated the potential educational outcomes of using MEL diagrams, but this project will extend the previous work by examining an approach where students construct their own MEL diagrams (build-a-MELs, or baMELs). The project will examine the use of both pre-constructed MELs and baMELs for effectiveness in promoting student engagement in scientific reasoning and practices. The project will employ design-based research methodologies in pursuing answers to three research questions: (1) Do baMEL activities tested in multiple high school classroom settings promote critical evaluation, plausibility reappraisal, and scientifically accurate knowledge construction about controversial Earth and space science topics? (2) How do these additional baMELs differ from pre-constructed MELs in promoting critical evaluation, plausibility reappraisal, and knowledge construction? And (3) To what extent does repeated use of both pre-constructed MELs and baMELs result in student engagement of scientific practices (i.e., asking critical questions, using model-based reasoning, planning and analyzing scientifically valid investigations, constructing plausible explanations, engaging in collaborative argumentation, and critically evaluating scientific information)?  The project will engage high school students taking Earth and space classes in selected schools of Georgia, New Jersey, and within Philadelphia.

Research shows that engaging these students in STEM activities relevant to their everyday lives is critical to increasing their motivation, interest, learning, and participation in STEM. This project will address this need through engineering and computer science activities aimed at helping 400 middle and high school students grasp the intricacies of scientific principles and technology design. The goal is to inspire and prepare a greater number of students from the targeted population to understand how these principles and design strategies contribute to a stronger educational and technological society. To do this, the project will use a teaching and learning model that will integrate human-centered robotics and telepresence theme-based activities in a problem-based learning and systems thinking environment. In this project, human-centered robotics will involve the development of robotics technologies and applications for everyday use while telepresence robots will enable better communication, operation, and exploration across enormous distances. This dual strategy makes the proposed technological approach highly relevant to the daily needs of students in Alaska.<br/><br/>The project will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty mentors from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and from the School of Informatics and Computing and the Center for Research on Learning and Technology at Indiana University at Bloomington. Through this partner-effort, the research team will develop a curriculum that addresses the technical and societal aspects of the human-centered robotics and telepresence that underlie the engineering and computer science concepts students will learn about. Each year, students will actively engage in a 9-month problem-based learning strategy using two basic open-architecture platforms based on the Arduino microcontroller. Students will be able to customize these platforms through design variations and with the addition of new sensors, actuators, program parts, and other technology-related functions. User-friendly software will help teachers and mentors assist students with their designs and redesigns. Through this approach, students will gain STEM knowledge and skills that will be useful to their own individual lives and for sharing with other students, who might be chronically ill, reside in remote places, live in the lower 48 states, or even internationally via ties established through prior NSF-supported efforts. Hence, this project will help student develop technology-based products adaptable to peoples' daily environments, needs, and practices in some meaningful way, which in turn, could increase student's motivation and interest in STEM and STEM careers."

It is hypothesized that the newly developed program will have a positive impact on the science achievement of high school students, that it will improve teacher science content knowledge and classroom practice, and that the effects on student outcomes will be equitable across student demographic variables.  To test thee hypotheses, the project will employ a quasi-experimental research approach in which teachers will serve as their own comparison groups in a cohort control design.  Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to differentiate the effects of variances in teacher content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, student demographic variables, and school factors.

The significance of the QUEST CT project is that it will (1) develop a model for teacher professional development to support integration of Computational Thinking into STEM classroom activities, and (2) broaden the participation of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM and computing through the combination of formal and informal learning experiences. The project will directly impact more than 1000 students as 18 project teachers implement Computational Thinking-integrated science lessons into classroom activities over two years. The Computational Thinking lessons developed and field tested by teachers will contribute to the need for exemplary resources that effectively integrate Computational Thinking concepts into existing STEM classroom content and will be available to all educators.  <br/><br/>The goals of QUEST CT are: to increase teacher knowledge and ability to integrate Computational Thinking as defined by ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) and CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Association) into fifth and sixth grade science lessons and activities; and to increase student STEM interest and understanding of Computational Thinking concepts in the context of learning science. With support from various school districts, the project will engage 18 fifth and sixth grade teachers in professional development including a summer academy, coached lesson development, and professional learning communities. Each year, more than 500 students from three school districts that reflect varying levels of diversity will be involved in the project through formal classroom activities and informal events such as summer camp, after school clubs and family nights. Ongoing mentoring and support from the project leadership will allow close monitoring of project progress. Graduate and undergraduate computer science students will provide technical support for teachers as they implement Computational Thinking learning experiences. The project uses a combination of two educational research approaches: exploratory research and design and development research.  The fundamental education problem addressed is to design and implement an intervention that replaces the disjointed efforts to integrate Computational Thinking into STEM within K-12."

This proposed Exploratory Integration study is to determine under what conditions integrating computation and computational thinking in agricultural education and problem solving will increase student interest, motivation, performance in courses, independent projects, and technical careers. It is expected that students will gain proficiency in the application of programming to solve specific problems in agriculture and will derive interest in pursuing computational science and/or computing in their future academic courses and career selection. The objectives of the project include creating an educational program for students composed of four introductory and two advanced modules focused on agriculture challenges. Investigators will utilize online training workshops to prepare the participating cohort of teachers to effectively implement the education program, and to build a peer-support network to support teacher success. This project is an integration of computation within agricultural science to provide an opportunity to build a youth career model that will be applicable or adaptable to the multitudes of rural agriculture communities and schools in the Nation. <br/><br/>Many national reports indicate the need for advancing computer science and advancing the integration of computing into STEM content in response to computationally-intensive careers, but there is a scarcity of studies examining embedding computing into non-computing careers and technical courses, such as agriculture science or agricultural mechanics classes. Thus, this agricultural-based project will address an important gap in academic research and the impact of computational agriculture on the future workforce. Although primarily-rural industries like agriculture and natural resource management are becoming increasingly technical and computationally-driven, rural students see themselves as consumers of these technologies rather than potential creators of the technologies and applications. Rural students continue to be underserved in computing and STEM education. This project will address these deficiencies by deriving high-quality educational courses exposing students to computing in a way that will appeal to the culture of the rural audience. Investigators want to know: under what conditions does integrating computing skills and competencies to address and help solve agricultural problems, increase student interest, motivation, and career opportunities? Further, how do students of different demographic and academic backgrounds interact with the computing-modified agriculture curriculum? Do these students have similar engagement patterns, performance, interest, and attitude changes? How do teachers' implementation models lead to greater classroom impact? Finally, what aspects of the implementation and integration influence student engagement and interest in future computing and STEM courses and careers?"

The project will expand an existing research practice partnership (RPP) focused on increasing computational making (i.e. the integration of design, coding, and making to create interactive artifacts) learning opportunities for middle grade youth living in the Chicago Bronzeville community. By adding a school-day component, the project will focus on curating, developing, and implementing instructional materials that integrate computational making learning activities into middle grade (6-8) classrooms. Grounded in the prior work of the Digital Youth Network (DYN), the project approach will create an ecosystem to support student development of digital media literacies. By creating a learning ecosystem that creates a context where CS/CT literacies are accessible, relevant, and valued, the project will create the motivation for students to seek opportunities to deepen and showcase their developing CS/CT skills within a supportive community of peers, mentors, teachers, and families. The project will address national and local conversations by providing a living example of how to bring together a cohort of schools, informal learning providers, and academics to create and implement an intro to computational making middle school strategy. This strategy will blend together learning activities designed to develop core computational making skills, with content-focused projects (e.g. math, science, social studies, literacy and art), and community showcases designed to support and grow student and family understanding and engagement in the diversity of ways to use computer science and computational thinking to create, develop, and control interactive artifacts that have meaning in everyday life.<br/><br/>The Bronzeville Fusion Network RPP team will work to address two shared questions: (1) How can we foster a community learning environment, anchored within schools, that recognizes, supports, and promotes computational literacies as a desirable and accessible form of social capital by educators, youth, and families? (2) How do these community level connections impact youth CS/CT learning opportunities, participation, social networks, knowledge, and understanding? To address these questions the RPP team will leverage existing quality CS/CT resources (e.g. tools, programs, curriculum, especially those that are free and research-based), existing local infrastructure and policies (e.g. online learning platforms, professional development models), and programmable interactive electronics (e.g. sensors, arduinos, makey makey) to create culturally meaningful computational making learning opportunities that connect middle school learners to quality opportunities in ways that work and that are sustainable. To accomplish this goal, the project will systematically engage in hyperlocal work in Bronzeville, a Chicago community on the southside of Chicago, representing approximately 119,000 residents. The project will work with schools, educators and leaders from local community organizations to collaboratively explore, curate, and organize existing national CS/CT learning resources into culturally meaningful blended learning activities and modules intentionally designed to engage Bronzeville youth in exploring and discovering the essential role of CS/CT literacies in making the interactive objects students use daily. We will also use a networked strategy in Bronzeville, capitalizing on a citywide online learning platform that brings together face-to-face and online learning resources to support students, families, and teachers in finding and participating in formal and informal activities designed to increase student engagement in academics and enrichment activities, allowing youth to develop portfolios of work and participation and to see and comment on the interactive artifacts created by peers. While this work will focus within the Bronzeville community, all of the curricular and learning resources developed through this RPP will be deployed at a broader city level through this online platform."

Often informal science learning projects focus on developing positive affective outcomes.  Research has shown, however, that negative affective experiences such as struggle and challenge can be particularly powerful for learning. Learners who experience struggle and effort are likely to adopt a growth mindset, in which they attribute their mastery of skills and understanding to effort rather than innate ability.  This been shown to be an important factor in lifelong learning, academic achievement, and persistence. The research will develop and refine a model of productive struggle and its impact in designed informal science learning experiences, and will elaborate a flexible set of evidence-based design guidelines and strategies for eliciting and supporting visitor engagement in productive struggle. This project is supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which funds research and innovative resources for use in a variety of settings as a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>Research suggests that productive struggle, which manifests itself as confusion or even frustration, can occur when learners actively engage in challenges that push them just beyond the limits of their existing capabilities. For learners to engage in productive struggle, they must perceive that their efforts will be worthwhile. The research will (1) explore the individual and contextual factors associated with the emotional experience of productive struggle during informal learning experiences, (2) elaborate how learning experience design strategies can be implemented to support diverse learners to successfully engage in productive struggle, and (3) examine the relationships between productive struggle experiences, learner characteristics, and desired learning outcomes. Through an iterative research process involving qualitative comparative analysis, design-based research, and descriptive quantitative analysis, the proposed project will develop an empirically-tested theoretical model and a refined and tested set of guidelines and strategies for designing informal learning experiences which encourage productive struggle."

Students misinterpret phylogenetic trees, they misunderstand fundamental concepts of common ancestry, and they have a poor grasp of evolutionary time.  This project will address widespread misunderstandings related to evolution by developing and testing a new high school curriculum unit and assessment measures focusing on biological evolution.  The University of Utah Genetic Science Learning Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science are collaborating to develop a curriculum unit that models integration of the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards: disciplinary core ideas, science practices, and crosscutting concepts.  The new curriculum will also integrate Common Core Mathematics standards on reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, and an English Language Arts standard for writing arguments focused on discipline-specific content.  This project builds on a previously funded NSF project that developed and tested six prototype lessons on natural selection.  In classroom enactments the lessons showed preliminary promise for significantly increasing student understanding of natural selection and decreasing their misconceptions about natural selection and statistics.<br/><br/>This research and development project is based on the hypothesis that students will better understand the disciplinary core ideas about biological evolution when curriculum materials and instruction have certain identified features and when professional development experiences prepare teachers to use those materials and instructional practices.  The research questions and research plan are designed to test this hypothesis using a randomized controlled trial design that allows for iterative rounds of refinement.  The study will engage 20 teachers of grades 9-10 biology from across the U.S. who teach a diversity of students.  To conduct the research, the project will develop measures of student understanding and a measure of teacher content knowledge.  A measure of evidence-based evolution argumentation will also be developed for use with teachers and students."

In order to do this, children must be able to do two things. First, they must be able to reason about how the world works so that they can understand the causal systems they encounter, such as what causes earthquakes. Second, children must be able to think about their own knowledge and the process of learning so that they will know whether and how to change their beliefs about causal systems. This project seeks to (1) discover how the capacity for belief revision develops in the early elementary-school years, (2) explore how this capacity relates to children's awareness of their own learning, and (3) describe how both of these processes relate to children's interactions with museum exhibits. The research team involves developmental laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania and Brown University and informal STEM learning partners at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the Providence Children's Museum. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds fundamental research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/><br/>The project involves two lines of research, which study children's responses to different kinds of science puzzles. The first series of experiments are lab-based and vary the information that children observe and the types of exploratory actions that they can take. Children are also interviewed to find out how they think about science and learning. This design is intended to determine how different sets of evidence and different exploratory actions affect children's learning. It also addresses how children's abilities for belief revision may differ between abstract and contextualized causal systems. This line of work additionally investigates when children gain the capacity to revise their beliefs explicitly in the face of counterevidence, linking their scientific thinking capacities to their developing metacognitive abilities. The second series of experiments observes and records children's explorations of and interactions in museum exhibits. Parents and children are interviewed and asked to comment on video clips of their museum explorations. This allows the researchers to examine how naturally occurring behavior in informal learning settings affects children's learning and views about learning. Findings can illuminate how children learn to integrate evidence with their beliefs, which can inform educational policies and practices around the teaching of science. These studies can also advance researchers and museum practitioners' understanding of how museum environments foster children's growth into healthy, independent thinkers and how to support caregivers' efforts to assist children's learning."

Students studied in this longitudinal study will initially be sophomores in two geographically different urban settings - Buffalo, NY and Denver, CO.  The students in the sample have math grades that place in them in the top 20% of their class but have limited social, economic, and cultural capital (for example, parents whose education ended with little or no-college attendance). Because prior work has found that matriculation in good colleges and selection of STEM majors has varied widely in comparing students who seem to come from comparable high schools in terms of socioeconomic status, this study will add to our understanding of underlying factors.  Also, the extensive investment across US Public high schools in AP, IB, magnet schools, after-school programs, science competitions, and other enrichment activities indicates that improved understanding of the impact of these investments would be likely to be valuable to many school districts.<br/><br/>Prior research has shown that expanded opportunity structures in science and math facilitate greater college attendance, including at elite colleges.  But there is not sufficient research on which types of students are helped by this and on how such structures influence student choice of academic major.  <br/><br/>This study builds upon extensive prior research including those that employed anthropological and sociological investigations of indicators that influence personal perceptions and subsequent decisions regarding students' roles in society. This study is grounded by theoretical support from Bourdieu's Theory of Social Practice (1977) and Arum, Gamoran, and Shavit's Theory of Educational Expansion and Differentiation (2007). Answers to the research questions guiding this study are expected to advance understanding of the impact of school structures to expand educational opportunities in science and math to non-socially and non-culturally capitalized students. The PIs hypothesize that when such opportunities for educational expansion are implemented they should contribute to the reduction of inequalities associated with STEM pursuits and outcomes."

The STEM Engagement through Mentoring (SEM) project adds to the current research landscape in two ways. First, it relies on an intentionally designed partnership among the University of Houston's College of Education, College of Natural Science & Mathematics, and College of Engineering. Second, the program focuses on interactions among underrepresented fourth and fifth grade boys, their male STEM mentors and their fathers / male caregivers who participate in an afterschool and Saturday program that provides engaging, hands-on STEM experiences. Undergraduate student mentors are also drawn from groups who have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM. Grounded in pilot work, the project focuses on (a) improving interactions between pre-service teachers (who lead the program sessions) and undergraduate mentors (who support the students) and (b) creating hands-on STEM lessons that are aligned with Texas standards and the Next Generation Science Standards. The project has potential to inform theories of how mentoring relationships impact learners' motivation, knowledge and skills while at the same time, illuminating how the mentoring process and relationships affect mentors themselves.<br/><br/>The project pursues three research questions: 1) In what ways do the fathers/mentors motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for STEM careers? 2) To what extent does involvement in the SEM program shape boys' and mentors' STEM identity? And, 3) What impact does the SEM program have on pre-service teachers' self-efficacy for teaching engineering content? To answer these questions, the project will use a mixed methods approach including interviews, focus groups, observations, and surveys. Results of an external program evaluation will be used for program improvement and expansion, and to evaluate the early promise of the program for student outcomes in science and mathematics. The SEM team will initially work with four schools in the Houston region to directly impact 120 fourth and fifth grade students. Subsequently, the project aims to expand its impact to a national scale by formalizing and strengthening its partnership with the teachHOUSTON secondary STEM pre-service teacher training program at the University of Houston. SEM's overarching goal is to scale to 45 additional universities that are part of the national UTeach network. By leveraging the strategic partnership with a UTeach implementation site, SEM has the potential to reach thousands of underrepresented fourth and fifth grade students across the country."

The project activities integrate science, engineering, and computing to address socio-environmental problems that are multifaceted, have local and global significance, and lend themselves to personally meaningful and authentic disciplinary STEM engagement. The hypothesis is that this integrated approach will strengthen youth's STEM-linked identities, broaden their STEM academic and career pathways, provide a model for meaningful STEM integration, and nurture teachers' learning. The project will recruit 60 middle school students from two rural school districts in North Carolina (Randolph County School district and Rockingham County School district). These districts will partner with three middle schools that serve diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged student populations. The project includes a research component to study youths' STEM-linked identities, which will: (1) identify features of the program that trigger and sustain STEM identity work; (2) fill an enduring gap in the literature by identifying long-term, identity-related outcomes of informal STEM education; and (3) provide an updated, tested model of disciplinary identity. This project contributes to a long-term goal to improve the STEM learning infrastructure in the North Carolina Piedmont so youths who have historically been denied an enriching STEM education can access and remain on pathways that lead to STEM-related personal affiliation, academic success, and career opportunities.<br/><br/>The project objectives are: (1) create, enact, and refine a pedagogical model that engages middle school youth with socioenvironmental problems through science, engineering, and computing; (2) study the effectiveness of the model in triggering and sustaining youth's STEM-linked identities and pathways; (3) test an updated model of disciplinary identity; (4) study the effectiveness of the program for teachers' STEM professional learning. The project includes the following primary intervention strategies: (a) a two-week residential Summer Institute (SI) focuses on the problem of access to clean water, examined through science, engineering, and computing. Near-peer mentors, STEM professionals, undergraduates and graduates in STEM fields, and a STEM career counselor contribute to the SI. Participants include 60 youth and six teachers from partner schools; (b) Saturday Academies (SAs) focus on environmental problems integrating engineering design and computing.

The multi-pronged approach has positioned the CS for All movement to make rapid progress in the goal of broadening access to computing education for K-12 learners. However, this rapid expansion has also created significant difficulties, as the options available to schools and teachers have outpaced the supports necessary for a school district, without an expert in CS education, to thoughtfully select CS education partners to facilitate teacher professional development and curricular implementation. Selection of CS education partners requires an understanding of how to coordinate vision, implementation, and curriculum decisions. Thus, this project will create a research-practice partnership (RPP) to support K-8 schools in developing coordinated visions and multi-grade implementation plans that facilitate their development of sustainable CS programs that scale to broader participation. Through research and implementation, the project will contribute to an understanding of CS education implementation choices at the K-8 level. These implementation choices are key to sustainable CSforAll initiatives around the country. The project will contribute to the understanding of that decision making process, supports that can help schools and districts in the process, and measures for schools and districts to use to assess the alignment of their ongoing implementation to community visions. These outcomes will contribute fundamental insights about how to foster systemic educational change efforts as they relate to CS education. <br/><br/>The research, a descriptive study, will focus on documenting and understanding the process of visioning, aligned decision making, and implementation moves that can facilitate broader participation in K-8 computing education. Four project goals guide the Researcher Practitioner Partnership (RPP) work: Goal 1: Establish an RPP between the CSforAll Consortium, New York University, and two Boards of Cooperative Educational Services in rural and suburban New York to support CS for All efforts, with an eye toward long-term partnership and future, iterative work. Goal 2: Design and pilot visioning, decision-making, and implementation routines that can provide an integrated toolkit for facilitating K-8 school and district decision making around CS for All implementation. Goal 3: Develop a set of practical measures that can provide fast, formative metrics for districts and schools to evaluate the alignment and implementation of their CS for All initiatives over time. Goal 4: Conduct research on the guided decision-making and implementation processes that the partnership undertakes that will result in scholarly insights about enabling more nuanced and robust CS for All implementation decisions that can be scalable, sustainable, and reach broader populations of learners."

As the basic research in this field becomes more mature, exciting possibilities for application of this knowledge have begun to emerge. This proposal aims to capitalize on these findings by developing assistive learning technologies that may revolutionize the way we teach and train people.  Researchers at New York University will develop automated ""adaptive teaching"" technologies that guide learners through material in an individualized way. The goal is to increase retention or mastery of materials by tailoring instruction to individual learners.  The novel contribution of this project is to combine insights from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning in the design and operation of such technologies.  Successful development of this synergistic research would be a transformative application of neuroscience to our daily lives and may lead to new commercial technologies.  The research will also provide a post-doctoral training opportunity for the next generation of scientists working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science. The award is from the Integrated Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems program, with funding from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning, and from the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences division in the SBE directorate. <br/><br/>The specific scientific goal is to explore novel applications of neuroscience methods (particularly fMRI) to improve how people learn. Neuroscience research has identified robust neural correlates of successful memory formation (e.g., activity in brain areas such as the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus). The goal of this project is to use these variables to help predict the information needs of learners in an adaptive way. The project design involves scanning an individual's brain during the learning phase of a task. The research team then will identify which materials would benefit from additional study by combining computational models of the time course of learning and forgetting with theories mapping neural activation to successful memory formation. A computer algorithm then selects new materials for learners to re-study in a subsequent session. The goal is to show that generating a training sequence from a computer-based ""neurofeedback"" algorithm can enhance long-term memory retention more than when learners choose for themselves which items to re-study. This is a high-risk but potentially large reward project that merges basic science findings from neuroscience and cognitive science in ways that may transform the way we educate people."

How can we identify best practices for incorporating new media technologies into learning environments in a way that resonates with youth, including their interests, goals, and the ways they use technology in their everyday lives?  How do we resolve the need to document and recognize informal STEM learning and connect it to formal education contexts?  What strategies can be developed for inspiring and tracking student progress towards the learning goals outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)? These questions are the underlying motivation for this CAREER program of research. Digital badges represent a specific kind of networked technology and have been touted as an alternative credentialing system for recognizing and rewarding learning across domains, both inside and outside of formal education contexts. While there is considerable enthusiasm and speculation around the use of digital badges, the extent to which they succeed at empowering learners and connecting their learning across contexts remains largely untested. This project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge.<br/><br/>The approach taken for this program of study is a three phased design-based research effort that will be focused on four objectives: (1) identifying design principles and support structures needed to develop and implement a digital badge system that recognizes informal STEM learning; (2) documenting the opportunities and challenges associated with building a digital badge ecosystem that connects informal learning contexts to formal education and employment opportunities; (3) determining whether and how digital badges support learners' STEM identities; and (4) determining whether and how digital badges help learners to connect their informal STEM learning to formal education and employment opportunities.  In Phase 1, an existing prototype created in prior work at Seattle's Pacific Science Center will be developed into a fully functional digital badge system.  In Phase 2, the PI will also work collaboratively with higher education stakeholders to establish formal mechanisms for recognizing Pacific Science Center badges in higher education contexts. In Phase 3, the badge ecosystem will be expanded and students' use of and engagement with badges will be tracked as they apply to and enter college.<br/><br/>The project involves high school students participating in the Discovery Corps program at the Pacific Science Center, undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Washington, and stakeholders in the K-12 and higher education community in Seattle.  Educational activities integrated with this program of research will support: (1) mentoring University of Washington students throughout the project to develop their skills as practice-oriented researchers; (2) incorporating the research processes and findings from the project into university courses aimed at developing students' understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with using new media technologies to support learning; and (3) using the research findings to develop educational outreach initiatives to support other informal STEM learning institutions in their use of digital badges."

The project will foster and research the broad implementation of an integrated suite of science, technology, engineering, arts/design, and mathematics (STEAM) learning innovations into schools called FUSE Studios. FUSE is a new kind of interest-driven learning experience that engages pre-teens and teens in learning technical, STEM workforce relevant skills and trans-disciplinary skills-often called 21st century skills, such as self-regulation, persistence, leadership, and critical thinking skills. The core activities in FUSE are a set of challenges. Each challenge uses a leveling up model from gaming and is carefully designed to engage participants in different STEAM topics and skill sets. FUSE currently has several dozen challenges areas such as robotics, electronics, biotechnology, graphic design, Android app development, 3D printing and more. Current project research demonstrates that FUSE is sparking and developing student interest in STEAM and information and communications technology (ICT) fields, especially among students who have not previously considered these career directions. The insights generated by this project will aid school leaders and teachers in adopting and organizing experiences for their students that emphasize youth interests, choice, diverse modes of interaction with knowledgeable others, and a wide range of innovative and heterogeneous learning opportunities in STEAM and ICT. Over the course of this project, FUSE Studios will double its current active reach by expanding to 40 new schools, with 160 new FUSE studios, and reach 16,000-21,400 new students, particularly underrepresented, minority students in under-resourced schools.<br/><br/>The project will research two distinct but complementary strategies, for significantly broadening the implementation of FUSE. These two strategies are called the direct district engagement model and the industry partnership model. The research will focus on how these strategies are successful (or not) in leading to sustainable adoption and spread. Each strategy is designed to respond to distinct organizational conditions found in local schools and districts.  The proposed project will investigate three distinct but related aspects of spreading a successful intervention: (a) the process of spreading FUSE project through the two strategies noted above, (b) the life cycle of an intervention (getting in, getting rooted, and spread) and, (c) the ways in which the project is adopted and adapted in different settings (nature of modifications and their impact on integrity of the program). The project will use the concept of a ""tracer"" from biological research as an analytic device to systematically follow how different institutions adopt, adapt and sustain the innovation (i.e., the FUSE model).  In brief, the research will follow how FUSE gets rooted and spreads when it is introduced to the different schools and districts.  The research will be guided by the Actor theory Network (ACT), which provides a set of empirical heuristics and concepts for tracing how ideas, practices and artifacts move and become progressively stabilized within social contexts. Studying the broad implementation of FUSE Studios will produce generalizable understandings of how innovative educational, workforce-related, technology experiences can be brought into schools in impactful and sustainable ways on a large scale. This research will make valuable contributions to the important and understudied question of how learning innovations are effectively scaled up."

In this project, Twin Cities Public Television (TPT) will produce Latina SciGirls, a fourth season of the Emmy Award-winning television and transmedia project SciGirls. Latina SciGirls includes six half-hour television episodes of SciGirls filmed in Spanish, showing groups of Hispanic girls and their Latina STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) mentors investigating culturally relevant science and engineering problems of interest to Hispanic communities across the U.S.  Television mentors and girls will be filmed in Hispanic communities in the southwest and southeastern U.S. and represent various cultural backgrounds and ethnicities.  TPT will also create a series of family and girl-friendly online role model video profiles in Spanish and English of Latina STEM professionals.  In addition to the media components, the project will provide opportunities to connect girls and their families with in-person Latina role models and STEM programming via community outreach in diverse Hispanic communities across the country.  The goal of the project is to promote positive STEM identity development in middle school-age Hispanic girls. Hispanic women are the largest group of minority females, constituting 8% of the U.S. population, however, the participation of Hispanic women in science and engineering is significantly low: in 2010, just 2% of all of the scientists and engineers in the U.S. workforce were Hispanic women. The approach to Latina SciGirls is rooted both in research-based strategies proven to engage girls in STEM, and the need to address specific barriers that prevent many Hispanic girls from participating fully in STEM activities.  These barriers include lack of STEM identity (girls' perception of themselves as scientists or engineers), limited exposure to STEM role models, and low parental engagement and English proficiency.  Research shows that Hispanic girls have high interest and confidence in STEM, and a strong work ethic, but lack support and exposure to STEM professionals. <br/><br/>TPT will uniquely leverage the power of national media and outreach to enable Latina STEM professionals to interact with girls and their families both onscreen and in person.  Latina SciGirls episodes will be broadcast nationally by PBS and the nation's largest Hispanic network, Univisin, and streamed online at PBSKids.org.  Resources will be made available to additional Spanish-speaking communities nationwide through the NSF-funded outreach program, SciGirls CONNECT, and through partnership with the National Girls Collaborative Project.  TPT will commission an external research study with the University of Colorado-Boulder, which will test the hypothesis: The SciGirls model, when augmented to address specific barriers to STEM engagement of Hispanic girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, will promote the development of positive STEM-related identities in Hispanic girls.  In this capacity, the study will investigate Hispanic girls' personal experiences engaging with the project deliverables and how those experiences contribute to their STEM-related identity development against cultural and gender-based stereotypes.  An external evaluation by Knight-Williams, Inc. will include front-end, formative and summative phases. The front-end evaluation will involve stakeholders in the development of a Spanish language program that features culturally appropriate storylines and showcases Latina STEM professionals.  Formative evaluation will include focus groups of girls and families offering their reactions to the appeal and perceived value of the program.  Summative evaluation will capture the reach of the broadcast, online components and community events.  TPT will disseminate the research and evaluation findings through presentations at national conferences, including the American Education Research Association, National Science Teachers Association, and at www.InformalScience.org.  The project's evaluation and research about the complexities of the cognitive and experiential factors that influence Hispanic girls' STEM identity development will contribute to the field's understanding of this subject and the larger efforts of broadening minority women's participation in STEM."

Though AI is a quickly emerging field of research with broad applications in the STEM workforce and industry generally, there are few curriculum standards or educational guidelines for introducing pre-college students to fundamental knowledge and skills relating to the field of AI.  This project will address the emerging need for greater guidance in this field by bringing together specialists in AI from academia and industry with specialists representing K-12 education to draft guidelines for teaching and learning about AI across the grade bands of K-12 schools. The draft guidelines will then be reviewed by a larger interest group representing specialists in AI and computer science, as well as representatives of K-12 educators more broadly and the general public. Feedback from this larger interest group will be used to refine the guidelines for broader dissemination.  In addition to  developing initial guidelines for AI education at the pre-college level, the project will create an online directory of resources that can be used by K-12 teachers to develop instructional experiences in AI for their students.<br/><br/>The project team is working in association with the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) to model AI guidelines after CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards released in 2017. The project Steering Team includes members of AAAI and CSTA, as well as broad representation of AI scholars nationwide and experienced K-12 teachers across all grade bands.  Efforts are being made to ensure that culturally relevant resources are identified and readily available to support implementation of the forthcoming guidelines with all student populations nationwide.  The project team includes a Steering Committee that guides the project, and a larger Working Group consisting of experienced K-12 teachers at all grade levels and AI specialists representing academia and industry.

This project integrates computation into high school physics courses.  The proposed work aims to rectify the mismatch between what is needed to engage students in 21st century physics and what is taught presently in high school physics classrooms. By working with and supporting physics teachers to integrate computation into their classrooms in authentic and equitable ways, this project aims to address this challenge. A detailed research plan that uses several lenses to investigate student learning and participation as well as how teachers design and adapt their instruction in computation will build on the collective understanding of the importance of, and methods for, integrating computation into the high school physics curriculum. A central aspect of this work is broadening participation in computation to students from historically marginalized groups, and studying how teaching practices can lead to more equitable participation in computation. The results of this research will be transferable to other institutions and could catalyze wider-spread adoption of computational instruction, including evidence-based activities and teaching practices, in high schools across Michigan and the US.<br/><br/>The project is a research-practice partnership between university researchers in science education, curriculum developers and researchers in physics, and high school physics teachers in Michigan.  The researchers are committed to integrating computation in high school physics and studying its effects in classrooms on learning, practice, and equity. The research plan involves two components: (1) a professional development program that equips high school physics faculty to engage their students in computation and (2) a comprehensive research effort that studies the effects of integrating computation in these classrooms using three mutually-enhancing strands: (1) Student Understanding, (2) Instructional Practice, and (3) Equitable Participation. The professional development program for participating teachers consists of two components: (1) an immersive, hands-on summer workshop and (2) sustained post-workshop support. In the summer prior to the new school year, teams of teachers from participating schools will be invited to a 5-day workshop in which they work together on computational physics projects that they will implement in the classrooms while learning to use a set of high-leverage instructional practices that enables students to participate in authentic ways. During the subsequent school year, teachers will be invited back for monthly, one-day mini-workshops to reflect on their computational physics instructional experiences, to ask questions and inquire about additional support, to bring problems of practice in for discussion, and to perform additional development with the support of the research team.  Through this professional development program, teachers will 1) develop expertise in the use of computational physics to model physical systems that are appropriate for the high school level; 2) engage in high leverage practices that encourage students' authentic engagement in the computational enterprise; and 3) analyze issues of equity integral to their computational teaching practice. Through this professional development program, the project will support at least 36 teachers in the mid-Michigan area to integrate computation into their physics courses, thus, impacting over 1000 students."

This specific project will build and pilot a Community Center Afterschool Program (CCAP) model for integrating computation across K-12 disciplines at three community centers and their three affiliated Kid City Programs (6 locations) serving high needs, Title I schools in Boise, Idaho. Motivation for this project is based on the national urgency of integrating computational thinking (CT) in K-12 STEM education, a lack of qualified K-12 computing teachers, and local needs of quality STEM+C programs for high needs students. The CCAP model focuses on student learning and teacher professional development (PD) through pre-/in-service teacher-led, project-based, integrated STEM+C hands-on inquiry projects. <br/><br/>Afterschool programs provide opportunities for thoughtful, reflective engagement in complex, integrated projects that require combined knowledge across STEM disciplines and applications of computational thinking (CT), which are needed for computational integration. The CCAP model uses STEM+C inquiry/projects as a bridge between informal and formal learning and as a means of teacher PD. Not only will this project address student learning and teacher PD in CT, it will connect informal and formal learning and extend teacher PD to classroom practice. Project goals include: 1) design and implement a CCAP model; 2) explore how to integrate CT in project-based, integrated STEM inquiry for 4th-6th grade students in afterschool programs; and 3) examine how engagement in such inquiry impacts students and teachers. The project teams will: 1) design at least four project-based, integrated STEM+C inquiry projects aligned with standards via iterative design-based research; 2) implement them in small groups of six students paired with two teachers; 3) train 24 pre- and 24 in-service Title 1 school teachers with 144 students."

The need for strengthening computational thinking within STEM education is now recognized as an important priority, but computational thinking receives little attention in our nation's classrooms. Most resources like this to date have been seen as add-ons to the curriculum and have not been widely adopted.  In collaboration with teachers, the project will create exemplar lessons that will embed computational thinking in scientific inquiry rather than teaching it as an isolated topic. In intensive summer workshops and afterschool meetings during the academic year, teachers will be engaged in their own adult-level computational thinking and scientific inquiry, to help them develop their own sense of what scientific inquiry and computational thinking are. Starting with the exemplar lessons, the project will work with the teachers to iteratively modify, implement, and refine those lessons.  The project research will investigate how and to what extent this approach enhances teacher and subsequent student understanding (through the lessons they have developed) of computational thinking and inquiry.  The project will directly impact 20 teachers in 3 schools, and over 1000 students. The resulting model of integrated curriculum and teacher professional development will be widely disseminated at professional conference for researchers and teachers.   The model of integrated curriculum and teacher professional development developed by this exploratory project will be developed for potential future scale-up.  Computing has become an integral part of everyday practice within modern fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning.<br/><br/>The project will research the effectiveness of teaching computational thinking by embedding it in the process of science inquiry rather than teaching coding and computational thinking separately and then imposing that on science inquiry. Instead of directly teaching coding, the project will introduce computational ways of thinking, such as algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, flowcharts, debugging, loops, etc., that can be used in the inquiry process.  The project will research if the prototype curriculum supports integrated computational thinking and inquiry, how the curriculum influences student perceptions toward computing and science inquiry, and how teacher professional development activities improve their computational thinking and influences their classroom practices.  The research will use a variety of research techniques, including think-aloud interviews, surveys, analysis of classroom video, classroom observations and field notes."

It builds on 50 years of informal education and outreach at the Alaskan Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, AK, which, since the 1960s, has been the Nation's only underground facility for research related to permafrost and climate.  The project has four components: (1) a nationally distributed 2,000 square-foot traveling exhibition; (2) exhibit and program enhancements to the learning opportunities at the tunnel; (3) programs, table-top exhibits and oral history research in 27 Native Alaskan villages; and (4) an education research study.  Each of these components will be evaluated over the course of the work.  By upgrading the displays at the tunnel, and by taking traveling programs to the villages, the work will extend the tunnel experience across Alaska.  In the villages the team will collect stories about climate change, along with samples of real ancient ice and permafrost.  These stories and materials will be used in the travelling exhibit which is expected to be at three museums per year for eight years.  <br/><br/>The research component of the initiative will build on the observation to date that the tunnel has provided thousands of visitors with an underground immersive environment where they learn about the science research being conducted and engage with climate-sensitive materials (e.g., permafrost, wedge ice, frozen silt, Pleistocene bones) using all of their senses.  It has been conjectured that their learning experiences are enhanced by interacting with real vs. replicated objects.   As museums often contain exhibits that are more likely to contain replicated and/or virtual objects and environments, understanding the impact that these different categories of objects have on learning is important. Using both types of materials, the project will investigate differences in their efficacy in informal science learning institutions related to climate change.  Real objects are postulated to have the following attributes that stimulate fuller engagement; they are (1) information-rich by virtue of such features as their texture, odor, and dimensionality; (2) at real-life scale; (3) authentic, i.e., original objects; and (4) often unique, i.e., have inherent value.  Research questions will explore the potential impacts on learning of these and related features.  Methods employed will be observation, video, and interviews of the public with a particular focus on visitor talk with respect to explanations and elaborations about permafrost, tipping points, climate change, and geological time."

To help the nation's teachers address this challenge, this project will develop and investigate the opportunities and limitations of Focus on Energy, a professional development (PD) system for elementary teachers (grades 3-5).  The PD will contain: resources that will help teachers to interpret, evaluate and cultivate students' ideas about energy; classroom activities to help them to identify, track and represent energy forms and flows; and supports to help them in engaging students in these activities.  Teachers will receive the science and pedagogical content knowledge they need to teach about energy in a crosscutting way across all their science curricula; students will be intellectually engaged in the practice of developing, testing, and revising a model of energy they can use to describe phenomena both in school and in their everyday lives; and formative assessment will guide the moment-by-moment advancement of students' ideas about energy.<br/><br/>This project will develop and test a scalable model of PD that will enhance the ability of in-service early elementary teachers to help students learn energy concepts by coordinating formative assessment, face-to-face and web-based PD activities.  Researchers will develop and iteratively refine tools to assess both teacher and student energy reasoning strategies. The goals of the project include (1) teachers' increased facility with, and disciplined application of, representations and energy reasoning to make sense of everyday phenomena in terms of energy; (2) teachers' increased ability to interpret student representations and ideas about energy to make instructional decisions; and (3) students' improved use of representations and energy reasoning to develop and refine models that describe energy forms and flows associated with everyday phenomena.  The web-based product will contain:  a set of formative assessments to help teachers to interpret student ideas about energy based on the Facets model; a series of classroom tested activities to introduce the Energy Tracking Lens (method to explore energy concept using multiple representations); and videos of classroom exemplars as well as scientists thinking out loud while using the Energy Tracking Lens.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This project will design, develop, and test a new professional development (PD) model for high school biology teachers that focuses on plant biology, an area of biology that teachers feel less prepared to teach.  The new PD model will bring teachers and scientists together, in-person and online, to guide students in conducting authentic science investigations and to reflect on instructional practices and student learning.  The project will also develop and test the outcomes of a summer institute for teachers and a website that will support the online mentoring of students and the professional development of teachers.  Outcomes of the project will include the development of a facilitation guide for the teacher professional development model, a website to support student mentoring and teacher professional development, a series of resources for teachers and scientists to use in working with students, and empirical evidence of the success of the new professional development model.<br/><br/>This full research and development project will employ a pre-test/post-test control group design to test the efficacy of a professional development model for high school biology teachers.  The professional development model is grounded in a theory of action based on the premise that when teachers are engaged with scientists and students in a technology-enabled learning community, students will demonstrate higher levels of achievement than those using more traditional instructional materials and methodologies.  The means of post-intervention outcome measures will be compared across treatment and comparison groups in a cluster-randomized trial where teachers will be randomly assigned to treatment groups.  The study will recruit a nation-wide sample to ensure that participants represent a wide array of geographic and demographic contexts, with preference given to Title 1 schools.

This project by Northcentral Technical College is located in a rural region of Wisconsin with many manufacturing companies desperate for engineers and skilled employees who have a science and engineering background. The need for a scientific workforce has become vital to strengthening Wisconsin's economy, but recruiting qualified personnel has been increasingly challenging. High schools struggle to get students interested in higher education and to think of themselves as potential members of the technical, manufacturing workforce. This project targets rural Wisconsin youth to provide them with learning opportunities and careers pathways associated with computer technology and engineering, both critical occupational areas across numerous industries. Northcentral Technical College, in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, six community-based organizations, and four school districts, will engage and prepare teachers and students to meet this challenge. As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM + Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning from early childhood education through high school (preK-12). <br/><br/>The University of Wisconsin-Madison will lead research efforts to determine to what extent, (1) informal learning environments increase interest and enrollments in formal high-computing technology and engineering courses; (2) how the implementation of near-peer and adult informal teaching and mentoring increases the near-peer mentor and participants' interest in pursuing postsecondary computing technology and engineering career pathways; and (3) how leadership and mentorship training of adults and high school students impacts informal learning opportunities. Further, the research will address three key questions: (1) Will drop-in, open-ended Maker (engineering and technology) experiences impact community perception of, and interest in, computing technology and engineering learning and careers?; (2) What do students who become Maker mentors learn about computing technology and engineering content, learn about themselves as Makers and STEM learners, and how does this participation impact their postsecondary learning or career trajectories?; and (3) What aspects of the community-involved Maker experiences are sustained beyond institutional intervention? This project will provide a model for regions with distributed, rural populations in building capacity for young people to develop skills and self-efficacy for participating in the emerging rural manufacturing STEM+Computing fields of the future."

Research has indicated limited digital technology use and engineering instruction among elementary teachers. This project addresses two of the seven ITEST guiding questions: student experiences with emerging technologies and instructional and curricular innovations. The Making Engineering Real (ME-REAL) project will develop and implement professional development (PD) to support teachers who work with high populations of underrepresented students in STEM to develop richer, more authentic STEM education through: (a) technology-rich instruction, (b) authentic engineering opportunities, and (c) the development of systems thinking skills. The project will provide guidelines for technology integration within elementary engineering contexts that can inform expectations beyond Virginia. These guidelines will also inform interventions involving secondary teachers to support the development and integration of more comprehensive and increasingly complex technology use within STEM instruction. The project impacts the competencies essential for students to be successful in STEM-related degree programs and careers and is focused on better preparing elementary and secondary science teachers, providing them with valuable instructional tools. Because of this project, students will have more opportunities to engineer within authentic contexts, use relevant technologies in ways that reflect the work of scientists, and think about systems critically. <br/><br/>Prior research indicates teacher beliefs must be elicited and addressed to support changes in instructional practices. However, the question remains as to the extent interventions that incorporate attention to beliefs leads to instructional change. Comparison of ME-REAL teachers' innovation adoption rates to adoption rates cited in other studies in which the intervention included modeling, practice, planning, and coaching, but not attention to beliefs will allow the determination of the extent attending to beliefs promotes instructional change and innovation adoption, especially in the domain of computer simulations. The goal of ME-REAL is to increase and improve 1) elementary teachers' instruction and students' engagement and understanding in the STEM domains of engineering, digital technology, and systems thinking and 2) elementary student science learning among traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM (e.g. rural, Black, Hispanic, low socioeconomic status). Through a delayed-treatment quasi-experimental design, the ME-REAL project will advance the understanding of (1) pedagogies (e.g. digital technology integration) and engineering contexts that effectively support elementary students' systems thinking, (2) PD that facilitates teachers' systems thinking, engineering understandings, and digital technology use, and (3) the extent to which attending to teachers' beliefs during PD promotes instructional change and innovation adoption. Results from this ME-REAL project have implications for designing curricular tools and scaffolds to develop students' critical thinking about systems in all STEM domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Suddenly, the graphs, charts, and diagrams that provide a quick way to gather information are no longer effective. This is a challenge that students with visual impairments face in classrooms today as educational materials are most often presented electronically. The current way that individuals with visual impairments ""read"" graphics is through touch, feeling raised dots and patterns on paper that represent images. Creating these touch-based graphics requires extensive time and resources, and the output provides a static, hard-copy image. Lack of access to graphics in STEM subjects is one of the most pressing challenges currently facing individuals with visual impairments. This is a concern given the low representation of students with these disabilities in STEM fields and professions.<br/><br/>This project investigates how to use new touch technologies, like touchscreens, to create graphics and simulations that can be felt, heard, and seen. Using readily available, low-cost systems, the principal investigator will investigate how to map visual information to touch and sound. This research builds on prior research focused on representing the building blocks of graphics (points, lines, and shapes)  nonvisually. In this project, the investigator will determine how to represent more challenging graphics such as charts, plots, and diagrams, nonvisually. The project will then explore the role of touch feedback in interactive simulations, which have moving elements that change with user input, making nonvisual access challenging. Finally, the projects extends the research to students with other disabilities, toward understanding the benefits and changes necessary for touch technologies to have broad impact. The project involves group and single-subject designs with approximately 65 students with visual impairments and focuses on the following outcomes of interest: students' graph literacy, percent correct on task assessments, time of exploration, response time, number of revisits to particular areas of the graphic, and number of switches between layers. Working closely with individuals with disabilities and their teachers, this work seeks to bridge the current graphical accessibility gap in STEM and raise awareness of universal design in technology use and development. <br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

Such a tool may be particularly important in the context of online education where teachers and students often do not immediately interact with one another. The educational video material will focus on natural sciences and math with the goal of improving STEM education. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation. It is co-funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition program in the Social, Behavioral, and  Economics Sciences Directorate. <br/><br/>Effective learning requires attention to the instructional material. By measuring attention from brain signals, both the efficacy of instruction and the performance of individual students may be assessed. Knowing whether and when students fail to engage attention is crucial for designing better instructional materials or to assist students on an individual basis. The basic hypothesis of this project is that effective instructional materials will generate similar EEG responses across attentive students. The investigators test this hypothesis for STEM educational videos to determine if learning can indeed be predicted.  Participants include ~180 undergraduates enrolled in City College of New York's Division of Science and School of Engineering. Educationally, participants also include 30 high school seniors from four diverse New York City high schools.  Similarity among students' responses to educational video will be measured as inter-subject correlation (ISC) of EEG activity. The project has three specific aims: (1) Validate ISC using instructional videos; (2) Test the link between ISC and traditional learning outcome measures; and (3) Develop a mobile application to help transfer ISC measures from the laboratory to the classroom setting."

Core partners in the MSPinNYC2 partnership include Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY) as lead, the Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Bronx High School Districts of the New York City Department of Education, and three other colleges in the CUNY system: York College, New York City College of Technology, and The Graduate Center. Additional partners include the College Now program at CUNY, the CUNY School Support Organization, and New Visions for Public Schools. The PERC program restructures 9th grade STEM courses to have 7 or 8 Teaching Assistant Scholars facilitate group work on a daily basis. TA Scholars are average-achieving, i.e., not honors, 10th graders who passed the course and the associated required state exit examination during the previous year and are concurrently trained in a TA Scholar course led by the same teacher as the 9th grade class. Pilot studies with PERC during the MSPinNYC project suggested that the program reduces failure rates, closes achievement gaps, and improves graduation rates. Based on lessons learned in the pilot studies with 9th and 10th grades in high schools in Manhattan and the Bronx, the MSPinNYC2 partnership is implementing PERC in nine high schools in Brooklyn and Queens, while expanding the program within three schools in Manhattan and the Bronx to incorporate all of grades 9-12 mathematics and science. A TA Scholar-to-College Pipeline supports TA Scholars throughout high school and prepares them for success in college. Students from PERC schools in all four boroughs who enter CUNY colleges are being mentored during the college freshman year, while STEM faculty and graduate students at the participating CUNY colleges are being supported to incorporate more student-centered pedagogies into freshman year STEM courses. PERC experiences are also being integrated into teacher education programs at the CUNY colleges. The research plan includes studying how PERC serves as a catalyst for school renewal, how the depth and sustainability of PERC implementation support scaling the innovation, how participation by teachers in PERC effects deep change within their practice, and how and why PERC experiences, as well as other forms of student support, lead to improved academic outcomes for students. The evaluation examines the fidelity of implementation and quality of the project's major components to provide formative evaluation, while the summative evaluation focuses primarily on assessing student achievement outcomes, their long-term academic success, and the overall diffusion of PERC into the secondary and post-secondary settings involved in the partnership."

To help the nation's teachers address this challenge, this project will develop and investigate the opportunities and limitations of Focus on Energy, a professional development (PD) system for elementary teachers (grades 3-5).  The PD will contain: resources that will help teachers to interpret, evaluate and cultivate students' ideas about energy; classroom activities to help them to identify, track and represent energy forms and flows; and supports to help them in engaging students in these activities.  Teachers will receive the science and pedagogical content knowledge they need to teach about energy in a crosscutting way across all their science curricula; students will be intellectually engaged in the practice of developing, testing, and revising a model of energy they can use to describe phenomena both in school and in their everyday lives; and formative assessment will guide the moment-by-moment advancement of students' ideas about energy.<br/><br/>This project will develop and test a scalable model of PD that will enhance the ability of in-service early elementary teachers to help students learn energy concepts by coordinating formative assessment, face-to-face and web-based PD activities.  Researchers will develop and iteratively refine tools to assess both teacher and student energy reasoning strategies. The goals of the project include (1) teachers' increased facility with, and disciplined application of, representations and energy reasoning to make sense of everyday phenomena in terms of energy; (2) teachers' increased ability to interpret student representations and ideas about energy to make instructional decisions; and (3) students' improved use of representations and energy reasoning to develop and refine models that describe energy forms and flows associated with everyday phenomena.  The web-based product will contain:  a set of formative assessments to help teachers to interpret student ideas about energy based on the Facets model; a series of classroom tested activities to introduce the Energy Tracking Lens (method to explore energy concept using multiple representations); and videos of classroom exemplars as well as scientists thinking out loud while using the Energy Tracking Lens.

The aim of this proposed project, by Virginia Commonwealth University and Smith-Kettlewell Institute, is to provide a new interface ""tSCRATCH"" for the programming environment to enable visually impaired students to be engaged in computation and computational thinking. This work has the potential to improve learning of computer programming for all students, but will particularly focus on providing equal and shared access to individuals who are visually impaired. The learning approach is to develop a non-visual interface for a learning application, Scratch, that takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of the haptic (physical) and auditory systems. The project will be evaluated by Praxis Associates, who will provide ongoing feedback on the project to the project team. <br/><br/>This work has the potential to improve learning of computer programming for all students, but it will focus on providing access to individuals who are visually impaired. The approach is to develop a tangible, non-visual interface for Scratch that takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of the haptic and auditory systems. It will adapt a low-cost tactile tile concept to represent program commands, along with a grid surface and other organizational structures, to ensure that programs of moderate complexity can be created. A key aspect of the approach is to allow users to manipulate commands as a group to enable chunking (i.e., grouping into a whole) of information for ease of manipulation and cognitive understanding. Multi-media instructional material will be developed by experts in teaching students computer programming who are visually impaired. Further, this intervention will explore the possibility of tScratch to be used alongside of Scratch in mainstream classrooms by the use of the tScratch prototype in a computer camp type setting. The assessment of the intervention will consider the change in both blind and sighted students' ability to apply programming concepts, share in teamwork, views of each other, and views of computer science."

The STEM+C program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning. Twin Cities Public Television in partnership with the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) and the University of Minnesota Learning Technologies Media Lab, will implement A National Connected Learning Model to Integrate Computing in STEM Learning with Middle School Girls. Even though technology is pervasive in modern life, women continue to be underrepresented in computer science (CS) study and professions. Decades of research suggest the issues that contribute to CS pipeline deficits are complex, and they begin early. Although girls and boys do not display a significant difference in their abilities in math and science, research suggests that the cause for the gap in CS is social and environmental. A contributing factor consistently mentioned in the literature is that girls often do not feel they belong in CS classes, because boy peers have more experience with the concepts being taught from exposure to coding outside of school. Furthermore, research suggests that CS courses can isolate girls by their very design with: 1) curriculum that is irrelevant; 2) pedagogies that discourage collaboration; 3) lack of opportunities to take risks and make mistakes; and 4) heavy reliance on lecturing instead of hands-on, project-based learning. Connected learning pedagogy, where youth make things, work on projects they find personally relevant, and have open access to project tools and materials, addresses these issues head-on. Likewise, designing experiences for girls that employ best practice strategies for gender equitable teaching can help diminish the gap in CS. SciGirls Code will offer the CS education field a new model for using digital media to empower girls, role models, and STEM educators, ultimately enriching and supporting girls' pursuit of CS in academic settings.<br/><br/>This two-year pilot program will use principles of connected learning with 16 STEM outreach partners to provide girls and their leaders with computational thinking and coding skills. Findings will inform scale-up within the broader network of girl-serving STEM programs nationwide. Project goals are to: 1) spark and strengthen girls' interest, skills, and confidence as technology creators before high school, when attitudes and academic choices can influence postsecondary CS studies and careers; 2) support girls' efforts by training educators and role models in best practices for engaging girls in gender equitable STEM education; and 3) contribute to the field by researching the connected learning model for out-of-school learning of CS. These goals will be reached by the following activities: a nine-month curriculum centering on three tracks, including e-textiles and wearable technology, robotics, and mobile geospatial technologies; role model training for women technology professionals; professional development for STEM educators; and a research component to inform program success, impact and refinement. The project is grounded in a connected learning approach, which is based on social learning theory, that postulates that the active support of trained educators and role models will boost the development of middle school girls' computational thinking skills, attitudes towards computing pathways/careers, and understanding/appreciation of how participation in technology creation impacts themselves and the world around them."

A Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach will be employed to study outcomes relating to three research questions:  a) What aspects of the TPBP curriculum and informal learning environment most effectively support students' STEM competencies and dispositions, including: multimodal literacy and 3D design for diverse learners, fabrication skills, collaboration and innovation, and self-efficacy and persistence?  b) In what ways and to what degree do STEM Professionals, serving as Makerspace mentors, influence students? awareness of and interest in STEM careers?  And c) What aspects of the Critical Making experience focused on tactile books most effectively engage and support underrepresented learners, including girls, minorities and students with visual impairments, in 3D design and fabrication activities, and in developing STEM attitudes and interests?  The project incorporates two tiers of mentors to support critical making experiences in libraries: a) High School Mentors, recruited from partner schools, and b) STEM Professionals, recruited from partner Maker groups.  Accessible tactile pictures created through the project will be distributed to families with blind children via Colorado's Talking Books Library, integrated into public libraries' Sensory Storytimes (designed for children with sensory processing issues and autism), and the 3D designs will be made available online to support widespread production of accessible materials for young children.

This three-year project will bring together a team of researchers, Maker program developers from New York Hall of Science, educators with expertise in supporting students with ASD, and students on the autism spectrum to create a hybrid formal/informal program that prepares middle-school students with and without ASD for careers as inventors, designers, and engineers. The goal is for the program to be sustainably implemented in New York City's ASD inclusion middle schools by educators in those schools. Not only will this project benefit students, educators, and staff in the largest and most diverse ASD inclusion program in the country, it also will serve as a model of collaborative program development and implementation that other ASD inclusion programs in urban school districts can follow. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics contributing new knowledge about how theoretically grounded, research-based techniques for supporting students with ASD can be incorporated into Maker programs, and how to implement such programs in formal and informal inclusion education settings. This will expand our understanding of design and engineering workforce preparation for middle school students with ASD, provide a model for how to translate informal STEM programs to school-based environments, and demonstrate how such cross-setting programs can be tailored by stakeholders to various educational contexts. The resources made available through this project will support the adaptation of the program by other districts.<br/><br/>The researchers will use Clements' (2007) Curriculum Research Framework to structure a collaborative co-design approach, organized around the following phases of work. Phase 1: Collaborative program redesign. Test and redesign a museum-based Design and Fabrication Make Academy afterschool program to include techniques for supporting students with ASD, and to add classroom and lunchtime components to the afterschool program. Phase 2: Pilot test and revise. Conduct a pilot test of the redesigned program and research instruments in three inclusion middle schools, and make revisions based on findings. Phase 3: Research study. Implement the revised program and conduct research that examines whether it shows promise for (a) helping program participants learn the Engineering Design Process, (b) increasing the science and engineering interest and career motivation of program participants, and (c) creating a sustainable program and implementation process for urban ASD inclusion programs."

The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of this study lie in two complementary contributions of the project. First, the development of the statistical framework for the design of multilevel mediation studies has significant potential for broad impact because it develops a core platform that is transferable to other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education areas and STEM disciplines. Second, the development of software and curricular materials to implement this framework further capitalize on the promise of this work because it distributes the results in an accessible manner to diverse sets of research and practitioner groups across STEM education areas and STEM disciplines. Together, the components of this project will substantially expand the scope and quality of evidence generated through mathematics professional development and, more generally, multilevel mediation studies throughout STEM areas by increasing researchers' capacity to design valid and comprehensive studies of the theories of action and change that underlie research programs.<br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive framework to inform and guide the analytic design of teacher professional development studies in mathematics. The proposed framework incorporates four integrated research and education components: (1) develop statistical formulas and tools to guide the optimal design of experimental and non-experimental multilevel mediation studies in the presence of measurement error, (2) develop empirical estimates of the parameters needed to implement these formulas to design teacher development studies in mathematics, (3) develop free and accessible software to execute this framework, and (4) develop training materials and conduct workshops on the framework to improve the capacity of the field to design effective and efficient studies of teacher development. An essential goal of the research is to advance a science of teaching and learning in ways that traverse both research and education."

LinCT will guide teachers to develop their understanding and use of technology in the classroom, as well as prepare youth for a future where technology plays a key role in a wide range of professional opportunities. The project aims to inspire teachers and youth to see the possibilities of technological competencies, as well as why the incorporation of technology can build meaningful learning experiences and opportunities for all learners. The LinCT program model offers learning and application experiences for participating teachers and youth and provides an introduction of technological tools used in SMM educational programs and professional development on approaches for engaging all learners in STEM. Both groups will provide instruction in SMM technology-based Summer Camps, reaching 1,000 young people every year. In each following school year, project educators will develop and deliver technology-based programs to nearly 1,000 under-served and underrepresented elementary students. The project will allow teachers and youth to deliver exciting and engaging technology-based programs to nearly 4,000 diverse young learners. As a result, all participants in this project will be better equipped to incorporate technology in their future careers.<br/><br/>The LinCT project will investigate effective approaches for broadening the participation of underrepresented populations by providing female pre-service teachers and female youth with opportunities to lead programming at the Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM). Over three years, the LinCT project will employ 8-12 female teachers-in-training [Teacher Tech Cadres (TTC)] and 12-24 female youth [Youth Teaching Tech Crews (Y-TTC)] from demographics that are underrepresented in STEM fields. The integration of these groups will result in relationships fostered within an educational program, where all participants are learners and teachers, mentors and mentees. The results of this unique program model will be assessed through the experiences of this focused professional learning and teaching community. The LinCT research study will focus on three aspects of the project. First, it will seek to understand how the teachers-in-training and youth experience the project model's varied learning environments. Next, the study will explore how the TTC's and the Y-TTC's motivation, confidence, and self-efficacy with integrating technology across educational settings change because of the program.

Anecdotal information suggests participation in and access to informal STEM learning opportunities in Mississippi - a state with among the lowest STEM-career readiness in the nation - is unequally distributed among geographic regions and sociocultural environments. Informal learning programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) have the potential to reach into rural communities and provide a bridge to greater STEM access, literacy, and career readiness. Building Bridges: Broadening the STEM Conversation in Rural Mississippi will initiate a dialog among key practitioners, experts, and stakeholders in informal STEM learning focused on identifying the causes of and solutions to STEM inclusion barriers among rural youth. The goal of this Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Conference Project aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science for all segments of society, including rural K-12 students. Solutions to STEM disconnections identified in Mississippi through this project will have relevance and transferability to rural communities across the southeastern US, given regional commonalities in socioeconomic, educational, and cultural factors. <br/><br/>This project aims to conduct an interactive and participant-based summit that brings together key leaders and experts from informal science learning institutions and organizations, STEM-related agencies and industries, and rural community groups to improve methods for linking informal STEM learning opportunities with rural, K-12 students. The goal of the project is to identify the common barriers and explore potential solutions to informal STEM participation by rural K-12 students in Mississippi. With the guidance of a steering committee, a Mississippi STEM Consortium will be formed and convened at a 2019 Mississippi Informal STEM Consortium Summit with the following goals: (1) Identify broad barriers to informal STEM learning in diverse and rural K-12 populations. (2) Define crucial and transformative elements in informal STEM programs deemed successful in rural student recruitment and engagement. (3) Improve collaborative networking to enhance the role of informal education in building statewide STEM capacity. These objectives will be met by developing, implementing, and evaluating statewide needs-assessment surveys and a two-day summit of Consortium members. The project evaluator will ensure process and outcome evaluations are properly conducted throughout the entire course of the project to inform planning, promote iterative improvement, monitor progress, and ensure achievement of desire objectives. With regards to broader impacts, it is anticipated that outcomes from this project will have impact within and beyond Mississippi's borders. Expected project outcomes include scientific manuscripts on needs-assessment surveys, modified approaches to existing informal STEM activities, future research on identified informal STEM participation barriers and mitigation measures, new collaborations that broaden participation and expand future research, and a draft Informal STEM Strategic Plan for Mississippi. Varied dissemination methods will be used to communicate the findings broadly.<br/><br/>This conference project is funded by the AISL program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

Several varieties of ""making"" have been developed, but there are still many important questions to ask and research to conduct about how different programmatic structures may relate to the potential impact Maker programs can have on individuals and communities.  As part of a larger, long-range initiative in their local community, the New York Hall of Science proposes to leverage the philosophy and activities of the Maker movement to take important first steps toward realizing their eventual goal of developing family and community-wide commitment to and improvement of STEM education. The project would build both foundational and practical knowledge about how parents with little or no prior knowledge of or experience with Making choose to engage with, contribute to, and learn from Maker programming designed for families with children from low-income households and backgrounds that are under-represented in the STEM professions. The intent is to build their understanding of the value of Making as a pathway toward deeper STEM learning. The project is characterized as ""high-risk with potentially high-payoff.""  It applies a community psychology approach (rather than individual psychology) to the study of Making, and it focuses on parents as potential learners and leaders. While some work has been done in the field with respect to the role of parents in Maker environments, this is a new approach to the study of Making and its potential influence on the broader culture of STEM learning in a community.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The study poses two research questions: (1) How, and to what extent, do the Learning Together and Family Making programs attract and sustain parental engagement, parental facilitation of children's activity, and parents' own explorations of Making? (2) From a community psychology perspective, what social structures, resources, social processes, and surrounding institutional conditions support or impede these parental pathways into exploring and understanding Making as a pathway toward STEM learning?  The study will involve sustained collaborations between the Hall's Maker Space staff and research team, and will seek to generate guidance about how to design Maker programming that attracts and retains low-income, under-served family groups and new knowledge about how external structures and practices shape this audiences' perceptions of and interest in Making as a mode of STEM learning."

This project builds on the successful Portal to the Public (PoP) framework, bringing together the expertise and resources of HEIs and ISEs around the shared mission of engaging public audiences in current STEM research. The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. These established structures will lower the barrier to entry for PIs who want to do public outreach BI.<br/><br/>b.  Design, test, and study structures for long-term, mutually beneficial HEI-ISE partnerships: The project will build on the proven PoP model to create flexible, disseminatable tools around the development of institutional partnerships at three collaborating HEI-ISE site pairings that consider each institution's resources, constraints and strategic goals, including a cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary Broader Impacts Design (BID) Team structure. Sustained partnerships will support ongoing public engagement with current STEM research.<br/><br/>c.

Students become inspired and drawn into the study of STEM as they watch their creations become reality. <br/><br/>The mathematics, engineering and science modules developed in this partnership promote inquiry and situated learning which contextualizes STEM topics to demonstrate their relevancy to AMP-IT-UP students. Through extracurricular local and national clubs and competitions, student experiences are broadened and deepened. The clubs include Junior Makers and Innovation clubs that are mentored by GT faculty and students. This mentorship provides role models for the students and provides the personal touch that is so critical for student retention and self efficacy. The competitions include robotic competitions such as FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Robotics. Approximately 2,400 students each year participate in the exploratory STEM course modules with a total of approximately 1,200 participating in the extracurricular activities. <br/><br/>AMP-IT-UP is conducting research into various aspects of the impact of the STEM-ID courses on the students and their teachers. Some of the effects being measured include exploring how participation affects academic engagement, content understanding, knowledge transfer and student persistence in STEM.

Mathematics anxiety describes the feeling of fear and apprehension experienced prior to or during math related activities. It is a highly prevalent emotion in the student population. Highly math anxious students, compared to their low math anxiety counterparts, exhibit lower math achievement and less interest in math-related career paths. To understand more precisely why and how mathematics anxiety may hinder the development of mathematics ability, this project will (1) investigate the real-time impacts of mathematics anxiety on math problem solving; (2) examine the long-term impacts of mathematics anxiety on engagement in math learning in and out of school; and (3) explore possible individual characteristics that may mitigate the negative implications of mathematics anxiety on math learning outcomes. The project is supported by a CAREER award to Texas Tech University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to further our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the negative association between mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievement. Ultimately, this knowledge will provide opportunities to improve the quality of emotional experiences and knowledge acquisition in math education. This project will integrate methodological approaches from cognitive-affective sciences, educational sciences, psychophysiology, and developmental psychology into a 3-year longitudinal design, following students from upper elementary school into middle school. First, this project will test the hypothesis that mathematics anxiety impairs math performance by undermining goal-driven attention needed for successful math problem solving. The researchers will examine continuous attention distribution patterns (measured by eye movement) during math problem solving in students with varying levels of mathematics anxiety. Second, the researchers will examine the longitudinal relation between mathematics anxiety and mathematics attainment, with the hypothesis that avoidance and disengagement in math learning mediate this developmental relation in multiple contexts, in class, at home, and in out of school math activities. Third, researchers will incorporate electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and questionnaire measures to explore state and trait emotion regulation and effort mobilization as possible mechanisms in uncoupling undesired math learning outcomes from mathematics anxiety. Through finding dissemination as well as education and outreach programs, this project will offer the opportunity to promote public understanding of mathematics learning in particular, and to educate parents and teachers to become better consumers of the science of learning in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will address the long-term need to help teachers prepare more students to excel in STEM fields.  The project will meet this need through integrated science instruction that will help students to link learning to the real-world context, which research shows will help increase their interest, motivation, and persistence in STEM careers. The project will: (1) engage in-service science and technology teachers in professional development to build STEM knowledge and practices to enhance integrated STEM instruction; (2) establish a sustainable community of practice of STEM teachers, researchers, industry partners, and college student mentors; (3) engage students in STEM learning through engineering design and 3D printing and scanning technology; and (4) generate strategies to overcome barriers for students in rural schools and underserved populations to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The project will use real-world exemplars as the foundation for integrating entomology and engineering design to investigate the development of 21st skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and computational thinking) in STEM for teachers and students. To prepare teachers for this challenge, professional development will be based on a community of practice model that involves training, curriculum modification and adaptation, and lesson planning on integrated instruction. The project will examine the influence of these efforts on students' ability to design, test, and develop products and artifacts to help them make real-life connections to the world in which they live. Because students in rural communities have few role models, STEM faculty and their graduate and undergraduate students from Purdue University and Ivy Tech Community College, along with local community stakeholders and business leaders, will team with 45 high school teachers and more than 2000 students in an authentic learning context of design and discovery learning. This approach will afford teachers and students from 21 schools in rural Indiana with access to experts from STEM disciplines through technology-rich pathways, face-to-face interactions, and follow-up in-class support. The findings from this study will inform theory about authentic ways to reduce barriers for students in rural areas that continue to hinder their access to instruction shown to be effective in advancing 21st knowledge and skills.  Results from this study will also help increase students' interest in and motivation for careers in STEM fields."

Using satellite-enabled tools, the topology of an area can be mapped in detail and assessed for use thus enabling science education for both adults and high school students. The studies will involve intergenerational learning which is an area needing additional study. Also, the proposers are going to broaden the scope so that it impacts several different areas in the State of Connecticut.

The goals are to: (1) develop particular STEM knowledge and skills, and foster STEM identity authoring/learning in two disparate groups of lifelong learners, and (2) gain a deeper understanding of the ways that this learning occurs through research and evaluation. The project will develop an educational program that focuses on conservation science and recent advances in web-enabled geospatial technologies (geographic information systems, remote sensing, and global positioning systems) that, for the first time, make these technologies accessible and attainable for the public. The focus will be on urban and rural areas with underrepresented populations of STEM learners.

This Change Makers project will establish Food Justice Ambassador corps across three cities in Massachusetts where youth will install, manage and learn the science and technology underlying hydroponics. The project takes a near-peer mentoring approach that empowers high school youth to take the lead in improving ethnic minority and low-income residents' access to healthy produce and to help educate middle school youth regarding the value of fresh produce in one's diet by learning the science of hydroponics. Youth will create story maps to visualize food accessibility in their communities. High school youth will work with their communities to establish hydroponic farms in middle school after-school settings. The food that is grown will be provided to the community through farmers' markets. Youth will share their work with a larger community of urban farmers at the Massachusetts Urban Farming Conference.<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the contribution on youth development by the model's three components: (1) STEM learning embedded in a social justice framework, (2) near-peer mentoring, and (3) youth purpose and career development. This will enable researchers  to better understand how the project enables youth to learn STEM skills; apply them to a real life problem; learn the relevance of STEM skills for addressing personal, career aspiration, and social justice issues; develop a sense of purpose and aspirations related to STEM fields; and mentor other youth through the same process. The project will use a mixed-method, multi-site longitudinal study utilizing quantitative surveys, structural equation modeling, and qualitative interviews to study the intersections of the components of the project. As such, the study will address three key questions:  1) How do youth and mentors perceive and experience their roles as participants in the pedagogy?  2) What is the impact of the intervention on youth' sense of purpose, identity, career adaptability, work volition, critical consciousness, school engagement, STEM interests, and STEM intentionality?  3) What is the contribution of relational/mentoring and psychosocial/career adaptability aspects of the youths' contexts on their capacity to benefit from this program and to develop and sustain purpose and engagement in school and STEM? <br/><br/>Most urban youth (and adults) have little knowledge of where their food comes from and have limited opportunities to learn how to grow produce as well as develop related skills that can lead to a career in a STEM field. This is particularly disconcerting as 55% of African Americans live inside central cities (90% in metropolitan areas) and over half of all Latino/as live in central cities (United States Census Bureau, 2011). This project entails the recruitment of low-income youth from populations underrepresented in science into a program where social justice concerns (food justice, food security) are illuminated, analyzed, and acted upon through the development of STEM knowledge and skills. Specifically, this project recognizes the potential for urban youth to become deeply knowledgeable citizens who can mobilize their STEM knowledge and skills to resolve social injustices such as food deserts. If successful, this project will provide a model that should be transferable to similar contexts to help broaden participation in STEM."

This project addresses the critical need for well-prepared elementary teachers to have confidence in and a commitment to engaging their students in experiential learning of essential scientific and engineering concepts in the early grades.  The TEC-STEM-ETP is a Partnership among Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the State of Iowa, and Iowa State University, with the School of Education, the College of Engineering, the Engineering and Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC), and the Center for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education (CESMEE) working in collaboration.<br/><br/>Designed to make lasting changes to the elementary teacher education program at Iowa State University (ISU), this project will: 1) align ISU elementary teacher education STEM curricula with state and national standards, and incorporate engineering design into the elementary teacher education program; 2) create a program for pre-service and in-service teachers to work in partnership with ISU Master's level engineering graduate students (TEC-STEM Fellows) on a regular weekly basis during the student teaching semester; 3) infuse engineering concepts into the elementary school curriculum in the Des Moines Public Schools; and 4) create a dual-listed undergraduate/graduate course, Engineering and Public Outreach, for engineering students. TEC-STEM-ETP utilizes a novel triad approach, consisting of a pre-service teacher, an in-service teacher and a Master's level engineering student to work collaboratively in a 3rd through 5th grade classroom to teach science well, and implement engineering concepts, mathematics and technology as recommended by the Next Generation Science Standards and required by the Iowa Core Curriculum. The involvement of engineering students in working with elementary pre- and in-service teachers, their students, schools and the community, as well as the Master's level Engineering and Public Outreach course addresses a secondary but important intent of this project to develop communication and public engagement skills of fledgling engineers. The research agenda of TEC-STEM-ETP will determine the effectiveness of this approach to improve elementary teachers' STEM practice and efficacy and to determine reciprocal effects on the engineers.  Thus this project stands to make a contribution at the local level, in that there will be an innovative elementary teacher preparation program involving engineering as a legacy. It will also make a national contribution to educational/organizational research as the evidence of the impact of this work, which engages STEM disciplinary faculty members (Environment Physiology, Agriculture and Biological Engineering, Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering) working with education faculty and school district personnel, is studied during its development and implementation."

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. This project will focus on understanding why girls and women who are initially the most invested and motivated to succeed in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) domains, are ironically the most likely to leave these domains. The research specifically will examine a social context that has received little research to date: Problem Based Learning (PBL). With the PBL approach individuals work on problems together in dyads or groups. Although this approach is gaining rapid popularity at all levels of education, the role that it may play in affecting girls' and women's performance and ultimately their identification with STEM fields remains unexplored. This research proposes that PBL settings may be threatening to at least one individual target in a task group. This threat may in turn spread to other women in the group--a phenomenon referred to as stereotype-based stress contagion--affecting all female group members' performance and memories of the situation accordingly. Using a multi-method approach that includes psychophysiological, neurological, and behavioral measures, the studies will explore how PBL settings may unintentionally create stereotype or social identity threatening contexts, i.e., stressful, physiologically arousing situations where negative stereotypes about women's math ability are salient. The studies also will investigate a series of downstream consequences of this process within individuals. For example, stress contagion may facilitate encoding of negative memories specific to the PBL context, even if group members were otherwise more resilient to threats. Importantly, negative emotional memories forged in PBL contexts may lay the foundation for learned aversions towards STEM domains that undermine STEM identification over time.<br/><br/>The research has five primary objectives: 1) Investigate whether stereotype-based stress experienced by one woman will spread to otherwise non-threatened male and female partners in interpersonal interactions, as reflected in synchronous neural, physiological and behavioral responses between two partners; 2) Assess whether stereotype-based stress contagion will engender worse dyadic performance and partner perceptions; 3) Determine whether stereotype-based stress contagion facilitates encoding of negative, stereotype confirming information among the partner placed under threat and her female interaction partner; 4) Examine whether stereotype-based stress contagion engenders learned STEM aversions that undermine feelings of competency among two or more stigmatized individuals in a group; and 5) Assess these processes in a highly unique but optimal real-world setting: High school freshman boys and girls who have chosen a STEM track and work regularly in Problem Based Learning contexts to solve STEM related problems. These studies will employ a variety of longitudinal, social and cognitive neuroscience methodologies, including EEG, psychophysiological and dyadic methodologies. This approach stands to provide a mechanistic understanding of how neural and psychophysiological biomarkers interact both within and between individuals to alter overt perceptions, behaviors and thus interactions between two individuals in PBL contexts; mechanisms that might otherwise be impossible to identify relying on behavioral or self-report measures alone."

Second, given a definition of replication, what statistical analyses should be done to decide whether the collection of studies replicate one another and what are the properties of these analyses (e.g., sensitivity or statistical power)?  Third, how should one or more replication studies be designed to provide conclusive answers to questions of replication?

More broadly findings from this project will have clear implications for theories of cognitive development, especially those pertaining to how knowledge is shaped by culture and experience. Focusing on ecosystems may represent an opportunity to not only increase engagement and achievement in science among non-dominant communities and Native youth specifically, but also advance effective learning for all communities. The primary deliverables for the project are conference presentations and research publications. However, the project will also develop additional resources freely available to researchers, educators, and the general public. These will include summer curricular materials and teaching tools, professional development workshops, practitioner briefs about research findings that can be used in professional development workshops and shared share more broadly, and evaluation reports.<br/><br/>A deeper understanding of cultural influences on conceptions of the natural world can serve to advance the educational needs of children, including children from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Project research will include two interrelated series of studies designed to expand knowledge about human cognition of complex ecosystems and the affordances of informal STEM learning environments in developing and supporting the critical 21st century skill of ecological systems level reasoning. The first consists of a series of experiments focused on ecological cognition and the role of humans in nature. The second consists of design-based research interventions in informal settings, summer workshops for youth and the communities, focused on ecological systems level thinking and socio-environmental decision making. The project will recruit and engage both child and adult participants from two broad cultural communities, Native Americans and European Americans living in urban and suburban communities, in part because it affords a sharp test of human-nature relations. Sampling from two different urban communities will avoid simple Native-non-Native comparative binaries and to conduct Native-to-Native comparative analysis. Based on results from this, the project will result in: 1) foundational knowledge about human learning and reasoning and ecosystems and environmental decision making, 2) culturally responsive models of learning and practice about complex ecosystems for indoors and outdoors informal learning environments, and 3) insights about research-practice-community partnerships. One important objective of the research is to broaden participation and close opportunity gaps for under-represented groups in STEM fields broadly and more specifically for Indigenous people. Members of Indigenous communities, who provide strong role models for other aspiring scholars, will be involved as postdoctoral fellows, research assistants and graduate fellows."

The work is a partnership of George Mason University, Yale University, Climate Central (a non-profit climate science research and media production organization), the American Meteorological Society, and NOAA and NASA.  This project will include four activities: (1) recruiting 200 TV more weathercasters nationwide (currently just over 100 are participating); (2) providing participating weathercasters with professional development activities and training on use of Climate Matters materials to help them become confident and competent climate educators; (3) developing and distributing to participating weathercasters timely, localized, broadcast-ready graphics and science information, when possible tied to local weather and climatic events, to make it easy for them to educate their viewers about the local relationships between the climate and the weather; and (4) research and evaluation activities to improve the rate of use and effectiveness of Climate Matters materials by weathercasters over time and to study the effect on learning about climate by the public.<br/><br/>Learning outcomes by the public will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental method with nationally representative surveys of the public, conducted twice per year over the course of the project. The guiding hypothesis is that there will be a dose-response relationship between the extent of TV weathercaster use of Climate Matters materials in a community (i.e., a media market) and change over time in viewers' understanding of the climate.  The development of Climate Matters is based on theories of informal and experiential learning.  The scaling up of the initiative applies methods derived from diffusion of innovation and social marketing theories."

This University of Nebraska at Omaha project, Biomechanics to Offer Diverse Young Minds Opportunities to Develop, Explore, and Learn STEM (BODYMODELS) will investigate a learning model that leverages the technology-rich and interdisciplinary context of biomechanics to enhance understanding of and interest in STEM occupations among students in grades 3-6. The project will provide a positive learning experience in using biomechanics to teach STEM that will lead to more positive perceptions about STEM among participating teachers and students. The learning experience in the project would have a strong future impact on STEM education in and around Omaha. The project will directly impact an estimated 1,500 youth, most of whom reside in the diverse Omaha Public Schools district. In addition, the project will help engage elementary teachers in the Omaha Citywide STEM Ecosystem, establishing long-term professional networks to support their teaching of STEM after the project period. The successful implementation of the BODYMODELS project will result in standards-based and culturally responsive curricular resources that can easily be adapted by elementary teachers across the country to reach students in diverse school contexts. The project team will also pilot a graduate biomechanics course for teachers in elementary education programs for possible replication by other universities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the BODYMODELS project is to use biomechanics as a context for increasing awareness of, interest in, and capability to participate in STEM education pathways among a diverse population of 3rd-6th grade students in urban Omaha. The project objectives are: 1) Train a cohort of 3rd-6th grade in-service teachers to become knowledgeable and effective STEM instructors who can confidently integrate technology enhanced biomechanics lessons into their school's STEM disciplines through learning core biomechanics concepts and culturally responsive, inquiry-based learning (IBL) strategies. 2) Empower the 3rd-6th grade teachers by helping them develop and pilot biomechanics lesson modules, hands-on activities, instructional methods, and personal implementation plans (PIPs) to enhance interdisciplinary, culturally responsive, and technology-enhanced STEM education at their schools. 3) Partner with organizations in the Omaha Citywide STEM Ecosystem to engage professionals in biomechanics-related fields to assist teachers in developing and refining their PIPs to include activities that are motivating to students, such as classroom visits from STEM professionals and/or field trips to STEM-related organizations. 4) Investigate the impact of the biomechanics intervention on teachers' and students' confidence in teaching and learning STEM concepts and their attitudes toward the STEM disciplines, as well as on student STEM content knowledge, with a focus on refining the instructional model to facilitate its adaptation and adoption in elementary STEM curricula nationwide. The project will develop and investigate the utility of a learning model that leverages the interdisciplinary and technology-rich context of biomechanics to teach cross-cutting STEM concepts to students in grades 3-6 and to engage students in using emerging technologies to conduct inquiry-based experiments. This new learning model addresses two key challenges: 1) expanding student interest in STEM careers by engaging them in inquiry-based activities that are relevant to them and 2) helping teachers customize IBL lesson modules to account for differences in teachers' biomechanics experiences, students' backgrounds, school districts, and course objectives. Students will be assessed to determine if the program positively impacts their attitudes towards, interest in, and motivation to pursue STEM careers as well as their performance on statewide science and mathematics assessment tests. The project will advance the understanding of how to offer IBL using biomechanics in a variety of elementary school contexts."

The project seeks to promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and access for learning experiences and careers in STEM. It provides middle and high school students opportunities and resources to immerse themselves in STEM activities throughout the year. The project has identified guidance counselors as an untapped resource. Counselors play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to informal learning opportunities and to educational paths into STEM careers. The project also enables multiple school stakeholders to effectively prepare students for a STEM major/career. This effort will benefit society by widening the path to high-demand, high-wage, high-skill STEM jobs and thereby improve the diversity of our nation's technical workforce. The project is a 3-pillar intervention strategy with 24 partner schools participating in a comprehensive 10-day (80 hour) summer institute to equip teams (each consisting of a counselor, a teacher, and a third school stakeholder) with the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and resources to act as effective STEM advocates. The project will facilitate a school-year networked improvement community (NIC) that connects teams within and across schools as research is being conducted to better understand and address underlying inclusion, diversity, equity, and access issues in STEM. The NIC process will allow the PIs to work with the teams to implement out-of-school-time STEM clubs to provide unique engineering design, project-based, and other hands-on experiences to 1,000 students throughout the school year. <br/><br/>The Strategies project will address the following questions.  What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences?  What factors and key experiences effectively promote awareness of STEM careers, motivation to pursue a STEM career, and persistence in undertaking education pathways to those careers, particularly among students from underrepresented populations? What strategies to engage principals, guidance counselors, and other school system administrative leaders effectively promote student and teacher adoption and effective use of practices and technologies that support STEM learning and career awareness, and what factors influence the outcomes of those strategies? The fundamental project goal is to enable female, underrepresented minority, and/or low-income middle and high school students to participate in sustained, intensive, hands-on STEM learning experiences that build technical knowledge and ability and that offer insights into different STEM careers. The project will enable students access to participate, make the impact of such experiences endure, integrate them with other school efforts, and purposely engage underrepresented students. The project team has significant infrastructure for the summer camps and an extensive network of partner schools, districts, and career and technical education consortia to assist in implementing and institutionalizing the strategies. Using a mixed-methods approach, the project team will examine program effectiveness on the development of technical skills and self-efficacy in students and on the practices of counselors and other team members. Each out-of-school-time STEM club will be outfitted with equipment, software, and using published curriculum materials to do challenging yet age-appropriate projects that teach basic concepts in design of experiment, analog and digital circuits, signals, electromagnetics, communications, controls, power and energy, microscopy, nanotechnology, photonics, algorithms, and programming. Scholarships will be provided to 228 students to attend existing STEM summer camps at the University of Illinois, where the students can explore different STEM majors and develop technical skills under the guidance of university faculty in high-tech instructional labs. The project team will investigate the synergistic effects of school year STEM clubs, university-hosted summer camps, and a NIC that includes counselors and teachers. The research is potentially transformative because it creates a new paradigm for advancing students' interest, self-efficacy, abilities, and pathways in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants will join other young women to take part in the Women's Hackathon @ CSUSM (California State University San Marcos). (A hackathon is an event that brings computer programmers and other interested people together to improve upon or build new software programs.) The participants will then participate in an after-school that focuses on computer programming, career education, team building, and the non-programming components of the software development process. The afterschool program will use a project-based learning approach that will extend the conceptual designs of project ideas proposed during the hackathon into real solutions, which will be presented by teams at a culminating public showcase.  The project will reach 180 high school girls over the 3-year duration, with a majority of participants being Hispanic girls. In the context of these program activities, project research will focus on understanding the process by which skills and interest are transformed into commitment to an ICT career, particularly for Latinas.  Project research findings will be widely disseminated to researchers and K-12 educators through educational research journals and education conferences.  The project will  disseminate its work to wider audiences through public and social media. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by researching effective strategies for engaging Hispanic girls and other youth in ICT and STEM.<br/><br/>The project's research goal is to study how the relationships among interest, competency, self-efficacy, identity, and values influence commitment to pursue an ICT career pathway for young women, especially Latinas. The research will address two overarching research questions:<br/><br/>1. To what extent does the extended Hackathon program foster and sustain participants' sense of self-efficacy and identity with ICT careers, and align their perceptions of ICT workforce with their values; and <br/><br/>2. To what extent do self-efficacy, identity, and values build on interest and skills to increase participants' commitment to an ICT career path.<br/><br/>The project draws from current social psychological and educational research, and integrates self-persuasion, social learning, social identity, and goal congruity theories. This literature has revealed that, in addition to interest and competency, persistence in domains such as computer science is strongly predicted by domain-specific self-efficacy, identity, and an alignment with and internalization of the values of that field or endeavor.  The comprehensive design of the research plan, if successful, will significantly advance basic research about commitment processes for individuals from groups underrepresented in the ICT workforce specifically, and STEM fields more broadly. Quantifying the impact of an extended program on downstream efficacy, identity and values processes will have a significant impact on potential modifications to existing intervention programs to increase their impact on increasing and broadening participation in ICT and STEM."

For the mathematics education community, computing offers an application of mathematics concepts that may strengthen teachers' and students' mathematical understanding; for the computer science (CS) education community, integration enables equitable access to computing education for all students; for state boards and districts, integration accommodates staffing and curricular constraints while targeting core learning objectives in multiple disciplines. Bootstrap is a nationally-deployed curriculum that integrates computer science and algebra. Bootstrap's current professional development (PD) program for math teachers is a 3-day in-person event which assumes that teachers are somewhat facile with algebraic functions. Both Bootstrap and the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  have observed that some teachers have a weak command of functions. School districts would prefer a shorter in-person PD to reduce staffing costs and increase flexibility. This project will use a hybrid PD model to address both needs. Simultaneously, the project will research ways to tailor the online content to be effective for teachers who differ in their understanding of functions, goals for pursuing PD, and interest in mathematics, computing, math/CS integration, and student thinking. This Researcher-Practitioner Partnership team includes Bootstrap; NCTM (specifically its Math Forum team, which has expertise in on-line training); Brown University; Swarthmore College; the Oklahoma State Division of Secondary Mathematics and Computing Education and school districts in Texas. A total of 270 middle-school math teachers---a majority from rural areas or serving Native American or Hispanic students in our partnering regions---will participate in Bootstrap PD under this project. Assuming typical adoption rates, these teachers should reach 6,000 students within the project period alone. Building Bootstrap content into the Math Forum will expose thousands of NCTM's teachers to the potential of integrated math/CS curricula.<br/><br/> The team will use design-based research to develop and deploy a hybrid PD model and online support community for Bootstrap teachers, augment Bootstrap PD to reinforce teachers' understanding of algebraic functions, and conduct quasi-experimental studies to inform the design of different pathways through the PD. This project will study how to develop teachers' understanding of CS while also strengthening their math proficiency. In particular, the project will explore the possibilities for CS to improve teachers' understanding of algebraic functions. The project also will study ways in which teachers' interest can be made visible and useful in improving engagement and learning in integrated CS and mathematics PD. The results should apply to integrative programs beyond Bootstrap, suggesting strategies to tailor PD to serve more teachers."

At the same time, the mathematics achievement of English Language Learners (ELLs) lags behind that of their peers. This project addresses a critical need, developing professional development materials to address the teachers of ELLs. The project will create resources to help teachers build ELLs' mathematical proficiency through the design and development of professional development materials building on visual representations (VRs) for mathematical reasoning across a range of mathematical topics. The project will study how to enhance teachers' pedagogical content knowledge that is critical to fostering ELLs' mathematical problem solving and communication to help support fluency in using VRs among teachers and students. To broaden the participation of students who have traditionally not demonstrated high levels of achievement in mathematics, a critical underpinning to further success in the sciences and engineering, there will need to be greater support for teachers of these students using techniques that have been demonstrated to improve student learning. <br/><br/>The project will use an iterative design and development process to develop a blended learning model of professional development on using VRs with a 30-hour face-to-face summer institute and sixteen 2-hour online learning sessions. Teachers and teacher-leaders will help support the development of the professional development materials. A cluster randomized control trial will study the piloting of the materials and their impact on teacher outcomes. Thirty middle schools from Massachusetts and Maine serving high numbers of ELLs, with approximately 120 teachers, will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment or control conditions. Using a two-level random intercepts hierarchical linear model, the study will explore the impact of participation in the professional development on teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching and instructional practice. The pilot study will also explore the feasibility of delivering the professional development model more broadly.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will design and develop a new K-12 classroom observation protocol for integrated STEM instruction (STEM-OP). The STEM-OP will be developed for use in K-12 STEM settings. While the importance of integrated STEM education is established, there remains disagreement on models and effective approaches for integrated STEM instruction. This issue is confounded by the lack of observation protocols sensitive to integrated STEM teaching and learning to inform research to the effectiveness of new models and strategies. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments. The STEM-OP will be designed to be used effectively by multiple stakeholders in a variety of contexts. Researchers will benefit from having the STEM-OP available for them to carry out research and continue to improve STEM education in a variety of ways. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments.  The STEM-OP and associated training materials will be available for use by other education stakeholders, such as K-12 teachers and district administrators, through a publicly available online platform. In brief, the STEM-OP will inform the instruction of integrated STEM in many contexts with the goal of improving integrated STEM education.<br/><br/>The primary product of this project is the new observation protocol called STEM-OP for K-12 classrooms implementing integrated STEM lessons. The project will use over 500 integrated STEM classroom videos to design the STEM-OP. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the STEM-OP will be a valid and reliable instrument for use in a variety of educational contexts. The research will explore the different ways that elementary, middle, and high school science teachers enact integrated STEM instruction. This study will shed light on the nature of STEM instruction in each of these grade bands and provide information building towards an understanding of learning progressions for engineering practices across grade bands. Research exploring how the nature of STEM integration changes from day to day over the course of a unit will provide critical information about the different sequencing and trajectories of STEM units. Examining how integrated STEM instruction unfolds over a full unit of instruction will inform the understanding of integrated STEM practices at both micro- and macro- levels of analysis. The STEM-OP and associated training materials will be available for use by other education stakeholders, such as K-12 teachers and district administrators, through a publicly available, which will be distributed via a publicly available, online platform that includes a training manual and classroom video for practice scoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will conduct research designed to deepen our fundamental knowledge about culture, experience, and ecosystems cognition and to develop innovative practices and approaches to support learning about changing ecological systems and environmental decision making. Work on cultural differences in the production of complex systems knowledge is severely lacking. This gap in knowledge may contribute to the continued reproduction of inequities in science education. More broadly findings from this project will have clear implications for theories of cognitive development, especially those pertaining to how knowledge is shaped by culture and experience. Focusing on ecosystems may represent an opportunity to not only increase engagement and achievement in science among non-dominant communities and Native youth specifically, but also advance effective learning for all communities. The primary deliverables for the project are conference presentations and research publications. However, the project will also develop additional resources freely available to researchers, educators, and the general public. These will include summer curricular materials and teaching tools, professional development workshops, practitioner briefs about research findings that can be used in professional development workshops and shared share more broadly, and evaluation reports.<br/><br/>A deeper understanding of cultural influences on conceptions of the natural world can serve to advance the educational needs of children, including children from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Project research will include two interrelated series of studies and is designed to expand knowledge about human cognition of (complex) ecosystems and the affordances of informal STEM learning environments in developing and supporting the critical 21st century skill of ecological systems level reasoning. The first consists of a series of experiments focused on ecological cognition and the role of humans in nature. The second consists of design-based research interventions in informal settings, summer workshops for youth and the communities, focused on ecological systems level thinking and socio-environmental decision making. The project will recruit and engage both child and adult participants from two broad cultural communities, Native Americans and European Americans living in urban and suburban communities, in part because it affords a sharp test of human-nature relations. Sampling from two different urban communities will avoid simple Native-non-Native comparative binaries and to conduct Native-to-Native comparative analysis. Based on results from this, the project will result in: 1) foundational knowledge about human learning and reasoning and ecosystems and environmental decision making, 2) culturally responsive models of learning and practice about complex ecosystems for indoors and outdoors informal learning environments, and 3) insights about research-practice-community partnerships. One important objective of the research is to broaden participation and close opportunity gaps for under-represented groups in STEM fields broadly and more specifically for Indigenous people. As in past research conducted by the project, members of Indigenous communities, who provide strong role models for other aspiring scholars, will be involved as postdoctoral fellows, research assistants and graduate fellows."

This project will engage high school biology teachers in developing and testing a novel approach to integrating computational thinking with the disciplinary content of a high school biology curriculum. The project will create a sequence of curriculum modules that teach students computer modeling skills using an intuitive visual programming platform as they produce applications to model fundamental concepts in biology, such as trophic pyramids, enzyme activity, ecological webs, genetic ratios, and biochemical cycles. These modules will be deployed in several school districts to measure the impact of the curriculum modules on student gains in computational thinking skills, mastery in understanding of biological systems, and interests in STEM fields and computation-based careers.  The outcomes of this project will provide insights into effective strategies for encouraging students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields to succeed in STEM and computer-based education and STEM career tracks. This project will also provide opportunities for STEM teachers to learn about computer modeling of natural phenomena and how to integrate computational thinking into the subjects they teach. <br/><br/>This 3-year, design-based research project will engage high school teachers in designing, deploying, and evaluating a modified, computation-infused high school biology curriculum. Teachers in seven high schools will work with the project team to iteratively develop, implement, and revise a set of curriculum modules for teaching selected components of a general biology curriculum.  The modules will employ computer modeling exercises using MIT App Inventor, an intuitive, visual programming environment that enables users to build apps for smartphones and tablets. Validated measurement instruments, classroom surveys, systematic observations, student-built applications, project team feedback, formal tests based on in-class and out-of-class learning, and performance on New York state exams will be used to gauge the effectiveness of the revised curriculum modules and to test the hypotheses guiding the project.  Quantitative analyses of learning processes and outcomes will be based on longitudinal measures of student and teacher attitude change, engagement, collaborative process, conceptual and procedural knowledge in coding and in biology, and student choices of STEM and computer course electives. Qualitative analyses will include an examination of pedagogical culture within the classrooms and content analyses of student artifacts, including in-class and homework assignments and coded audio records of collaborative activity.  The key hypotheses being tested by this project are: (1) Students will gain greater insights into the nature of real-world dynamic biological systems as they build abstract models and explore the properties of these models through visual programming in the App Inventor environment; and (2) The activity of computer modeling itself will increase student curiosity and motivation to learn more about computer science approaches to problem solving."

In this validation study coaches will be randomly assigned to either use the CQ-REF tool or coach in their usual manner. After one year, the CQ-REF's impact on teacher practices and student outcomes will be assessed. Outcomes of interest include teacher and student classroom behavior and children's executive function and ability in mathematics, literacy and science. Concurrently, an external evaluation team will examine how the coaching is being conducted and used, and participants' impressions of the coaching process.

For the mathematics education community, computing offers an application of mathematics concepts that may strengthen teachers' and students' mathematical understanding; for the computer science (CS) education community, integration enables equitable access to computing education for all students; for state boards and districts, integration accommodates staffing and curricular constraints while targeting core learning objectives in multiple disciplines. Bootstrap is a nationally-deployed curriculum that integrates computer science and algebra. Bootstrap's current professional development (PD) program for math teachers is a 3-day in-person event which assumes that teachers are somewhat facile with algebraic functions. Both Bootstrap and the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  have observed that some teachers have a weak command of functions. School districts would prefer a shorter in-person PD to reduce staffing costs and increase flexibility. This project will use a hybrid PD model to address both needs. Simultaneously, the project will research ways to tailor the online content to be effective for teachers who differ in their understanding of functions, goals for pursuing PD, and interest in mathematics, computing, math/CS integration, and student thinking. This Researcher-Practitioner Partnership team includes Bootstrap; NCTM (specifically its Math Forum team, which has expertise in on-line training); Brown University; Swarthmore College; the Oklahoma State Division of Secondary Mathematics and Computing Education and school districts in Texas. A total of 270 middle-school math teachers---a majority from rural areas or serving Native American or Hispanic students in our partnering regions---will participate in Bootstrap PD under this project. Assuming typical adoption rates, these teachers should reach 6,000 students within the project period alone. Building Bootstrap content into the Math Forum will expose thousands of NCTM's teachers to the potential of integrated math/CS curricula.<br/><br/> The team will use design-based research to develop and deploy a hybrid PD model and online support community for Bootstrap teachers, augment Bootstrap PD to reinforce teachers' understanding of algebraic functions, and conduct quasi-experimental studies to inform the design of different pathways through the PD. This project will study how to develop teachers' understanding of CS while also strengthening their math proficiency. In particular, the project will explore the possibilities for CS to improve teachers' understanding of algebraic functions. The project also will study ways in which teachers' interest can be made visible and useful in improving engagement and learning in integrated CS and mathematics PD. The results should apply to integrative programs beyond Bootstrap, suggesting strategies to tailor PD to serve more teachers."

It will implement and study an innovative approach, which has students learn biological explanations by modeling phenomena as biologists do. The approach directs students to think about structures, behaviors and functions in nature, and to write these out and discuss them. This study will explore in detail student reasoning while they do this and how they learn. The project has potential not only to advance the field's ability to measure student competencies that are valued in recent science education standards documents (e.g., NGSS), but also to advance the field's understanding of how student ""modeling ability"" develops in a particular discipline. In this way, it can provide an important foundation for other research on the learning of modeling practices in science. Moreover, because the innovations take place in an introduction to biology course and introduction to biology is required for a large number of college majors, the project can be transformative for a large number of students across the country. <br/><br/>This study will be conducted in a pre-designed undergraduate biology course across four universities, two public and two private, serving diverse populations. The aims are: (1) propose systems thinking skills needed by biology students, by (a) getting feedback from academics, and reviewing; (2) to examine more closely student thinking during their activities by (a) recording group discussions, (b) conducting clinical interviews with a subset of students, and (c) collecting student drawings in response to different prompts than they have used previously that help the instructors better understand what students are thinking; (3) conduct open-ended comparisons between other assessments and their assessments of student models; (4) compare outcomes when students are provided different visual representations as feedback (split-plot design); and (5) make comparisons between different demographic groups."

The partnership also includes supporting partners from the 11 Alabama Math Science and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) regional in-service centers, Madison County Schools, Scottsboro City Schools, Madison City Schools, and the Alabama State Department of Education. The vision of APEX is to promote significant gains in student learning by transforming secondary physics education throughout Alabama. APEX is serving as a comprehensive agent of change by successfully integrating cutting edge teaching practices within secondary physics programs, and it is directly impacting 25% of the physics teachers (with 41,000 students) throughout all Alabama school systems. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is transformation of the work of pre-service and in-service physics teachers as they gain a deeper content knowledge of physics and also employ effective pedagogical strategies based on physics education research. These teachers go on to apply that knowledge within their own classroom ""action research,"" and this serves as a catalyst to encourage teacher experimentation within their classes - while also encouraging the sharing of these findings with physics teaching colleagues. APEX builds on three components, each with its own subset of goals relating to the overarching project goal. The first component is a physics education center for teacher training that works toward:  (1) increasing the quantity of highly qualified in-service teachers and the number of underrepresented minority pre-service teachers; (2) increasing the depth and breadth of content knowledge, pedagogy, and instructional technology knowledge and skills; (3) promoting the development of the undergraduate physics teacher education programs at AAMU and UA-T; (4) implementing a cyber infrastructure resource repository for sharing and disseminating best teaching practices and lessons learned; and (5) distributing laboratory equipment to schools via the Alabama Science in Motion program. A second component builds on a physics teaching research program to promote and guide action research in the classroom, thus enhancing evidence-based best practices in these Alabama classrooms. The third component is a physics leadership development initiative that works with policy makers and administrators to encourage their broad support of physics teachers and programs. APEX's best practices, lessons learned, and research findings are being disseminated in journals of physics education, as well as being presentated at regional and national STEM education conferences."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Widespread, high-quality use of technology has great potential to transform today's mathematics classrooms and enable all students to develop a robust conceptual understanding of mathematics. Critical challenges are currently limiting the realization of this potential, and 69% of US Grade 8 students are scoring below proficient in national studies. In this 3-year Discovery Research K-12 Full Research and Development project, Teaching and Learning Algebraic Thinking Across the Middle Grades: A Research-based Approach Using PhET Interactive Simulations, the PhET Interactive Simulations group at the University of Colorado Boulder is partnering with mathematics education researchers at the University of South Florida St. Petersberg and Florida State University to address three central challenges, as follows: 1) the tendency for students to not engage in real mathematical thinking as they use technologies; 2) the tendency for teachers to not enact pedagogically-effective approaches; and 3) the lack of adoption of effective technologies by teachers due to a variety of barriers. This collaborative effort uses rich, exploratory, interactive simulations and associated instructional materials as a pathway for making rapid progress and focuses on advancing algebraic thinking in Grades 6-9.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to enable teachers to fully-leverage the benefits of interactive simulations to advance student engagement and learning of mathematics, moving technology from the margins to a core part of instruction. The project will answer critical research questions, such as: how the design of an interactive simulation can generate pedagogically-productive use; how instruction with simulations can be best structured to support learning of mathematical concepts and engagement in mathematical practices; how sim-based instruction can be made attractive, feasible and effective for teachers; and finally, how student learning is impacted by sim-based instruction. At the same time, this project will produce a collection of open educational resources for teachers and students. These resources will include 15 research-based, student-tested simulations for teaching and learning of algebraic thinking, associated instructional support materials, and teacher professional development resources for effective implementation. Based on the 75 million uses per year of PhET?s science simulations, we expect these resources to transform mathematics instruction for millions of students and thousands of teachers. <br/><br/>This project will employ a variety of research methods to approach these questions. Researchers will use individual interviews from a diverse group of Grades 6-9 students as they use the 15 new simulations to examine usability, engagement, and achievement and to identify design approaches that stimulate productive use. In parallel, classroom-based studies in Colorado and Florida will investigate ways in which simulations can be combined with instructional materials and teacher facilitation to engage groups of students in inquiry, promote rich discussions of important mathematical ideas, and advance achievement in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The project will employ an iterative design and development process involving qualitative and quantitative analysis of diverse measures including the quality of mathematical instruction. Finally, a pilot study and an evaluation of teacher PD supports will examine the feasibility and fidelity with which teachers implement the innovation, and the impact on student learning."

The ECR program is distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/><br/>High school algebra is the gateway to a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and can influence employability and wages in many non-STEM occupations. Students who struggle with or fail high school algebra have compromised occupational prospects, and nations that do not produce mathematically competent citizens may compromise their economic growth. Much is known about the factors that contribute to students' difficulties with arithmetic learning and interventions are being developed to address these difficulties. Little is known, however, about why some students struggle with algebra. Accordingly, the project will follow at risk students (including for example, those with dyslexia) from 7th grade through high school algebra and assess their prerequisite knowledge (e.g. fractions skills), cognitive systems (e.g., memory), attitudes and reactions to mathematics (e.g. math anxiety) and their attentiveness in math classrooms. The comprehensive evaluation of these students will allow us to identify the factors that influence difficulties in learning different aspects of algebra and risk of failing algebra more generally. The results will provide unique scientific insights into the cognitive and motivational influences on students' understanding and learning of algebra and identify areas for intervention with at-risk students. The results will also be used to develop a screening measure for the early identification of at-risk students and to identify specific areas for targeted intervention. The measure will be made freely available to interested school districts throughout the United States.  <br/><br/>The project is a 7th to 9th grade longitudinal assessment of the prerequisite (e.g. fractions), cognitive (e.g. working memory), and non-cognitive (e.g. math anxiety) factors that dynamically influence students' algebraic learning and cognition, with a focus on students with learning disabilities in mathematics. The study will provide the most comprehensive assessment of the development of algebra competence ever conducted and is organized by an integrative model of cognitive and non-cognitive influences on students' engagement in math classrooms and on the learning of procedural and spatial-related aspects of algebra. The focus on students at risk for failing high school algebra is informed by research on the number and arithmetic deficits of these students, providing continuity with previous work, and a strong a priori framework for assessing their most likely difficulties in learning algebra; specifically, we developed novel measures that assess different aspects of procedural algebra (e.g. memory for the structure of algebra equations) and spatial-related algebra (e.g. recognizing how common functions map to coordinate space) that will allow for the study of different types of learning deficits and a determination of how more basic cognitive abilities, such as visuospatial working memory, may underlie these deficits. Prior cognitive studies of at-risk students have largely ignored the contributions of non-cognitive factors, such as math anxiety, on their learning or how their learning difficulties change attitudes about and reactions to mathematics (e.g. increasing math anxiety). The proposed research will address this important oversight and integrate these non-cognitive factors with assessments of teacher-rated student engagement in pre-algebra and algebra classrooms (and language arts classrooms as a contrast) and how engagement in the classroom influences the learning of procedural and spatial-related algebra. The research will also provide a thorough analysis of cognitive and non-cognitive influences on algebraic learning and cognition more generally, and thus inform general educational practices. In all, the proposed research will provide a comprehensive model for the study algebraic learning and cognition generally, and will provide a comprehensive assessment of associated deficits of learning disabled students and students at risk for failing high school algebra. The research will also make available revised or newly developed cognitive measures of procedural and spatial-related algebra skills that should facilitate future cognitive science and educational studies of algebra learning."

Geoscience is a STEM discipline that is of growing importance to several national and global issues, including climate change, energy resources, and understanding earthquake activity. Expertise in geoscience depends heavily upon unconscious perceptual skills that are difficult or impossible to impart through traditional classroom education. Consequently there is a great need to improve or develop new methods for perceptual training (i.e., training students to visually detect, identify, and interpret geologic processes) and to study how educational practices in this area may be optimized. This project will apply a cognitive science approach to meet this goal, by conducting behavioral experiments involving geoscience students, and developing computational models of human cognition. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on the role of visual working memory (VWM) in perceptual learning and perceptual expertise in the geosciences. VWM is a cognitive system that is critical to the geosciences. For example, when a geologist views or studies a landscape, he or she acquires visual information from multiple points in the scene by making numerous eye movements. The geologist can then (unconsciously) use his or her VWM to integrate information across eye movements to develop a coherent representation of the landscape. While there is much existing research on VWM, very little is known about the relationship between visual working memory on the one hand, and fundamental changes in perceptual ability in specific domains such as geoscience on the other hand. The proposed research will build upon, and extend a recently developed model of human perception that has the potential to connect these two domains. This model is based upon information theory, or the mathematical study of how physical systems can efficiently communicate information.  This model suggests that training and expertise fundamentally change a person?s perceptual system in a way that leads to more efficient use of cognitive resources. In order to test this model, a series of behavioral experiments will be conducted involving novice and experienced students in the geosciences. These experiments and computational modeling efforts will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to improve geoscience and education."

Internationally, there is broad recognition that far too narrow a segment of the population is deeply engaged with and knowledgeable about STEM. This narrow engagement negatively affects the prospects of individuals across the globe. Diversifying the pool of children and young adults deeply engaged with STEM, and providing them with well-supported opportunities for deeper learning in STEM, will promote the progress of STEM by positively impacting research and development. Diversity of thought, perspective, experience and quality of preparation improve innovation and the quality of STEM research. The workshop and its products will advance STEM education by enhancing scholars' knowledge of relevant research on diversifying and deepening engagement and learning, and by creating stronger ties among researchers with common interests in and commitment to these issues. STEM education efforts sparked by this workshop will advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by improving individuals' quality of life and enabling broader public participation in democratic processes that are informed by STEM. <br/><br/>The workshop involves a select group of influential scholars from the U.S. and Netherlands whose work contributes to innovative research and development on STEM education both within and beyond schools. The workshop's theme refers to the key goal of diversifying the pool of young people deeply engaged with STEM, including groups historically underrepresented globally and in each nation, while also fostering deeper STEM learning. Throughout the workshop, participants will examine two questions: (1) What are the key social, cultural, and systemic contexts that facilitate and impede broadening STEM participation and learning? (2) How might researchers better understand them, and educators better address them? Comparative work across the U.S. and Netherlands national contexts will allow for bidirectional illumination of issues that might otherwise appear to be merely given or inevitable when examined from a single national standpoint. Gathered scholars will explore the challenges and opportunities for supporting and sustaining interest in, identification with, and deep learning of STEM among young people, through informal and formal learning opportunities. A key outcome of the workshop will be a white paper made freely and widely available to the STEM education community and the general public. The white paper will summarize existing literature and the discussion, framings, and suggestions for further research. The process of constructing and finalizing the white paper will focus the attention of participants in the workshop, and result in greater clarity about the body of theory and research that can inform educational action and future research. In addition, interest groups that form during the workshop will consider pursuing additional products that can inform the STEM education community, such as a journal special issue, an edited volume, research and practice briefs, or other collaborations."

As researchers attempt to uncover why some students are more likely to pursue STEM careers, they increasingly have focused on motivational and self-regulatory factors that have been shown to impact students' educational and occupational choices. One construct that some researchers have focused on is grit, defined as one's perseverance and passion in the pursuit of long-term, challenging goals. grit has become very popular in the scientific community and the national media, and some have argued that researchers and practitioners need to help students increase their grit. However, grit's validity, especially in relation to conceptually similar motivational and self-regulatory constructs, and for different ethnic and gender groups, has not been systematically explored. It is essential to establish grit as a valid psychological construct before designing grit-based interventions intended to enhance students' achievement in STEM and other areas.<br/><br/>The proposed study is a longitudinal validation study of grit and its relations to STEM outcomes. It will be conducted with an ethnically and economically diverse sample of middle and high school students. Students will be surveyed twice in 8th grade and once in 9th grade, and their levels of grit and other motivation, self-regulatory, and personality variables will be measured. Information about students' choices to take STEM courses, their grades in STEM courses, and their anticipated major in college will also be collected. Using sophisticated Item Response Theory (IRT) and other latent variable modeling procedures, grit's convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity will be assessed over time, and gender and ethnic differences will be examined. The project will be transformative in its use of sophisticated analysis strategies to examine grit's uniqueness from other theoretically based motivation and self-regulation constructs that have clear relations to STEM outcomes."

Geoscience is a STEM discipline that is of growing importance to several national and global issues, including climate change, energy resources, and understanding earthquake activity. Expertise in geoscience depends heavily upon unconscious perceptual skills that are difficult or impossible to impart through traditional classroom education. Consequently there is a great need to improve or develop new methods for perceptual training (i.e., training students to visually detect, identify, and interpret geologic processes) and to study how educational practices in this area may be optimized. This project will apply a cognitive science approach to meet this goal, by conducting behavioral experiments involving geoscience students, and developing computational models of human cognition. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on the role of visual working memory (VWM) in perceptual learning and perceptual expertise in the geosciences. VWM is a cognitive system that is critical to the geosciences. For example, when a geologist views or studies a landscape, he or she acquires visual information from multiple points in the scene by making numerous eye movements. The geologist can then (unconsciously) use his or her VWM to integrate information across eye movements to develop a coherent representation of the landscape. While there is much existing research on VWM, very little is known about the relationship between visual working memory on the one hand, and fundamental changes in perceptual ability in specific domains such as geoscience on the other hand. The proposed research will build upon, and extend a recently developed model of human perception that has the potential to connect these two domains. This model is based upon information theory, or the mathematical study of how physical systems can efficiently communicate information.  This model suggests that training and expertise fundamentally change a person?s perceptual system in a way that leads to more efficient use of cognitive resources. In order to test this model, a series of behavioral experiments will be conducted involving novice and experienced students in the geosciences. These experiments and computational modeling efforts will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to improve geoscience and education."

For the mathematics education community, computing offers an application of mathematics concepts that may strengthen teachers' and students' mathematical understanding; for the computer science (CS) education community, integration enables equitable access to computing education for all students; for state boards and districts, integration accommodates staffing and curricular constraints while targeting core learning objectives in multiple disciplines. Bootstrap is a nationally-deployed curriculum that integrates computer science and algebra. Bootstrap's current professional development (PD) program for math teachers is a 3-day in-person event which assumes that teachers are somewhat facile with algebraic functions. Both Bootstrap and the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  have observed that some teachers have a weak command of functions. School districts would prefer a shorter in-person PD to reduce staffing costs and increase flexibility. This project will use a hybrid PD model to address both needs. Simultaneously, the project will research ways to tailor the online content to be effective for teachers who differ in their understanding of functions, goals for pursuing PD, and interest in mathematics, computing, math/CS integration, and student thinking. This Researcher-Practitioner Partnership team includes Bootstrap; NCTM (specifically its Math Forum team, which has expertise in on-line training); Brown University; Swarthmore College; the Oklahoma State Division of Secondary Mathematics and Computing Education and school districts in Texas. A total of 270 middle-school math teachers---a majority from rural areas or serving Native American or Hispanic students in our partnering regions---will participate in Bootstrap PD under this project. Assuming typical adoption rates, these teachers should reach 6,000 students within the project period alone. Building Bootstrap content into the Math Forum will expose thousands of NCTM's teachers to the potential of integrated math/CS curricula.<br/><br/> The team will use design-based research to develop and deploy a hybrid PD model and online support community for Bootstrap teachers, augment Bootstrap PD to reinforce teachers' understanding of algebraic functions, and conduct quasi-experimental studies to inform the design of different pathways through the PD. This project will study how to develop teachers' understanding of CS while also strengthening their math proficiency. In particular, the project will explore the possibilities for CS to improve teachers' understanding of algebraic functions. The project also will study ways in which teachers' interest can be made visible and useful in improving engagement and learning in integrated CS and mathematics PD. The results should apply to integrative programs beyond Bootstrap, suggesting strategies to tailor PD to serve more teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is a partnership between the College of Education, the Math, Science and Education Network Pre-College Program, the Minority Engineering Program, and Technology and Engineering Education, all at NC State University, as well as four school districts in high poverty rural areas of North Carolina. This project addresses an important national concern of strengthening and diversifying the scientific workforce. This project could have significance by providing a transformative model that can potentially enhance STEM learning and engagement for underrepresented students living in rural areas of the U.S., thus greatly improving their chances for upward mobility. The project studies the effects of e-mentoring (online mentoring) on underrepresented student mentors and underrepresented high school students living in rural areas. The mentoring model and tools developed have the potential to impact all students, further contributing to the capability and diversity of future STEM professionals. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop and iteratively test an e-mentoring program for underrepresented high school students living in rural North Carolina that will engage them in engineering-related experiences supported by near-peer relationships with mentors of similar background, race, gender, and experiences, to improve students' attitudes about and participation in STEM. This project will employ a research-based mentoring model facilitated using mobile and web-based software technology. This three-year project will iteratively design, implement, and study the e-mentoring program by matching 100 underrepresented rural students with college engineering majors from the Minority Engineering Program and Technology and Engineering Education at NC State. Both high school students and student mentors participating in the program will benefit from a connection to the broader STEM community that will allow them to envision pathways to STEM careers. This project will report on factors that facilitate successful implementation of the e-mentoring experience, examine the potential promise of the e-mentoring experience for participating students, and determine factors that may moderate the potential of the e-mentoring program. By matching underrepresented students with near-peer mentors of similar background, experience, and interests, it is expected that mentees will improve in their self-efficacy and value for STEM, and their STEM intentions, enrollment, and persistence. The methods and approaches used for applying strategies of successful mentorship programs will leverage digital tools and an inverted classroom to enhance STEM learning and the mentoring experience. The project has the potential to expand upon the capacity of traditional mentoring and develop new avenues through which to enhance STEM identity, education, and the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops a Scaffolded Training Environment for Physics Programming (STEPP) in which students learn physics and cultivate Computational Thinking (CT) skills through state-based modeling by creating their own simulation tools. Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a method for state-based modeling and have been used to design algorithms and teach programming and engineering. The Unity game engine with Playmaker plug-in will serve as the platform for STEPP because of the low threshold for prior programming experience, the high ceiling for learning potentials, and the transferability to other applications. The project's hypothesis is that by constructing their own simulation tools, students learning in a scaffolded synergistic environment will master physics concepts and CT more successfully than students learning with pre-made simulation tools. The proposed research will provide new insights on how the use of dynamic modeling, implemented with cost-effective technology, can best help students understand physics concepts, develop CT, and improve their computing attitudes. By assessing improvements in understanding physics concepts, CT, and computing attitudes, this project will obtain information about relationships between these objectives which could indicate the advantage of synergistic learning.<br/><br/>Researchers will design and implement three Scaffolded Training Environment for Physics Programming (STEPP) modules with learning content that aligns with Texas's standards and the Next Generation of Science Standards. A summer institute will be held for inservice and pre-service teachers to learn and experience STEPP and incorporate it into their own curricula and assessments. The STEPP modules will be tested at a minimum of two high schools, with a minimum of 160 high school students and two physics teachers participating. Students' gain in physics knowledge will be measured by the Force Concept Inventory; their gain in CT, state-based modeling, and programming concepts will be assessed by rubrics developed in collaboration with high school teachers.

The project will use a design-based research process to research and develop an innovative theatrical game that will improve visitors' understanding of complex topics requiring conceptual change. This project will research a novel experience that helps visitors engage with difficult content in informal science education venues, uses existing exhibit and collection assets in a new way, and creates a venue for visitor engagement that requires less capitalization than a full exhibition project. For the public, this project will blend best practices from exhibit development, museum theater, and facilitation with emerging theories about game-based learning to create a novel experience that deeply engages visitors with an evolution storyline and allows them to explore the museum and interact with one another in new ways. For the field, the project will examine how theatrical games can be valuable, viable experiences in museum environments and what game mechanics and supports contribute to players' conceptual thinking. While the project's games with theatrical elements will focus on evolution, the tested strategies will provide valuable information about effective approaches for informal STEM education more broadly wherever audiences exhibit major misconceptions or discomfort with scientific ideas. The project will disseminate findings through conferences and workshops, academic reports, a research-to-practice implementation guide, and a training video about best practices for engaging the public in theatrical gaming.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the creation and modification of a theoretical framework that describes the content, program format, and degree of facilitation necessary to create experiences that support conceptual change in visitors' thinking about evolution--and, by extension, other complex topics. The project team and advisors will collaboratively will build varying levels of facilitation and challenge into theatrical programming that connects objects and experiences across the museum to help visitors construct a story of evolution. Project research will focus on the creation of three variants of a theatrical game to test a theoretical framework that describes the game dynamics and facilitation necessary for experiences that support conceptual shifts in visitors' understanding about evolution. This work will take place in four phases, and will be conducted by researchers at the Science Museum of Minnesota with input and review through an external evaluation process.  The questions guiding the research are: (1) How, and in what ways, do game design features support conceptual shifts in evolution concepts?; (2) Do player outcomes differ in each game? If so, in what ways?; (3) What other factors (player profile, collaboration, evolution beliefs) influence player outcomes? (4) What are the best practices for facilitating the games and supporting visitors' experiences? The research will contribute to the under-studied field of participatory museum theatre experiences; broaden our understanding of the roles facilitation and gameplay have in informal learning; and help exhibit and program developers make informed choices about the potential of various exhibit components and aligned programming."

The project will promote junior high and high school students' interest, skills, knowledge, and career aspirations in engineering through authentic engineering design activities related to building automation. The approach is to use connected devices (known as the internet of things) and additive manufacturing (3D printing) as the basic technological learning tools to be used by the junior high and high school students. The project will acquaint students to these new technologies in which the workforce of the future will need to be comfortable working with these connected devices, how new manufacturing processes work, and understanding the role these technologies can play in the modern enterprise. <br/><br/>The project will use the combination of teacher training, community outreach, industry support, and community college partnership to promote STEM careers among junior high school and high school students. The project plan consists of three main activities: 1) the incorporation of authentic design activities related to building automation and supported by industry professionals into junior high and high school classes; 2) the creation of summer programs for junior high school students to create connected devices; and 3) the creation of a dual credit course to be offered in high schools for community college credit using examples from building automation. The project will systematically evaluate the effect of authentic experiential learning activities related to engineering design on students' interests, skills, knowledge, and career aspirations. The work will also examine the effectiveness of a teacher professional development program in preparing teachers to implement authentic engineering design activities. Both the university faculty and industry representatives as collaborators, the project will examine the role these other professionals play in helping teachers overcome any doubts or apprehension they have in engineering design instruction. The project will allow a diverse group of students to learn about new technologies and STEM careers through authentic experiential learning activities and the participation of industry will allow students to better understand what engineers do and why math and science are critical to these technical professions.  The project partners with the Houston Independent School District (HISD), the largest school district in Texas and the 7th largest in the United States, and the proposed work will have significant impact with HISD and their 62% Hispanic and 25% African-American student population, allowing an underserved populations to learn about potential careers in STEM."

Geoscience is a STEM discipline that is of growing importance to several national and global issues, including climate change, energy resources, and understanding earthquake activity. Expertise in geoscience depends heavily upon unconscious perceptual skills that are difficult or impossible to impart through traditional classroom education. Consequently there is a great need to improve or develop new methods for perceptual training (i.e., training students to visually detect, identify, and interpret geologic processes) and to study how educational practices in this area may be optimized. This project will apply a cognitive science approach to meet this goal, by conducting behavioral experiments involving geoscience students, and developing computational models of human cognition. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on the role of visual working memory (VWM) in perceptual learning and perceptual expertise in the geosciences. VWM is a cognitive system that is critical to the geosciences. For example, when a geologist views or studies a landscape, he or she acquires visual information from multiple points in the scene by making numerous eye movements. The geologist can then (unconsciously) use his or her VWM to integrate information across eye movements to develop a coherent representation of the landscape. While there is much existing research on VWM, very little is known about the relationship between visual working memory on the one hand, and fundamental changes in perceptual ability in specific domains such as geoscience on the other hand. The proposed research will build upon, and extend a recently developed model of human perception that has the potential to connect these two domains. This model is based upon information theory, or the mathematical study of how physical systems can efficiently communicate information.  This model suggests that training and expertise fundamentally change a person's perceptual system in a way that leads to more efficient use of cognitive resources. In order to test this model, a series of behavioral experiments will be conducted involving novice and experienced students in the geosciences. These experiments and computational modeling efforts will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to improve geoscience and education."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will design and develop a new K-12 classroom observation protocol for integrated STEM instruction (STEM-OP). The STEM-OP will be developed for use in K-12 STEM settings. While the importance of integrated STEM education is established, there remains disagreement on models and effective approaches for integrated STEM instruction. This issue is confounded by the lack of observation protocols sensitive to integrated STEM teaching and learning to inform research to the effectiveness of new models and strategies. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments. The STEM-OP will be designed to be used effectively by multiple stakeholders in a variety of contexts. Researchers will benefit from having the STEM-OP available for them to carry out research and continue to improve STEM education in a variety of ways. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments.  The STEM-OP and associated training materials will be available for use by other education stakeholders, such as K-12 teachers and district administrators, through a publicly available online platform. In brief, the STEM-OP will inform the instruction of integrated STEM in many contexts with the goal of improving integrated STEM education.<br/><br/>The primary product of this project is the new observation protocol called STEM-OP for K-12 classrooms implementing integrated STEM lessons. The project will use over 500 integrated STEM classroom videos to design the STEM-OP. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the STEM-OP will be a valid and reliable instrument for use in a variety of educational contexts. The research will explore the different ways that elementary, middle, and high school science teachers enact integrated STEM instruction. This study will shed light on the nature of STEM instruction in each of these grade bands and provide information building towards an understanding of learning progressions for engineering practices across grade bands. Research exploring how the nature of STEM integration changes from day to day over the course of a unit will provide critical information about the different sequencing and trajectories of STEM units. Examining how integrated STEM instruction unfolds over a full unit of instruction will inform the understanding of integrated STEM practices at both micro- and macro- levels of analysis.

Recent evidence shows that learning math language (e.g., concepts such as more, few, less, near, before) during preschool supports this development. The purpose of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to examine the process by which math language instruction improves learning of mathematics skills in order to design and translate the most effective interventions into practical classroom instruction. The first objective of this project is to examine if quantitative and spatial math language effect the development of different aspects of mathematics performance (e.g., numeracy, geometry). The second objective is to examine how quantitative math language versus numeracy instruction, either alone or in combination, effect numeracy development. The findings from this study will not only be used to improve theoretical understanding of how math language and mathematics skills develop, but the instructional materials developed for this study will also result in practical tools for enhancing young children's math language and mathematics skills.  <br/><br/>This project is focused on evaluating the role of early math language skills in the acquisition of early mathematics skills. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) will be conducted. The first RCT will be used to evaluate the effects of different types of math language instruction (quantitative, spatial) on distinct aspects of mathematics (numeracy, geometry). It is expected that quantitative language instruction will improve numeracy skills and spatial language instruction will improve geometry skills. The second RCT will be used to examine the unique and joint effects of quantitative language instruction and numeracy instruction on children's numeracy skills. It is expected that both types of instruction alone will be sufficient to generate improvement on numeracy outcomes compared to an active control group, but that the combination of the two will result in enhanced numeracy performance compared to either alone. Educational goals will be integrated with and supported through engaging diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students in hands-on research experiences, training pre- and in-service teachers on mathematical language instruction, and building collaborative relationships with early career researchers. Intervention materials including storybooks developed for the project and pre- and in-service teacher training/lesson plan materials will be made available at the completion of the project.<br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

However, it is unclear exactly how early learning environments should be structured to support the development of children's math understanding. Lack of such knowledge is a critical problem because, without it, scientists cannot explain and predict children's understanding of foundational math concepts, and parents and educators are left to rely on their own, sometimes erroneous intuitions when choosing learning materials for their children. In the current project, researchers from the University of Notre Dame will study how the design of one type of early learning material - children's counting books - affects children's book reading behaviors and early math understanding. In this way, the project will further the mission of EHR Core Research (ECR) program to advance knowledge of children's math learning and the early learning environments that support it.  <br/><br/>The central hypothesis is that counting books with tactile features (e.g., pop ups, textured graphics) will be less effective than those without tactile features for supporting children's understanding of counting and associated math concepts. Books with tactile features are expected to elicit at least two behaviors that may hinder math learning: (a) attention focused on the individual objects rather than on the set as a whole and (b) off-task utterances and actions. The research team will work with a diverse sample of preschoolers from Head Start, Title-I preschools, and private early childhood programs. The research methods include a pretest-intervention-posttest randomized experiment in which children will read assigned books with a trained tutor in school over the course of several weeks, as well as a less structured experiment in which children will read assigned books with their primary caregiver in a more naturalistic shared book reading context. By combining these approaches, the researchers will not only be able to determine how different types of books affect pre-to-post changes in math understanding, but also be able to conduct detailed observations and analyses of the language and behaviors that emerge during shared book reading. The project will advance the science of early math learning by testing theory-driven hypotheses. Findings will inform best-practice guidelines for the design of counting books and, thus, will help parents and early childhood educators make more informed decisions when selecting learning materials for their homes and classrooms."

Providing role models through outreach is widely practiced and recommended, yet little is known about how elementary students, particularly girls, choose engineering role models. Engineering interest declines as girls enter middle school, making elementary school a potentially critical developmental window for bolstering engineering aspirations. The project will generate and share knowledge of female elementary students' selection of role models in a university-based engineering outreach program. Specifically, it will increase understanding of the ways in which girls identify and select engineering role models and it will contribute to understanding how role models promote interest in engineering careers by girls. This project will inform best practices in engineering outreach, and help university outreach leaders develop more effective educational interventions for female elementary students. Ultimately, this research aims to increase the number of girls and women studying engineering and working as engineers. Increasing the number of girls and women interested in engineering increases educational and economic equity for women and increases the pool of skilled engineers, thereby improving technology development in the nation. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The Role Models in Engineering Education project goals are to advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which female elementary students identify engineering role models and to develop resources to support effective role model-student interactions that can be used by any university-based engineering outreach program.

Over three years, the project will study 160 elementary students and 96 undergraduate engineering students in an established engineering outreach program, and will focus on positioning the undergraduates as emulable role models by making their engineering identities evident and by building supportive relationships between the undergraduates and the elementary students. The project will utilize in-depth qualitative analysis of the interactions between role models and students, complemented with quantitative tools to evaluate identity and career awareness. This research will inform an iterative process of designing resources and training to prepare role models in engineering and optimize their interactions with elementary students. This project aims to increase understanding of how girls take up engineering role models and to develop effective role model training. By adding to knowledge of engineering role model identification and uptake, this research may help outreach providers spark and sustain more girls' interest in engineering study and engineering careers."

Research shows that engaging children early on in these types of activities builds strong affiliations with the larger STEM community, creates a sense of belonging in that community, and helps prepare children to easily assimilate within the rapidly changing technological world. To ensure that the Making activities are not an end unto themselves, teachers will participate in ongoing professional development activities to learn how to integrate Making activities into the existing science curriculum for the longer term. This iteratively designed study stems from prior NSF support and is structured around four threads aimed at: (a) conceptualizing the Maker's movement in terms of early childhood development; (b) instilling a Maker's mindset in children; (c) influencing children's identity about STEM; and (d) benefiting society through contributions to the future STEM workforce. Research questions structured around these threads will guide the project team's work with 100 children in five cohorts over three years who will participate in the Maker's intervention to observe the effects on children's self-identity with STEM. The project team will use a mixed-methods design to allow comparisons across three grades each year. A control group of 100 children at the same grades will be used for comparison purposes. The expected outcome is that over time, children will begin to see themselves as active partakers of and contributors to STEM fields and what STEM careers might offer."

But attempts to train these abilities have not translated to substantial improvement in STEM talents. This may be because current training focuses on rote practice, assuming that it is possible to improve the capacity of someone's spatial imagination.

These spatial training programs may be ineffective because they are based on an impoverished model of the cognitive and visuospatial capacities processes underlying spatial thinking, both generally and in discipline-based education research. The present research will unpack spatial ability into three hypothesized mechanisms, to isolate where training might be best focused, using a set of controlled laboratory tasks that ask novices (undergraduates) and experts to encode and transform both unfamiliar/abstract and molecular stimuli. With chemistry as a case study, this project will unravel the relative contribution of three potential mechanisms for visuospatial representation and transformation: domain-specific chunking (using long-term memory representations of frequently-encountered chunks), domain-general compression skills (recognizing and leveraging redundancies such as repeated identities or planes of symmetry), and raw visuospatial capacity (the ability to store and transform any abstract set of points or shapes).

Students and scientists who are talented in STEM fields also tend to a high capacity for spatial imagination -- they score highly on tasks that ask them to imagine rotations of shapes, or predict how shapes will look when they are folded. But attempts to train these abilities have not translated to substantial improvement in STEM talents. This may be because current training focuses on rote practice, assuming that it is possible to improve the capacity of someone's spatial imagination. In contrast, this may be not possible -- even STEM experts may not have a substantially higher raw capacity for spatial imagination, compared to the average person. The research will test the exciting possibility that their available imagination 'machinery' is similar, but that experts have learned a set of strategies for using that same capacity far more efficiently.

This two-year research and development process will be modeled on Clements's (2007) Curriculum Research Framework and will: 1) explore foundational research in early childhood math and CT, consult with expert advisors, and conduct stakeholder interviews with teachers working in under-served urban and rural preschool settings to understand the learning opportunities that could arise when CT is infused into existing preschool mathematical practice; 2) draft preschool CT learning models that will inform development of CT activity prototypes and a playful set of CT learning tasks to explore preschoolers' CT learning; 3) conduct a formative research process to explore children's CT learning and teachers' CT understanding as they engage with prototype hands-on activities and digital tablet apps aligned with concepts taught in the NSF-funded Building Blocks preschool math curriculum, and; 4) evaluate preschool children's learning using the Research-Based Early Math Assessment to understand how their performance on the CT learning tasks corresponds to their learning of mathematics.

The model will center around a series of design challenges that engage middle school students in solving personally and socially significant real world problems using low and high-tech tools that are available in Maker spaces. While game design has been recognized as a potentially powerful means of STEM learning, it has been most commonly used to introduce children to programming. We have yet to explore the potential of making games as a means of enhancing design thinking and inspiring other forms of Making. Making games is not a common activity in Maker spaces, yet game making is an activity that appeals to a wide range of young people. Game design may be a way to attract youth who might find more typical Maker space activities to be intimidating or unappealing. This project will lay the foundation for further inquiry into the pathways that young people from underrepresented backgrounds might take from game design into other forms of Making and STEM learning.<br/><br/>The project leadership will collaborate with six mentors (3 teachers and 3 librarians) to iteratively design, test, and refine design challenges in a formal and informal learning environment. Students will engage in the design thinking process that emphasizes the role of empathy and understanding human needs as central to effective design. They will be introduced to a variety of tools ranging from paper-based and cardboard construction to e-textiles, programming, and robotics as they participate in design cycles of empathizing, defining, prototyping, and testing. Parents will be invited to participate in different stages of the design process as informants, co-designers, and user testers to support students' learning and Making process. The pedagogical strategies that will be developed as part of the project for students will inform ways to design and organize activities in the Maker context to create more inclusive learning experiences for students. Furthermore, the project will explore what support mechanisms mentors need in regard to Making and design thinking to effectively facilitate students' learning and Making. The results from this project will illuminate participation structures that are important to build a Maker community where students, educators, and parents work together as learning partners in schools and libraries.

The team will examine abilities assumed by prevailing theories to be universal by studying mathematical learning in the Tsimane', a unique population of farming-foragers. The extreme variability in their exposure to formal education will provide the researchers with an opportunity to evaluate the roles of education, age, maturity, and core cognitive systems in driving early mathematical development. The project will involve multiple methodologies from ethnographic studies of number use in Tsimane' life, to assessments of basic cognitive resources such as working memory, to tests of mathematical knowledge. The team will conduct studies of matched samples of children from 2 to 12 years of age in the US who grow up in impoverished learning environments. The goal is to identify which cognitive components of number competence ought to be targeted by future interventions so as to improve learning in US children living in poverty or who face learning delays. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>Many abilities are related to numeracy and number sense, including knowledge of sets, the number words, counting, 1-1 correspondence, spatial relations, and approximate number estimation. Yet, it is not known which of these capacities are the foundations of early number growth and which are the consequence of number acquisition or other cultural factors. This proposal will seek to discover the cognitive underpinnings of number in an indigenous population, the Tsimane'. The key scientifically-relevant features of this population are the extreme variability in their formal educational system -- some children receive no formal education -- and that they progress through the stages of number learning at a protracted timescale, taking 3-4 times as long other children in the locale and children in the United States. Other children have longer, formal education.  The high variability in education, age, and parental numeracy in this population will allow many of the components related to number growth to be disentangled as causal factors to an unusual extent. The team will use anthropological methods to document the cultural context and use of number in order to understand what practices support its acquisition and predict children's knowledge. They will also use a series of simple experimental tasks drawn from the mathematics education and cognitive science literatures to assess numerical development and chart the trajectory of Tsimane' number learning in detail. The goal is to develop a unifying computational model of number learning that can be used rapidly to predict which future interventions will be most promising in helping to improve learning in US children, especially those living in disadvantaged learning environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Workers in manufacturing increasingly need to have skills involving the use of computational thinking, software and advanced technologies. The project will develop a series of Digital Invention Kits that will enable high school students to reconstruct working models of the digital counterparts of these inventions. For example, the Davenport Rotary Motor, patented in 1837, will be used as scaffolding for development of a Stepper Motor Kit that incorporates a digital micro-controller. Students will thereby learn about the way in which the original analog electromechanical mechanisms led to development of today's digital counterparts.  The proposed Digital Invention Kits will (1) provide an introduction to computational thinking, (2) recruit diverse students who are not traditionally attracted to STEM fields, and (3) introduce these students to industrial automation. The associated infrastructure developed through these projects will increase the capacity of schools to offer a broader range of manufacturing technologies in K-12 makerspaces. Participation in these programs by a broader range of students will also lead to increased diversity in advanced manufacturing programs in community colleges and beyond. The completed Digital Invention Kits and accompanying pedagogical materials, assessment items, and teacher support materials will be made available on the Make to Learn website and disseminated by professional organizations. The project will also conduct workshops and short courses introducing these materials to technology and engineering educators.<br/><br/>The project will investigate: (1) how effective the Digital Invention Kits in improving computational thinking, (2) how effective the Kits are in engaging and retaining female and underrepresented students for the entire Kit sequence, and (3) how the computational thinking strategies introduced in the program affect student design and product development. The project will use a mixed method approach to assess participant growth in various aspects of computational thinking, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. To examine student thought processes and solutions, the project will use qualitative approaches to study computational strategies, actions, coding and products, along with rationales and related beliefs.

The basic concepts and skills of arithmetic and geometry that children learn in elementary school are critical for all subsequent learning and practicing of mathematics and science, but their acquisition, in relation to younger children's preexisting numerical and geometrical concepts, is not well understood. The proposed experiments are guided by the hypothesis that children learn school mathematics by using symbols- both language and visual-spatial symbols such as pictures and maps- to combine productively the early-developing numerical and spatial representations that emerge in infancy. To test this hypothesis, the proposed experiments probe the relationship between children's performance on tests of core numerical and geometrical abilities and their performance on tests of symbolic arithmetic, map reading, and abstract geometrical reasoning. Some experiments use individual difference methods to test whether variability in children's sensitivity to core numerical or geometric information is associated with variability in the mastery of language or symbols or of more abstract mathematical concepts. Further experiments use training methods to investigate whether tasks that exercise children's core abilities or use of symbols enhance children's numerical or geometrical reasoning in tests of school mathematics. The training experiments probe both the existence of relationships between core and constructed mathematical abilities and the underlying cognitive and motivational processes that may account for these relationships. Through these investigations, the experiments aim both to contribute to basic understanding of mathematical cognition and to inform efforts to enhance children's mathematical learning and reasoning.<br/><br/>The proposed research has two complementary goals. First, it aims to shed light on the fundamental cognitive capacities that allow humans to develop knowledge of elementary school mathematics, especially the abstract concepts and rules of arithmetic and Euclidean geometry. Second, the research aims to develop better ways to aid children's learning of mathematics, by building on basic research findings concerning the nature and early development of reasoning in the core cognitive domains on which elementary school mathematics may be founded. To accomplish these goals, tasks that previously were developed as tools to probe the fundamental numerical and geometrical abilities of infants, children, and adults in diverse cultures are deployed both to assess patterns of variability in children's mathematical abilities and to serve as training interventions with the potential to enhance school math abilities. The experiments investigate not only the direct relations between early and later developing numerical and geometrical concepts, but also the ways in which children's developing mastery of symbols, cognitive control, and attitudes toward learning may modulate those relations and impact on children's learning and performance of school mathematics. Through these laboratory experiments, the research aims to achieve a better understanding of mature mathematical reasoning and to discover new ways to aid children's mastery of this critical domain of knowledge.<br/><br/>By investigating the sources of variability in children's mathematical reasoning and the experiences that enhance children's reasoning, the proposed research promises to contribute to efforts both to foster all children's learning of mathematics and to aid children who experience difficulty with learning in this domain. Because children's learning of mathematics is affected by motivational patterns as well as cognitive abilities, the experimental interventions aim to enhance not only the cognitive processes underlying mathematical reasoning but also children's attitudes towards mathematics, belief in the malleability of mathematical skills with practice, and sense of their own competence as mathematical learners. Because children often learn best in social contexts, the interventions aim to create a set of training materials that children can use to play with others, and experiments will compare these interventions to those instantiated in individualized interactive computer-training programs. The findings of this research should inform efforts to enhance children's learning of mathematics both in and outside of school, for 4- to 10-year-old children at all ability levels."

Providing role models through outreach is widely practiced and recommended, yet little is known about how elementary students, particularly girls, choose engineering role models. Engineering interest declines as girls enter middle school, making elementary school a potentially critical developmental window for bolstering engineering aspirations. The project will generate and share knowledge of female elementary students' selection of role models in a university-based engineering outreach program. Specifically, it will increase understanding of the ways in which girls identify and select engineering role models and it will contribute to understanding how role models promote interest in engineering careers by girls. This project will inform best practices in engineering outreach, and help university outreach leaders develop more effective educational interventions for female elementary students. Ultimately, this research aims to increase the number of girls and women studying engineering and working as engineers. Increasing the number of girls and women interested in engineering increases educational and economic equity for women and increases the pool of skilled engineers, thereby improving technology development in the nation. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The Role Models in Engineering Education project goals are to advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which female elementary students identify engineering role models and to develop resources to support effective role model-student interactions that can be used by any university-based engineering outreach program. The intervention model draws on the stereotype inoculation model, role model theory, and design-based research practices. Over three years, the project will study 160 elementary students and 96 undergraduate engineering students in an established engineering outreach program, and will focus on positioning the undergraduates as emulable role models by making their engineering identities evident and by building supportive relationships between the undergraduates and the elementary students. The project will utilize in-depth qualitative analysis of the interactions between role models and students, complemented with quantitative tools to evaluate identity and career awareness. This research will inform an iterative process of designing resources and training to prepare role models in engineering and optimize their interactions with elementary students. This project aims to increase understanding of how girls take up engineering role models and to develop effective role model training. By adding to knowledge of engineering role model identification and uptake, this research may help outreach providers spark and sustain more girls' interest in engineering study and engineering careers."

As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM teaching and learning and broadening participation of students in computing and computing-intensive fields. This project builds upon a successful prior afterschool program for teaching computational thinking (TECHFIT), expanding it to include two additional new learning contexts: an elective class; as embedded modules within discipline-based middle school courses; together with the existing afterschool program. A total of 165 teachers (including 144 new teachers) and 2850 middle school students (grades 6-8) at schools with large underserved and/or minority populations will be involved in the project.  The project has two core objectives: 1) to develop and validate a computational thinking assessment tool; and, 2) to examine the development of computational thinking and motivation in middle school students across the three contexts (afterschool, in-school class, embedded modules). The learning activity for students involves engaging in a game-based activity for physical fitness by using the programming language Scratch, flowchart programming, and via a microcontroller with electronic parts. <br/><br/>The research employs a pretest-posttest multi-site, randomized controlled trial design to determine the impact of three learning contexts (after-school program, in-school course, and instructional modules) on students' pre-/post computational thinking skills, motivation, self-efficacy for computing, and interest in and aspiration for computing careers. New instruments will be developed and validated to evaluate the extent to which students learn computational thinking skills. The research will examine the relationships among motivational factors and computational thinking in the three learning contexts to determine if context influences teacher delivery and student experiences, and ultimately the development of computational thinking."

The arguments and proofs of this geometry require one to imagine points so small they have no dimension and lines that extend so far they never end. And yet the points and lines experienced in everyday life have dimension and are finite. Where do the uniquely human ideas of abstract points and lines come from? To what extent does human reasoning work with idealizations and abstractions and to what extent does it remain rooted in everyday, physical finitudes? This project will address such questions by exploring three interrelated cognitive aspects of human geometric aptitude: 1) the role of mental simulation and rule-based reasoning in children's and adults' basic judgments about triangles; 2) the conditions that allow infants, children, and adults to identify lines as the shortest distance between two points; and 3) the effects of couching geometry in a physical context (e.g., gravity) on children's and adults' judgments about the fastest path between two locations in space. This proposal will characterize how early emerging perceptual sensitivities to the properties of the scenes and objects of everyday life might form the foundation of human understanding of the imperceptible. This understanding lies at the heart of much human achievement and also constitutes one of the main aims of school learning. The promise of this project is that in uncovering the basic and universal spatial intuitions humans rely on when confronted with difficult and novel geometry problems, the field will better be able to develop pedagogies that build on the strengths and supplement the limitations of these intuitions. The project is supported by a CAREER award to New York University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>In three series of experiments, the project will both conduct research in active educational settings and lay the foundation for future educational interventions that harness our basic and universal spatial intuitions. Series 1 will characterize how people reason intuitively about the properties of triangles. Are their properties evaluated through mental simulation and imagery or through abstract rules? Series 2 will explore how people think about lines. Under what conditions are lines recognized as the shortest path between two points? How does that recognition relate to everyday experiences, like navigating from one place to another, through development? Series 3 will probe geometric intuitions about efficient paths in physical contexts with gravity. The experiments will take place in the laboratory and in the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath). MoMath will also be a site for general dissemination of the project's findings, including a talk series that will bring together cognitive scientists, educators, and the public. This project will thus reach thousands of individuals through basic science research and through outreach at the museum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using best practices for literature search, effects from approximately 500 studies across education, psychology, and other disciplines will be coded for effects on declarative knowledge, inference, procedural skills, and transfer to uninstructed content. A meta-regression approach will be used to examine main effects, interactions with individual difference variables, and both theory-driven and demographic moderators.

Workers in manufacturing increasingly need to have skills involving the use of computational thinking, software and advanced technologies. The project will develop a series of Digital Invention Kits that will enable high school students to reconstruct working models of the digital counterparts of these inventions. For example, the Davenport Rotary Motor, patented in 1837, will be used as scaffolding for development of a Stepper Motor Kit that incorporates a digital micro-controller. Students will thereby learn about the way in which the original analog electromechanical mechanisms led to development of today's digital counterparts.  The proposed Digital Invention Kits will (1) provide an introduction to computational thinking, (2) recruit diverse students who are not traditionally attracted to STEM fields, and (3) introduce these students to industrial automation. The associated infrastructure developed through these projects will increase the capacity of schools to offer a broader range of manufacturing technologies in K-12 makerspaces. Participation in these programs by a broader range of students will also lead to increased diversity in advanced manufacturing programs in community colleges and beyond. The completed Digital Invention Kits and accompanying pedagogical materials, assessment items, and teacher support materials will be made available on the Make to Learn website and disseminated by professional organizations.

There are claims that use of such toys can enhance problem solving skills, develop early computational thinking, and provide a context for putting mathematics understandings to work. This has yielded a number of commercial products that purportedly help children to realize those benefits. While many of these early childhood coding toys are fun and playful, research on their ability to truly support early computer science learning is needed. For such work to be possible, educators need assessments that measure integrated computational thinking for early childhood learners that can quantify learning that takes place with coding toys. However, such assessments do not yet exist. This is compounded by a lack of curricular units and learning modules for early childhood classrooms that integrate computation and mathematics and build upon what these toys are supposed to offer. The project is funded by the STEM+C Program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school. <br/><br/>In this STEM+C project, mathematics and computational thinking will be integrated in early childhood education. Using Evidence-Centered Design, the project will develop a theoretically-based, empirically-tested assessment to measure kindergarten children's abilities to reason computationally with mathematical problem solving skills (i.e., strategies and ways of thinking that aid their understanding and use of mathematical knowledge) in teachers' classrooms. The project will also develop modules for kindergarten instruction that encourage integrated computational thinking with mathematical problem solving. Recognizing that these are circular constraints, the project will involve the following four sequential steps: (1) operationalize early CT in kindergarten mathematics classrooms by identifying CT competencies; (2) develop curriculum involving a subset of current early childhood toys around the competencies; (3) develop an assessment to measure students' CT and mathematics competencies; and (4) conduct evaluation studies of the curriculum and assessment in kindergarten classrooms. Project deliverables include: a competency model of integrated computational thinking; an assessment that measures the competency model; and curriculum resources for teachers around the competency model that leverages toys and technologies intended for early childhood settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Education Development Center's exploratory project, Think Math+C: Integrating Programming into a Comprehensive K-5 Mathematics Curriculum, will investigate how integrating programming into a comprehensive elementary mathematics curriculum can support students' mathematical understanding and computational thinking. Programming is a computational language through which students can express their mathematical ideas and computational thinking precisely. Where mathematical notation on paper just sits there, programming is active and students can engage in it and judge the correctness of a problem by processing it. This can potentially be transformative in a mathematics classroom, making mental acts, such as decomposing problems, hiding irrelevant detail, and generalizing from specific instances visible to students and their teachers in ways that other media do not accomplish as well, and allowing students to examine and debug their own thinking. The three-year project will build a coherent progression of programming ideas and skills naturally into a mathematics curriculum across the elementary grades, allowing computational thinking and mathematical reasoning to grow in developmentally appropriate ways that complement each other. High-quality instructional materials developed in this project will support teachers and students in programming activities that can strengthen both mathematical and computational thinking, giving a much wider range of students a greater opportunity learning and academic advancement. <br/><br/>The Think Math+C three-year project will work closely with elementary teachers and students to develop a scope and sequence for a K-5 mathematics curriculum that fully integrates programming, and to design and implement instructional activities with grade 2 teachers and students. To build this fully integrated elementary mathematics and programming curriculum, the project team will use as a base, Think Math, an existing comprehensive and coherent K-5 mathematics curriculum developed at the Education Development Center with prior support from NSF. The project team will also examine the impact of those activities on instruction and student thinking, comparing Think Math+C to business-as-usual Think Math classrooms using classroom observations and cognitive interviews. The project will also pilot and refine measures that capture evidence of students' mathematical and computational thinking, which will advance the field with new evidence for the effects of integrated STEM + computing teaching and learning."

It is aimed at developing, refining, testing, and validating a prototype to illustrate the synergy among formative assessment (FA), computational thinking (CT), and self-regulated learning (SRL) within the discipline of computer science (CS) with teachers (n=10) and students (n=160) in 9th-12th grades. The project will focus on FA, also known as assessment for learning, which generates information that is used for feedback to modify teaching and learning activities. By explicitly eliciting student SRL learning during problem-solving, assessment tasks will illustrate the synergy between FA and SRL. Students will be prompted to analyze a CT task before attempting to solve it, explicitly setting goals, and reflecting on teacher feedback to direct their behaviors towards achieving these goals in subsequent attempts. To elicit SRL behavior, CT task design will follow a three-phase model. Phase 1 will focus on goal setting and task analysis. Phase 2 will focus on self-monitoring during task performance, while Phase 3 will center on reflection. Each task will have two performance iterations, allowing students and teachers to put feedback about prior performance into use. Tasks' content will be drawn from the CS curricula used in secondary school classrooms. They will be validated in authentic classroom contexts in a public school system with a diverse student population. This effort plans to achieve the following outcomes: (1) creation of four prototype CT assessment tasks; (2) development of reliability and validity arguments for the tasks; (3) research into impacts on student CT performance of process-oriented teacher feedback and explicit use of SRL; and (4) development of teacher expertise in FA of CT. <br/><br/>The project will address two key research questions: (1) Does teacher feedback positively affect student performance when it provides goal-specific feedback on SRL processes, as well as performance outcomes?; and (2) Do students who engage in SRL cycles improve performance on CT tasks, as compared to students who complete tasks without explicit prompts to engage in SRL? To answer these questions, the project will conduct two research studies. The first study will investigate the extent to which teacher feedback on both SRL processes and task performance positively affects student CT achievement, more than outcome-based feedback only. This study will use a quasi-experimental, pre- post-test design with comparison group. Students in the treatment condition will receive feedback on SRL processes and CT task performance. Students in the control condition will receive feedback on performance outcomes only. The second study will investigate the extent to which students who engage in SRL through explicit prompting improve performance on CT tasks, as compared to students without SRL prompts. This study will employ an experimental mixed-model design to examine differences between experimental groups and changes in students' performance over three repeated measurement cycles. The main outcome of this effort will be a prototype illustrating the potential synergies among CT, FA, and SRL which will be used in the future to further research on the intersections among these domains. The tasks developed under this project will be made available online at no cost to the public through multiple practitioner networks. An advisory board and external evaluator will provide feedback and recommendations in regard to the progress and quality of the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teachers' implementation of flipped instruction has increased dramatically in recent years, with more than two-thirds of teachers now reporting flipping a lesson, if not an entire course. Although popular media and philanthropic organizations have given a great deal of attention and financial support to flipped instruction, little is known about how teachers implement it and what benefits and drawbacks flipped instruction has in contrast with non-flipped instruction. This study can provide a basis for design research focused on developing effective materials and programs for flipped instruction in secondary mathematics. This design and development is already occurring at an increasing rate, but it is not yet informed by empirical evidence. This project will result in a framework for flipped instruction robust enough to be useful at a variety of grade levels and contexts. The framework will provide a better understanding of the relationships among various implementations of flipped instruction and student learning. These findings can inform teacher educators in better aligning their instruction to instructional formats that correlate with increased student learning outcomes. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of STEM innovations and approaches.

Working in 40 algebra classrooms -- 20 implementing some form of flipped instruction and 20 serving as a non-flipped basis for comparison -- the project will address the following research questions using a correlational design and multilevel modeling techniques: RQ1. What are salient factors entailed in flipped instruction in secondary algebra? RQ2. What associations, if any, exist among factors entailed in teachers' implementation of flipped algebra instruction and students' learning of algebra as measured on a state-mandated end-of-course assessment and on a concept-of-variable inventory?"

This project will expand upon an existing program to provide students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields with dynamic career and technical training experiences through partnerships with advanced manufacturing companies and community colleges in the local region.  The project extends research on work-based learning by examining a model that includes six important components:  career awareness, soft skills development, mentoring, employer engagement, provision of industry recognized credentials, and college credit. The project weaves together paid internships, culturally-responsive mentoring, career awareness, college credit, soft skills development, and industry-recognized certifications into one career pathway program for urban and rural high school students.  The program focuses on girls and minority participants, and in grades 11 and 12, participants devote 10 hours per week to a paid internship at a local manufacturing company.  Participants can also earn up to 12 college credits while completing the program.<br/><br/>This project will build on a career-awareness program model that begins with all students in grade 9 at five schools attending awareness-building seminars, watching online videos, hearing guest speakers, and taking factory tours to gain broad awareness of possible STEM career pathwayss in manufacturing.  At grade 10, through a combination of self-selection, teacher nominations, and parent involvement, up to 12 students per school join the project cohort and begin learning job-related skills, training on equipment, and earning college credit at their local community college.  This project extends the existing model by engaging 240 urban and rural high school juniors and seniors from the five schools in the pilot of an on-the-job STEM skill development program with direct linkages to the manufacturing sector.

Identifying with engineering is critical to help students pursue engineering careers. This project responds to this persistent large-scale problem. The I-Engineering framework and tools address both the learning problem (supporting students in learning engineering design) and the identity problem (supporting students in recognizing that they belong in engineering). I-Engineering will support identity development as a part of learning two core practices in engineering: 1) defining problems and 2) designing solutions. In particular, the I-Engineering framework and tools will help middle grades teachers and students engage in the engineering design process using meaningful, authentic and often youth-driven contexts. The project will ground this work in two engineering design challenges: 1) safe and green commutes and 2) portable energy, both of which exemplify engineering for sustainable communities. The objectives are to: 1) To develop research-based understandings of how to support identity development among middle school students from underrepresented backgrounds in the context of learning engineering. 2) To develop and refine a framework and tools (I-Engineering) in support of student learning and identity development in engineering with a focus on sustainability.  3) To collaborate with grades 6 and 7 teachers to implement and refine I-Engineering for classroom use. 4) To study whether the I-Engineering framework/tools support identity development in engineering among middle school students from underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>The project draws upon design-based implementation research to develop and test the I-Engineering framework and tools among students and teachers in grades 6 and 7.

The research questions are grounded in two areas: supporting identity development in engineering, understanding how students progress in their engineering development and patterns across implementation of the I-Engineering resources. Studies will shed light on mechanisms that support identity development in engineering, how that might be scaffolded, and how such scaffolds can transport across context. The mixed-method student- and classroom-level studies will allow for empirical claims regarding how and under what conditions youth from underrepresented backgrounds may progress in their identity development in engineering. The research plan includes student case studies drawing on task-based interviews, observations and student work and classroom studies using observations, student and teacher interviews, an engineering identity survey, student work and formative assessments of engineering practices. I-Engineering will reach over 500 students and their teachers in schools that serve predominantly underrepresented populations. The project team will disseminate the findings, framework and tools in support of teaching engineering practices, and promoting understanding of the importance of identity development in broadening participation."

(A digital badge, like a badge earned in a scout troop, is a validated indicator of accomplishment or skill that is housed and managed online and can be earned in informal or formal environments.) The process will give underserved youth a technology-supported method for presenting their Information Communication Technology (ICT) achievements in an out-of-school program in ways that are personally meaningful and that address the expectations of higher education institutions. Digital badge systems have the potential to become alternative credentialing methods. Beginning in the fall of each school year, high school participants meet weekly for several hours in an afterschool program that teaches them human-centered design principles and practices. The youth identify two or three social problems they would like to take on in a design project. Over the following months, they learn to interview end users who will benefit from the technology, and to brainstorm and prototype technological solutions. They use CAD software, 3D printers, microprocessors, simple motors, building materials, hand tools, and other design technologies to create, and in some cases code, their prototypes. Students also integrate user, peer, and expert feedback into their prototypes. The project partners (Educational Development Center, Mouse, DreamYard Project, and Parsons School of Design) will redesign the existing Design League badge system, with input from current and former Design League youth participants, and formalize a procedure for Parsons administrators (and eventually other higher education institutions) to endorse badges as admissions credentials in its undergraduate programs. <br/><br/>The project will investigate whether a group of 11th-grade high school students who engage in at least some of the activities for building a digital badge portfolio will be more likely than a comparison group of students who do not to express interest in ICT as a career or academic opportunity, to persist in ICT-related higher education and employment pursuits, and to envision themselves in those careers in the near future. The project will implement design and research in three phases:  (1) Program Expansion, Iterative Development, Formative Testing, and Documentation; (2) Feasibility Testing of the research instruments and analysis methods adequately; and (3) Pilot Testing of whether and how the creation of Design League badge portfolios shows promise of supporting underrepresented youth to persist in STEM and ICT pursuits.  Project research will contribute knowledge to research and development communities about alternative credentialing methods, particularly for underserved youth. The research findings will help determine whether digital badge portfolio systems that bridge out-of-school learning activities and the college admissions process show evidence of promise as tools to increase underrepresented youth persistence in STEM activities, at a time when digital badge and other alternative credentialing systems are proliferating. Documentation of the collaboration processes among project partners will enable future partnerships between informal learning organizations and higher education institutions to create badge systems that can used to assign meaningful credentials to personally meaningful experiences into college and career pathways.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program that supports projects that build understandings of best practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to engaging students in learning and developing interest in STEM, information and communications technology (ICT), computer science, and related STEM content and careers."

The focus will be on mathematics problem-solving strategies used by adolescents, and how these strategies are adopted and changed as problems become systematically more difficult. The project will examine the association of these strategies with mathematics-related cognitive skills, scores on tests of mathematics achievement, and patterns of brain activations displayed by adolescents while engaged in these strategies. Problem-solving strategies are of interest because of their relation to higher-level mathematic achievement and the insights they can offer into the basis of individual differences in mathematics learning. The longer-term objective of the project is to discover new ways to tailor mathematical learning strategies to individual cognitive and neural capacities. The project will also undertake innovative methods of collecting information about neural functioning during math tasks with the potential to influence future studies of the brain systems involved in learning and behavior. The project is funded by the EHR (Education and Human Resources directorate) Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the literature on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) learning. <br/><br/>Participants will be adolescents, 14-16 years of age, who were previously enrolled in a longitudinal study of the consequences of preterm versus term birth on academic progress across the first 3 years in school. Measures will include tests of spatial skills, attention, executive functions such as working memory, number sense, and mathematics achievement; sets of mental arithmetic and fractions problems of varying difficulty designed to reveal individual differences in problem-solving strategies; and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) procedures to examine the neural correlates of these strategies. Following piloting with a separate sample of young adults, cognitive and achievement tests and assessments of problem-solving strategies will be administered to 100 adolescents, 50 of whom will be selected on the basis of their problem-solving strategies to complete in-magnet problem-solving tasks. Adolescents with more advanced problem-solving strategies (characterized by reliance on retrieval of solutions) are hypothesized to display more intact cognitive profiles and higher levels of mathematics achievement than those using less advanced approaches (characterized by more effortful multi-step procedures). Adolescents using more advanced strategies are also hypothesized to show patterns of brain activation in regions specialized for efficient mathematics processing, such as the hippocampus and posterior parietal region, as compared to regions that are less specialized such as the prefrontal area. These participants are also expected to display less pronounced changes in activation patterns with increased problem difficulty, suggestive of greater neural efficiency in mathematics problem-solving and less reliance on compensatory systems. The project will include novel statistical methods for cognitive modeling and an exciting new approach to assess brain functioning during math problem solving. This research will provide insight into the cognitive skills and neural processes associated with successful strategy adoption for problem solving, with an emphasis on neural capacity, efficiency, and compensation."

Building on their prior work with an elementary version, the efficacy study focuses on the implementation of the principals underlying the materials, fidelity of use of the materials, and impact on students' learning.<br/>The project's goals are to: 1) develop an MPP book and companion materials dedicated to algebra readiness content and skills, 2) investigate how MPP transforms pedagogical practices to improve students' algebra readiness and metacognitive skills, and 3) validate MPP's effectiveness for improving students' algebra readiness with a large-scale randomized controlled trial.<br/><br/>The iterative design and efficacy studies produce research-based materials to increase student learning of core concepts in algebra readiness. Though the focus of the project is algebra readiness, the study also examines the validity of the pedagogical approach of MPP. The MPP lesson structures are designed to help students confront common misconceptions, dubbed ""pitfalls,"" through sense-making, class discussions, and the use of multiple visual representations. If the pedagogical approach of MPP proves to be successful, the lesson structures can be presented as an effective framework for instruction that extends to other content areas in mathematics and other disciplines.<br/><br/>The project addresses a critical need in education, and the potential impact is large. Math achievement in the U.S. is not keeping pace with international performance. The current project focuses on algebra readiness skills, an area that is critical for future success in mathematics. Algebra often serves as a gatekeeper to more advanced mathematics, and performance in algebra has been linked to success in college and long-term earnings potential. Longitudinal studies indicate that students taking rigorous high school mathematics courses are twice as likely to graduate from college as those who do not. Thus, adequately preparing students for algebra can dramatically affect educational outcomes for students. The current project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups of students in math and later science classes that require strong math skills. The intervention builds on materials and pedagogical techniques that have demonstrated positive outcomes for diverse students. The targeted districts have large samples of English language learners and students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM so that we may evaluate the impact of the intervention on these populations. At the end of the project, the publication quality materials will be readily available to teachers and districts through our website www.wested.org/mpp."

To benefit instruction and student learning, teachers need to be able to access and flexibly use their knowledge in the classroom in actual teaching situations and teaching tasks. Yet, measures to assess teachers' usable knowledge have remained scarce. We still know little about how the knowledge teachers acquire as part of teacher preparation courses and professional development becomes usable, how it develops over time, and how teachers use it in the process of teaching. To address both assessment needs in this project, The project will develop a set of scalable, classroom-focused measures of usable mathematics teaching knowledge that are aligned with state standards. The new measures will extend the classroom video analysis approach, which is based on teachers' ability to analyze and respond to teaching episodes shown in short video clips of authentic classroom instruction, by aligning video clips and assessment tasks to standards. The new measures, which will be made available online, will be a valuable tool for researchers, policy makers, and school districts to monitor teacher knowledge over time and to gauge teacher preparedness for implementing state standards in mathematics. The measures will also provide new insights into usable knowledge and knowledge use and advance a much-needed theory of teacher knowledge. Finally, the project extends and refines a promising assessment methodology that can be adapted to any future content frameworks or standards and that can also be used for instrument development in other practice-based knowledge domains. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is also supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The project will develop a scalable, classroom-focused measure of usable mathematics teaching knowledge that is aligned with the state standards through a classroom video analysis measure (CVA-M)) in three content areas: (a) fractions for grades 4 and 5, (b) ratio and proportions for grades 6 and 7; and (c) variables, expressions, and equations for grades 6 and 7. The project will examine the psychometric properties of the new items and scales, including the reliability of scores, and collect evidence on content, substantive, structural, and external aspects of validity to evaluate the overall construct validity of the CVA-M. The project builds on an innovative and promising assessment methodology that uses video clips of authentic classroom instruction that teachers are asked to view and analyze to elicit their usable knowledge. Teachers analyze the teaching episodes shown in the video clips from different assessment tasks that reflect authentic teaching tasks, such as diagnosing student thinking, generating mathematically targeted teacher question, or relating specific content and mathematical practices to teaching episodes shown in the clips. To develop each of the three scales, video clips will be mapped to state level content and mathematical practice standards. Assessment tasks and rubrics will also be aligned with these standards.  To create items, video clips will be combined with analysis prompts that ask for a written answer, multiple-choice or rating scales. To make the constructed response items, which need to be scored by trained raters, easier to use at scale, computational approaches will be employed to develop classifiers to automate scoring. Using responses from large samples of teachers, the psychometric properties of the new CVA-M items and scales will be analyzed using factor analysis, classical test theory and item response theory. A series of validity investigations will be conducted. Teachers' scores on the new CVA-M scales will be compared to their scores on another measure of teacher knowledge, the Mathematics Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) instrument, and each scale's predictive validity will be explored vis-a-vis student learning by relating teachers' CVA-M scores to their students' learning as measured by a pre-post quiz and by students' standardized test scores."

The community engagement strategy and materials created will be designed to lead to three learning outcomes: increased interest and engagement with genomics, change in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) attitudes and self-identity, and increased understanding about gene function and the human genome.  The model created in this project will have the potential to inform other educational efforts, nationally.<br/><br/>Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted in Spanish with 60 MCA Latinos to delineate beliefs and knowledge about genetic and genomic concepts and transmission of traits. Interview transcripts will be systematically analyzed to identify explanations about trait transmission, and familiarity with genetic and genomic concepts. Variation in responses across geographic and cultural regions will be noted. Knowledge from this analysis will be used to develop a meaningful community-based learning program about genomics. Lay community educators will facilitate informal learning with MCA adults about genetics and genomics, including gene-environment interactions. This project will use information about environmental exposures (e.g., residential pesticides) as a vehicle to pique participants' interest and illustrate genetic and genomic content. It will compare outcomes for 100 participants who receive practical strategies only to reduce negative and increase positive environmental exposures, respectively, to 100 participants who also receive genetic and genomic content.  The strategy and materials will be disseminated through journal articles and presentations at meetings that focus on informal STEM education. The process and content will be rigorously evaluated throughout the project.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The project will establish a dedicated public library-based Makerspace in a rural, relatively isolated and underserved community with close connections to an anchor space at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln that supports open-ended, self-directed learning, idea exploration, technical skills, entrepreneurship, and collaborative projects.  The project design will bring together experts from a wide variety of fields (e.g., engineering, textiles, photography, robotics, and STEM education) to provide youth with hands-on opportunities in six focus areas, electronics, textiles including e-textiles with wearable electronics, computers, digital media creation, music technology, and digital fabrication.  Youth will select a project and learning pathway based on their interests. Youth will then complete mini-courses and receive certification on the equipment and skills relevant to their chosen project. The expected synergy between virtual collaborative spaces and robotic telepresence will provide opportunities for teams of youth and mentors to collaborate regardless of geographic location and to creatively collaborate, problem solve and innovate. (Telepresence robots are defined as platforms that allow users to perceive that they are operating in another, typically remote physical space via technology.)  <br/><br/>This project focuses on using two main strategies; a) virtual collaborative spaces and b) robotic telepresence, to provide rural youth access to the Maker movement. This model will provide a replicable strategy of reaching rural underserved youth audiences within their communities so that they may establish wider learning communities with experts and mentors and thereby fully participate in the maker experience.  The use of telepresence robotics for focused one-on-one collaboration and guidance in the Makerspace will particularly help to address the physical needs of such mentoring. Virtual innovative lab spaces will allow youth to develop project ideas and engage in collaborative problem solving. The spaces will be accessible via mobile phone based Head-Mounted Displays. Student surveys, observation, social network analysis, and the systematic coding of interactions between youth and mentors will be used to research the nature of the collaboration, problem solving and innovation that occurs through shared making activities."

Content standards describe what math students are expected to learn at each grade level while practice standards characterize math behaviors that all students should experience (e.g., perseverance while problem solving and reasoning effectively about real-world situations). Problem solving is found at every grade level. If math teachers are expected to engage students in problem solving during everyday instruction, then students' problem-solving performance must be assessed in a manner that produces meaningful, valid, and reliable scores, without unduly burdening teachers or students. Unfortunately, most problem-solving assessments are generally framed by a set of mathematics expectations that differ from state standards. Thus, results from those assessments are disconnected from the mathematics content that students learn in the classroom. Previously, this research team has built problem-solving measures for grades 6-8, which address this gap in framing and generates meaningful, valid, and reliable scores, and do not have unintended negative consequences on students. The current project, titled Developing and Evaluating Assessments of Problem Solving (DEAP), builds upon the team's prior work by creating problem-solving measures for grades 3-5.  The elementary assessments will be connected to the middle-grades assessments and will be available for use by school districts, researchers, and other education professionals seeking to effectively measure children's problem solving. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the aims of DEAP are (a) to create three new mathematical problem-solving assessments and gather validity evidence for their use, (b) link the problem-solving measures (PSMs) with prior problem-solving measures (i.e., PSM6, PSM7, and PSM8), and (c) develop a meaningful reporting system for the PSMs. The research questions are: (a) What are the psychometric properties of the PSM3, PSM4, and PSM5 as they relate to students' problem-solving performance? (b) How does the evidence support vertical equating (linking) of the PSM3, PSM4, PSM5, PSM6, PSM7, and PSM8? (c) How do the PSM3, PSM4, and PSM5, and their related reporting systems impact teachers' instructional decision making when used formatively? Year 1 focuses on item and test development. The study will conduct cognitive interviews and administer tests with a small group of students to explore how items and tests function. Rasch (1-PL) measurement will be employed, similar to prior PSM development. Year 2 includes further pilot testing and gathering validity evidence through cognitive interviews and test administration. Year 3 has a final round of pilot testing and selection of linking items for vertical equating. Year 4 involves pilot testing the PSM series with linking items and developing a reporting system. DEAP's potential contributions to the field are three-fold. (1) Assessments will be available for use by the public. (2) A set of vertically equated problem-solving measures will allow users the opportunity to explore students' problem-solving performance as they matriculate across grade levels, which is currently not possible at the state or national level. (3) This project fills a need in the field as no set of measures uses vertical equating to assess elementary students' problem-solving performance in a rigorous fashion within the context of state testing."

Often, teachers are not sufficiently prepared to support their students' quantitative reasoning. The products generated by this project fill a need for concrete materials at the pre-service level that embody research-based knowledge in the area of quantitative reasoning. The accessible collection of research and educational products provides a model program for changing prospective mathematics teachers' quantitative reasoning that is adoptable at other institutions across the nation.  Additionally, the support of early CAREER scholars in mathematics education will add to the capacity of the country to address issues in mathematics education in the future. <br/><br/>Advancing Reasoning addresses the lack of materials for teacher education by investigating pre-service secondary mathematics teachers' quantitative reasoning in the context of secondary mathematics concepts including function and algebra. The project extends prior research in quantitative reasoning to develop differentiated instructional experiences and curriculum that support prospective teachers' quantitative reasoning and produce shifts in their knowledge. Three interrelated research questions guide the project: (i) What aspects of quantitative reasoning provide support for prospective teachers' understanding of major secondary mathematics concepts such as function and algebra? (ii) How can instruction support prospective teachers' quantitative reasoning in the context of the teaching and learning of major secondary mathematics concepts such as function and algebra? (iii) How do the understandings prospective teachers hold upon entering a pre-service program support or inhibit their quantitative reasoning?  Advancing Reasoning addresses these questions by enacting an iterative, multi-phase study with 200 prospective teachers enrolled in a secondary mathematics education content course over 5 years. The main phase of the study implements a series of classroom design experiments to produce knowledge on central aspects of prospective teachers' quantitative reasoning and the instructional experiences that support such reasoning. By drawing this knowledge from a classroom setting, Advancing Reasoning contributes research-based and practice-driven deliverables that improve the teaching and learning of mathematics."

To improve student success in 8th grade algebra, ACES  is  targeting the critical juncture in the mathematics education continuum as students move from elementary concepts to algebra.  The vision is to create and sustain professional learning communities (PLCs) who work collaboratively to provide high quality instruction and continuously improve mathematics instruction. Teachers develop a view of math as exciting and interesting and gain a broad and deep understanding of the curriculum within and across grade levels. <br/><br/>ACES is developing a distributed, classroom-based, cadre of 60 grade-level teacher leaders who adopt math as their area of expertise and provide math leadership to colleagues.  Project goals include: 1) increase the mathematics understanding and achievement of (grades 4-8) students; 2) increase teachers' mathematical conceptual content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and effective application of pedagogical skills; 3) cultivate replicable cultural and systemic changes that result in continuous improvement of mathematics instruction; and 4) conduct empirical research to increase evidence-based contributions to the teaching and learning knowledge base. Program components include: 1) intensive summer institutes; 2) monthly workshops; 3) PLCs focused on use of lesson study; and 4) teacher collaboration time.  Innovative features include creating a new model for classroom-based capacity building in which a cadre of grade-level mathematics lead teachers gradually increase their mathematics knowledge, earn mathematics certification, and become lesson study facilitators.  Instead of removing teachers from the classroom to assume coaching type assignments, the program creates a new model for distributed grade-level leadership involving a widespread network of teacher leaders who remain in the classroom, whose professionalism is highly respected by their colleagues and administration, who guide their peers in enhancing their teaching, and whose leadership is a natural outcome of this professionalism rather than a district-appointed position.  At the university, lesson study is being introduced into the pre-service teacher education program by math faculty engaging in lesson study for teaching math courses to pre-service elementary teachers, and education faculty utilizing a lesson study model for math and science methods courses in the credential program.  The research focuses on the degree to which teacher variables of mathematics content and pedagogical knowledge, goal structure for students, approach to instruction and to improving instruction, self-efficacy to teach mathematics, and classroom teaching performance predict student mathematics achievement, self-efficacy to do mathematics, goals orientation, and perceptions of goal structure."

The project will enable 249 students (mostly under-served, i.e., economically disadvantaged, ethnic minorities and racial minorities) to enroll in AP Physics - the students would otherwise not have access. These students either prepare for the AP Physics 1 exam by completing a highly interactive, conceptually rich, rigorous online course, complete with virtual lab experiments, or participate in an accredited AP course that also includes weekly hands-on labs. In this project, the model will be tested and perfected with more students and expanded to AP Physics 2. Further, model replication will be tested at an additional site, beyond the two pilot sites. In the first pilot year in Massachusetts at Boston University, results indicated that students fully engaged in Project Accelerate are (1) at least as well prepared as peer groups in traditional classrooms to succeed on the AP Physics 1 exam and (2) more inclined to engage in additional STEM programs and to pursue STEM fields and programs than they were prior to participating. In the second year of the pilot study, Project Accelerate doubled in size and expanded in partnership with West Virginia University. From lessons learned in the pilot years, key changes are being made, which are expected to increase success.  Project Accelerate provides a potential solution to a significant national problem of too few under-served young people having access to high quality physics education, often resulting in these students being ill prepared to enter STEM careers and programs in college. Project Accelerate is a scalable model to empower these students to achieve STEM success, replicable at sites across the country (not only in physics, but potentially across fourteen AP subjects). The project could potentially lead to the success of tens of thousands of motivated but under-served students who attend schools where the opportunity to engage in a rigorous STEM curriculum is not available. <br/><br/>Project Accelerate blends the supportive structures of a student's home school, a private online course designed specifically with the needs of under-served populations in mind, and hands-on laboratory experiences, to make AP Physics accessible to under-served students. The goals of the project are: 1) have an additional 249 students, over three years, complete the College Board-accredited AP Physics 1 course or the AP Physics 1 Preparatory course; 2) add an additional replication site, with a total of three universities participating by the end of the project; 3) develop formal protocols so Project Accelerate can be replicated easily and with fidelity at sites across the nation; 4) develop formal protocols so the project can be self-sustaining at a reasonable cost (about $500 per student participant); 5) build an AP Physics 2 course, giving students who come through AP Physics 1 a second year of rigorous experience to help further prepare them for college and career success; 6) create additional rich interactive content, such as simulations and video-based experiments, to add to what is already in the AP Physics 1 prep course and to build the AP Physics 2 prep course - the key is to actively engage students with the material and include scaffolding to support the targeted population; 7) carry out qualitative and quantitative education research, identifying features of the program that work for the target population, as well as identifying areas for improvement. This project will support the growing body of research on the effectiveness of online and blended (combining online and in-person components) courses, and investigate the use of such courses with under-represented high school students."

This project addresses the fundamental issue of how and under what conditions beginning Grades 3 to 7 teachers of mathematics improve their PCK, what learning opportunities play a role in beginning teachers' PCK growth, and what the learning trajectories look like for beginning mathematics teachers. Although this project primarily focuses on teachers' PCK development in the areas of fractions and proportional reasoning, it has the potential to inform research on teachers' PCK development in other topic areas or disciplines. The work will contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of the learning opportunities that are key to beginning teachers' learning and knowledge development, and the results of this research will have the potential to guide the work of and interventions by researchers and teacher educators.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the aims of DEAP are (a) to create three new mathematical problem-solving assessments and gather validity evidence for their use, (b) link the problem-solving measures (PSMs) with prior problem-solving measures (i.e., PSM6, PSM7, and PSM8), and (c) develop a meaningful reporting system for the PSMs. The research questions are: (a) What are the psychometric properties of the PSM3, PSM4, and PSM5 as they relate to students' problem-solving performance? (b) How does the evidence support vertical equating (linking) of the PSM3, PSM4, PSM5, PSM6, PSM7, and PSM8? (c) How do the PSM3, PSM4, and PSM5, and their related reporting systems impact teachers' instructional decision making when used formatively? Year 1 focuses on item and test development. The study will conduct cognitive interviews and administer tests with a small group of students to explore how items and tests function. Rasch (1-PL) measurement will be employed, similar to prior PSM development. Year 2 includes further pilot testing and gathering validity evidence through cognitive interviews and test administration. Year 3 has a final round of pilot testing and selection of linking items for vertical equating. Year 4 involves pilot testing the PSM series with linking items and developing a reporting system. DEAP's potential contributions to the field are three-fold. (1) Assessments will be available for use by the public. (2) A set of vertically equated problem-solving measures will allow users the opportunity to explore students' problem-solving performance as they matriculate across grade levels, which is currently not possible at the state or national level. (3) This project fills a need in the field as no set of measures uses vertical equating to assess elementary students' problem-solving performance in a rigorous fashion within the context of state testing."

Evaluation of the current Mobile Making program has documented positive impacts on participants' interest, self-efficacy, and perception of the relevance of Making/STEM in everyday life, and led to a model for engaging underserved youth in Making. The work will focus on implementing the program model sustainably at greater capacity by increasing the number of undergraduate activity leaders, after-school sites, and level of community engagement. The expanded Mobile Making program is expected to engage ~1800 middle school youth at 12 local school sites, with activities facilitated by ~1020 undergraduate CSU-SM STEM majors. The sites are in ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, with as many as 90% of students at some sites qualifying for free or reduced price lunch. The undergraduate facilitators are drawn from CSU-SM's diverse student body, which includes 44% underrepresented minorities. Outcomes are expected to include increases in the youth participants' interest, self-efficacy, and perception of the relevance of Making/STEM in everyday life. Positive impacts on the undergraduate facilitators will include broadened technical skills, increased leadership and 21st century skills, and increased lifelong interest in STEM outreach/informal science education. <br/><br/>The program is designed to achieve sustainability through innovative means such as involving undergraduate facilitators via Community Service Learning (rather than paid positions), and increased community engagement via development and support of a community of practice including local after-school providers, teachers, Makers, and University members. Evaluation of the program outcomes and lessons learned are expected to result in a comprehensive model for a sustainable, university-based after-school Making program with regional impact in underserved communities. Dissemination to other regions will be leveraged via CSU-SM's membership in the California State University (CSU) system, yielding a potential statewide impact. The support of the CSU Chancellor's Office and input from a CSU implementation group will ensure the applicability of the model to other regional university settings, identify common structural barriers and solutions, and increase the probability of secondary implementations.<br/><br/>This work is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments."

The makerspace movement has gained recognition and momentum, which has resulted in many schools integrating makerspace technologies and related curricular practices into the classroom.  The study will focus narrowly on establishing a foundational understanding of how to ameliorate barriers to engaging in design learning through the use of metacognitive strategies. The project plans to translate and apply research on the use of metacognitive strategies in supporting struggling learners to develop approaches that teachers can implement to increase opportunities for students who are the most difficult to reach academically. Project strategies, curricula, and other resources will be disseminated through existing outreach websites, research briefs, peer-reviewed publications for researchers and practitioners, and a webinar for those interested in middle-school makerspaces for diverse learners.<br/><br/>The research will address the paucity of studies to inform practitioners about what pedagogical supports help struggling learners engage in these makerspace experiences. The project will focus on two populations of struggling learners in middle schools, students with learning disabilities, and students at risk for academic failure. The rationale for focusing on metacognition within makerspace activities comes from the literature on students with learning disabilities and other struggling learners that suggests that they have difficulty with metacognitive thinking. Multiple instruments will be used to measure metacognitive processes found to be pertinent within the research process. The project will tentatively focus on persistence (attitudes about making), iteration (productive struggle) and intentionality (plan with incremental steps). The work will result in an evidence base around new instructional practices for middle school students who are struggling learners so that they can experience more success during maker learning experiences."

The infrastructure to improve mathematics education in the US requires building human resources in mathematics and mathematics education into a professional community that can respond to the critical needs in the field. This project seeks to build a professional community with shared understanding of the specialized content knowledge (SCK) - the special forms and ways of reasoning about mathematical knowledge used in teaching (MKT). This community will help increase the capacity for further research and development on teachers' SCK in mathematics, which has been shown to relate to student achievement.  Building on the professional community's shared knowledge, the project will also work to collaboratively develop an item bank of MKT/SCK items and tasks using the platform developed by the Illustrative Mathematics group for similar task and item development for K-12 students. Better measures, with a larger item bank, will help support both the learning and assessment of teachers' MKT/SCK. <br/><br/>Based on theories of communities of practice, this project will bring together mathematicians and mathematics educators to build a professional community with a shared understanding of the SCK in mathematics through engaging in efforts to develop items to measure SCK and the development of a task bank. Based on the ""item camps"" they engaged with to develop prior measures, the project will host twelve 4-day camps with varying themes for pairs of faculty and teachers or graduate students, ensuring a mix of mathematicians and educators. This work will lead to a certification for MKT/SCK. They will also develop approximately 60 items and have a mechanism for the future review and publishing of items. Using case-study methodologies, the project will study the development of these partnerships and the professional communities within and across the camps."

This influence occurs, in large part, through playful parent-child interactions and conversations that expose children to mathematical and spatial concepts in interesting and useful ways. For example, parents of preschool children are often encouraged to use puzzles, board games, and construction activities to foster children's spatial thinking and early math skills. However, mastery-oriented toys like these typically elicit highly structured interactions, with parents directing children to follow explicit step-by-step instructions and game rules. Although this kind of parent-directed play can build content knowledge in STEM, it does little to encourage the kind of intrinsically-motivated discovery, generative collaboration, and creative problem-solving skills that support STEM education and attainment. This research in service to practice project seeks to understand how parents can play with their preschool children in ways that build children's STEM skills while also supporting children's social-emotional skills. As such, this research has the potential for advancing knowledge on effective strategies for enriching informal learning opportunities in under-resourced and sparsely populated communities where access to children's museums and other informal learning institutions is limited. <br/><br/>Over a period of three years, approximately 135 children and parents from a rural Appalachian community are expected to participate in this research, which is organized into three phases. During Phase 1, human-centered design processes will be used to develop and refine play guides and parent scaffolds that promote productive pretend play, which is characterized by joyful and creative problem-solving and rich parent/child conversations featuring mathematical and spatial concepts and reasoning. In Phase 2, measures will be developed and validated to operationalize and code this kind of productive parent-child play and play guides will be tested and refined in a local children's museum. In the final phase, a formal field test will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of outreach programming involving the use of play guides over time. Pre-, mid-, and post-intervention measures will estimate program impact on child STEM and social-emotional skill acquisition, relative to a comparison group. An expected outcome of the project will be research-based educational materials that illustrate and support pretend play in ways that generate spatial and mathematical thinking and parent/child conversations. These materials will will be made available to families and informal learning practitioners. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

Most major challenges that confront society today, such as generating sufficient energy, preventing and treating diseases, maintaining supplies of clean water and food, and addressing other critical environmental problems, are ""socio-scientific."" Efforts to integrate these issues into science instruction have not fully succeeded because they include (1) the intrinsic complexity of these issues, rendering them difficult to reason about even for adults; (2) inadequate involvement of teachers in initial phases and (3) the difficulty and discomfort of facilitating classroom discussions of controversial, emotionally fraught issues that don't have single right answers.

Using stratified near-peer and peer-to-peer mentoring approaches, the pilot builds on extant literature that indicates that peer-supported hands-on mentoring and experiences can alleviate some barriers to youth engagement in digital technologies, particularly among underrepresented groups. In this project, undergraduate students will mentor and work collaboratively with high school youth primarily of Hispanic descent and community-based organizations to develop creative technology-based solutions to address social issues and challenges within their local communities, culminating in events called Impactathons. These community-hosted local and state-wide events set this pilot project apart from similar work in the field. The Impactathons not only provide a space for intellectual discourse and problem-solving among the undergraduate-youth-community partners but the Impactathons will also codify expertise from scientists, social scientists, technologists, community leaders, and other stakeholders to develop technology-based solutions with real world application. If successful, a distal outcome will be increased youth interest in digital technologies and related fields. In the short term, favorable findings will provide preliminary evidence of success and lay the foundation for a more extensive study in the future.<br/><br/>This pilot project is a collaboration between the Everett Program, a student-led program for Technology and Social Change at the University of California Santa Cruz - a Hispanic Serving Institution - and the Digital NEST, a non-profit, high-tech youth career development and collaboration space for young people ages 14-24. Through this partnership and other recruitment efforts, an estimated 70-90 individuals will participate in the Impactathon pilot program over two years. Nearly two-thirds of the participants are expected to be undergraduate students. They will receive extensive training in near-peer and peer-to-peer mentoring and serve as mentors for and co-innovation developers with the high school youth participants. The undergraduates and youth will partner with local community organizations to identify a local social challenge that can be addressed through a technology-based solution. The emergent challenges will vary and could span the spectrum of STEM and applied social science topics of interest. Working in informal contexts (i.e., afterschool. weekend), the undergraduate-youth-community partner teams will work collaboratively to develop practical technology-based solutions to real world challenges. The teams will convene three times per year, locally and statewide, at student and community led Impactathons to share their work and glean insights from other teams to refine their innovations. In parallel, the research team will examine the effectiveness of the Impactathon model in increasing the undergraduate and youths' interest, motivation, excitement, engagement and learning of digital technologies.

Given the centrality of the role of proof, and the persistent difficulties in teaching proof in the K-12 and undergraduate curriculum, the topic is of vital importance. The work is novel, focusing on an area of proof that is understudied, the introduction of students to the topic of proof. While building on prior work in proof, the project will tackle an important area of beginning to teach proof, which may lead to broader innovations at both the K-12 and undergraduate level. The project will produce a resource, a set of lessons, which can be used widely and are likely to be broadly disseminated based on the PI's previous NSF-supported work, which has been broadly disseminated to practitioner audiences. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop an intervention to support the teaching and learning of proof in the context of geometry. This study takes as its premise that if we introduce proof, by first teaching students particular sub-goals of proof, such as how to draw a conclusion from a given statement and a definition, then students will be more successful with constructing proofs on their own. The 5-year design and development study builds on the researcher's prior work from a Knowles Science Teaching Fellowship (KSTF) grant to study how teachers introduce proof to students. This study will build on the prior work to refine a framework for introducing proof developed in the KSTF study. Using this framework the researcher will work with five high school geometry teachers to develop lessons via Lesson Study methods to introduce sub-goals of proof. The PI will study the impact of the use of these lessons on students' ability to perform proofs, and compare to students of ten teachers who will not have participated in the intervention."

The project design framework is based on Participatory Design (PD), which capitalizes on the relationships formed, processes engaged, and products made during the ethnographic phase, to collaborate with youth engaged in making practices to design guidelines for others to participate in culturally relevant making.  Using Participatory Design as a framework for democratic innovation, the project use will the products and ideas of young makers to drive innovation of guidelines for culturally representative making activities and new ways of using existing tools that increase equity in making."

This account implies that neurocognitive architectures tuned to the processing of non-symbolic ratio--such as the relative lengths of two lines or the relative areas of two figures--are present even before learners receive fractions instruction."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>U.S. elementary teachers face many challenges.  They are asked to teach all subjects to students with different needs and abilities.  To do this well, they need good professional learning opportunities.  Many teachers look online for such opportunities, but little is known about the quality of those opportunities and how they can be improved to help teachers meet their challenges.  The goals of this project are to learn more about how teachers use one popular website for elementary mathematics teachers and how this website and similar ones can be adapted to better support teacher learning.  Specifically, the project will (1) interview teachers about their use of the website, (2) investigate how to improve the ways teachers interact with video resources on the site by testing different ways of guiding their attention, and (3) examine how teachers' interactions with these video resources are related to their students' learning of mathematics.  Findings from this project will be used to build and share effective ways to support teacher learning online.  The project will thus benefit teachers who use the popular website, teachers who use similar websites, researchers who study how teachers learn from such websites, and the students of teachers who learn from such websites.<br/><br/>Video-based learning has been the focus of much professional development research over the past decade.  As video-based learning has been found to be effective, many professional developers have taken this learning to scale through the online space.  A number of high profile and popular virtual learning communities (VLCs) have emerged to allow teachers to interact with video, but the scant number of studies on the effectiveness of such VLCs show some difficulties in engaging teachers in sustained, reflective professional learning.  The purpose of this project is to investigate several major issues in the design and implementation of effective VLCs for teachers and to examine the relation between teachers' reflective engagement with VLCs and their students' mathematics learning outcomes.  The investigators propose 3 studies, which build on each other, to address these issues.  This project will (1) interview teachers who are members of a popular VLC, to investigate what they learn and how they contribute to community; (2) investigate conditions that impact the posting of reflective commentary about video cases through iterative experiments, as reflective commentary has the potential to build community and to support teacher learning; and (3) investigate the relation between reflective reactions to video cases and student mathematics outcomes.  Through these investigations, this project will explore issues that impact the scalability of teachers learning asynchronously from online video.  Results will be used to develop guided pathways - a prototype of an innovation that will be based on the results from the research - on one widely used VLC.  Thus, this project will provide both a contribution to the field of STEM teacher education research and an immediate, research-based product that can be disseminated to thousands of teachers through an existing VLC."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The 3-year exploratory project, Conceptual Model-based Problem Solving: A Response to Intervention Program for Students with Learning Difficulties in Mathematics, will develop a cross-platform mathematics tutoring program that addresses the problem-solving skill difficulties of second- and third-grade students with learning disabilities in mathematics (LDM). While mathematics problem-solving skills are critical in all areas of daily life, many students with LDM do not acquire key math concepts such as additive and multiplicative reasoning in a proficient manner during the early school years. In fact, about 5-10% of school-age children are identified as having mathematical disabilities which might cause them to experience considerable difficulties in the upper grades and experience persistent academic, life, and work challenges. Despite the proliferation of web-based mathematical games for early learners, there are very few programs or tools that target growth in the conceptual understanding of fundamental mathematical ideas, which is essential in enabling young students with LDM to perform proficiently in mathematical and everyday contexts. COMPS-A is a computer-generated instructional program focusing on additive word problem solving; it will provide tutoring specifically tailored to each individual student's learning profile in real time. COMPS-A will also make the reasoning and underlying mathematical model more explicit to them, and the tool's flexibility will facilitate group or one-on-one instruction in regular classroom settings, in other sessions during or after the school day, and at home. COMPS-A addresses a significant practical issue in today's classrooms by providing individualized and effective RtI intervention programs for students with LDM.<br/><br/>COMPS-A program represents a mathematical model-based problem-solving approach that emphasizes understanding and representation of mathematical relations in algebraic equations and, thus, will support growth in generalized problem-solving skills.COMPS-A will achieve the following objectives: 1) Create the curriculum content, screen design, and a teacher's manual for all four modules in the area of additive word problem solving; 2) Design and develop the cross-platform computer application that can be ported as a web-based, iPad, Android, or Windows app, and this flexibility will make the program accessible to all students; and 3) Conduct small-scale single subject design and randomized controlled trial studies to evaluate the potential of COMPS-A to enhance students' word problem-solving performance. The following research questions will be resolved: (1) What is the functional relationship between the COMPS-A program and students' performance in additive mathematics problem solving? (2) What is the teacher's role in identifying students' misconceptions, alternative reasoning, and knowledge gaps when students are not responsive to the intervention program? (3) What are the necessary instructional scaffolds that will address students' knowledge gaps and therefore facilitate the connection between students' conceptual schemes and the mathematical models necessary for problem solving in order to promote meaningful understanding and construction of additive reasoning? A functional prototype of the COMPS-A will be developed followed by a single-subject design study with a small group of students with LDM to field-test the initial program. Finally, a pretest-posttest, comparison group design with random assignment of participants to groups will then be used to examine the effects of the two intervention conditions: COMPS-A and business as usual. An extensive dissemination plan will enable the project team to share results to a wider community that is responsible for educating all students and, especially, students with LDM."

Little is known about what types of professional development (PD) support teachers' improved practice and student learning. However, federal, state, and local governments spend resources on helping teachers improve their teaching practice and students' learning. PD programs vary in their intent and can fall on a continuum from highly adaptive, with great latitude in the implementation, to highly specified, with little ability to adapt the program during implementation. The project will study the design and development of PD that supports teacher development and student learning, and provide accumulation of evidence to inform teacher educators, administrators, teachers, and policymakers of factors associated with successful PD experiences and variation across teachers and types of PDs. The impact study will expand on the evidence of promise from four 2015 National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects - two adaptive, two specified - to provide evidence of the impact of the projects on teachers' instructional practice over time. Although the four projects are different in terms of structure and design elements, they all share the goal to support challenging mathematics content, practice standards, and differentiation techniques to support culturally and linguistically diverse, underrepresented populations. Understanding the nature of the professional development including structure and design elements, and unpacking what teachers take up and use in their instructional practice potentially has widespread use to support student learning in diverse contexts, especially those serving disadvantaged and underrepresented student populations. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program, which funds research and development on STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>This study will examine teachers' uptake of mathematics content, pedagogy and materials from different types of professional development in order to understand and unpack the factors that are associated with what teachers take up and use two-three years beyond their original PD experience: Two specified 1) An Efficacy Study of the Learning and Teaching Geometry PD Materials: Examining Impact and Context-Based Adaptations (Jennifer Jacobs, Karen Koellner & Nanette Seago), 2) Visual Access to Mathematics: Professional Development for Teachers of English Learners (Mark Driscoll, Johanna Nikula, & Pamela Buffington), two adaptive: 3) Refining a Model with Tools to Develop Math PD Leaders: An Implementation Study (Hilda Borko & Janet Carlson), 4), TRUmath and Lesson Study: Supporting Fundamental and Sustainable Improvement in High School Mathematics Teaching (Suzanne Donovan, Phil Tucher, & Catherine Lewis). The project will utilize a multi-case method which centers on a common focus of what content, pedagogy and materials teachers take up from PD experiences. Using a specified sampling procedure, the project will select 8 teachers from each of the four PD projects to serve as case study teachers. Subsequently, the project will conduct a cross case analysis focusing on variation among and between teachers and different types of PD. The research questions that guide the project's impact study are: RQ1: What is the nature of what teachers take up and use after participating in professional development workshops? RQ2: What factors influence what teachers take up and use and in what ways? RQ3: How does a professional development's position on the specified-adaptive continuum affect what teachers take up and use?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is essential that STEM professionals effectively and efficiently communicate and justify processes, and find and fix mistakes.  In this project, researchers will investigate how students' explanations during play, and the use of step-by-step demonstrations of problem-solving, called worked examples,  can enable early elementary school students, female students in particular, to gain familiarity and competency with commenting and debugging computer programming code. Establishing these practices in elementary education could help create a workforce where commenting on code and explaining one's process of thinking is natural and expected.  The project will connect students' programming experiences with those of industry professionals in an effort to increase their interest in future STEM careers.  <br/><br/>Over a series of interventional sessions, pairs of first- and third-graders will work in partners to learn how to program using the Coding Awbie game by OSMO(TM).  In particular, researchers will investigate the following research questions over two years: (1) How and when do first- and third-graders comment on and debug their code during free-play compared to when they are asked to explain what they will do before playing, i.e., explained play? (2) How does students' commenting and debugging compare and change depending on if they analyze worked examples before or after their play? (3) How does students' commenting and debugging of worked examples relate to their explaining and correcting errors in mathematics problems in addition to computer coding?  (4) How does the intervention affect students' early attitudes toward programming and knowledge of the role of programming in STEM professions? Measures include programming and mathematics explanation and debugging tasks as well as surveys related to programming.  Through this repeated measures design, researchers will learn what conditions best support students' explaining and debugging while learning to code within the program, and students will gain important STEM practices in their early years of elementary education.  Further, presentations by industry professionals will help connect the practices to a variety of STEM careers, helping students see the relevance of the practices of explaining and debugging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Collaboratory seeks to address and reframe the gap between research and practice in K-12 STEM education.  This gap persists despite decades of work by many leading organizations, associations, and individuals.  Attempts to close the gap have generally focused on creating resources and mechanisms that first explain or illustrate ""what research says"" and then invite educators to access and integrate findings into practice.  Recently, however, attention has turned to the ways in which the medical sciences are addressing the gap between research and clinical practice through the developing field of ""translational research.""  In medicine, the strategy has been to shift the focus from adoption to adaptation of research into practice.  Implicit in the notion of adaptation is a bi-directional process of cultural exchange in which both researchers and practitioners come to understand how the knowledge products of each field can strengthen the professional activities in the other.  Along these lines, the R+P Collaboratory is working with leading professional associations and STEM improvement efforts to leverage their existing knowledge and experience and to build sustainable strategies for closing the gap.  Activities include:<br/><br/>     -  Collecting, creating and synthesizing translational research resources to expand STEM educators' and educational leaders' access and awareness to current relevant research.<br/>     -  Supporting multiple opportunities for cross-sector (research and practice; education and social sciences; formal and informal) meetings to foster critical engagement and cultural exchange. <br/>     -  Testing, documenting and innovating new resources and mechanisms at Adaptation Sites and disseminating both products and results through the R+P Resource Center. <br/><br/>The R+P Collaboratory is developing an online 'Go-To' Resource Center website that houses the resources collected, created, and curated by the Collaboratory.  The Resource Center also has significant 'Take-Out' features, with all materials meta-tagged so that they can be automatically uploaded, reformatted, and integrated into the existing communication and professional development mechanisms (e.g., newsletters, digests, conferences, and websites) of a dozen leading professional associations within a Professional Association Partner Network.<br/><br/>In light of new and emerging standards in the STEM disciplines, the Collaboratory is focusing its work on four salient and timely bodies of research: (a) STEM Practices, (b) Formative Assessment, (c) Cyberlearning, and (d) Learning as a Cross-Setting Phenomenon.  Special emphasis is being placed on research and practice that focuses on the learning of children and youth from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The work of the R+P Collaboratory includes research and evaluation of its own efforts through studies aimed at answering the following questions:<br/>     -  How are Collaboratory resources and engagement activities accessed, experienced and leveraged by participants?<br/>     -  What resources, mechanisms and learning contexts support cultural exchange among STEM education researchers and practitioners?<br/>     -  What new kinds of practices result when research-based evidence is adapted into evidence-based practices, and how does it change learning opportunities for K-12 aged children?<br/>     -  How can effective strategies, mechanisms and resources of the Collaboratory be scaled and adapted to new contexts?"

The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), whose membership includes the major mathematics and statistics societies, will host a conference to initiate a national effort bridging the gaps between high school and college mathematics. The specific goal of this conference will be the creation of state-based teams---incorporating leaders in K-12, two-year colleges, and the state's higher education system---that will coordinate action to improve the articulation of high school through post-secondary mathematics education. The conference will be followed by an 18- month period of networking and support, leading to a second forum to report on progress, accomplishments, and obstacles encountered. The project will result in a synthesis of the states' action plans to be shared broadly and serve as a guide for other states. The formal assessment of their progress will produce information that will be extremely valuable to other states. By facilitating better communication and articulation across the high school to college divide and paying attention to the personal and social skills that often impede student progress, we should see the implementation of programs that create improved student readiness for post-secondary education and improved success. This program has the potential for broad impact across all categories of students, with particularly strong implications for students who are currently at most risk, including students from under-resourced schools, from under-represented minorities, and those who are in their family's first generation to go to college. These are the students who are most at risk and who would benefit the most from well-crafted state-based efforts to improve this articulation. This project is supported with funding from the Discovery Research PreK-12 and Improving Undergraduate STEM Education programs. <br/><br/>This effort will build on the existing work by the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas, Austin, and will draw on recent reports and recommendations of CBMS member societies. The conference will be built around 20 to 25 state-based teams, each team representing the state's department of education, the flagship university and higher education system, and the two-year college system. Teams will also draw on state leaders who have been engaged in efforts to improve mathematics education at either the high school or college level. This forum, planned for spring of 2019, will bring together teams from the participating states to learn what other states have done; to get acquainted with the recommendations, programs, and supports that are available; and to plan their own course of action. The large-scale and multi-venue effort at implementation that will be conducted as follow-up to this conference provides a unique opportunity to study these issues and learn strategies that are effective within different state contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study builds upon NSF-funded research by two of the investigators that followed engineering students through their undergraduate engineering experiences; this project represents a next step towards improving engineering education and furthering learning sciences research in neglected areas like STEM workplace learning. The engineers studied in this project will be recent graduates, taking positions typical of students from their institutions, and in economically important or expanding engineering sectors.  The central methodology will be learning ethnographies, an innovative approach using ethnographic fieldwork to discover what these new engineers need to learn, how they learn it, what they appear to adapt or use readily from their prior educational experience, and the consequences of these for their workplace participation and developing identities as engineers.  The learning ethnographies will ground two further aspects of the study: a comparison of workplace practices with those of these engineers' undergraduate programs, and a survey generalizing ethnographic findings to a broader population.  Women and members of underrepresented minority groups will be oversampled to provide a basis for comparative analysis intended to understand distinctive experiences and challenges that members of these groups may face as they move into the workplace.  <br/><br/>Lack of continuity between school and work in engineering is often noted, but details of mismatches are insufficiently understood to effectively inform practice; this research addresses this gap in understanding.  For industry, it can inform reorganization of workplace practices to better facilitate transitions from school to work.  For undergraduate programs, the research can provide a basis for educational practices to be adopted or deemphasized, allowing schools of engineering to better prepare students to be creative and successful engineers. For students, this research may lead to the development of more relevant and practically useful engineering knowledge and more accurate understandings of their possible future careers. It is also expected that this research will inform attempts at recruitment and retention of members of underrepresented groups."

With increasing threats to Native lands and traditions, there is an urgent need to promote ecological sustainability awareness and opportunities among all stakeholders within and beyond the impacted areas. This is especially true among the dozens of tribes and over 50,000 members of the Coast Salish Nations in the Pacific Northwest United States. The youth within these communities are particularly vulnerable. This Innovations in Development project endeavors to address this serious concern by implementing a multidimensional, multigenerational model aimed at intersecting traditional ecological knowledge with contemporary knowledge to promote: (a) environmental sustainability awareness, (b) increased STEM knowledge and skills across various scientific domains, and (c) STEM fields and workforce opportunities within Coast Salish communities. Building on results from a prior pilot study, the project will be grounded on eight guiding principles. These principles will be reflected in all aspects of the project including an innovative, culturally responsive toolkit, curriculum, museum exhibit and programming, workshops, and a newly established community of practice.  If successful, this project could provide new insights on effective mechanisms for not only promoting STEM knowledge and skills within informal contexts among Coast Salish communities but also awareness and social change around issues of environmental sustainability in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>Over a five-year period, the project will build upon an extant curriculum and findings codified in a pilot study. Each aspect of the pilot work will be refined to ensure that the model established in this Innovations and Development project is coherent, comprehensive, and replicable.  Workshops and internships will prepare up to 200 Coast Salish Nation informal community educators to implement the model within their communities. Over 2,500 Coast Salish Nation and Swinomish youth, adults, educators, and elders are expected to be directly impacted by the workshops, internships, curriculum and online toolkit. Another 300 learners of diverse ages are expected to benefit from portable teaching collections developed by the project.  Through a partnership with the Washington State Burke Natural History Museum, an exhibit and museum programming based on the model will be developed and accessible in the Museum, potentially reaching another 35,000 people each year. The project evaluation will assess the extent to which the following expected outcomes are achieved: (a) increased awareness and understanding of Indigenous environmental sustainability challenges; (b) increased skills in developing and implementing education programs through an Indigenous lens; (c) increased interest in and awareness of the environmental sciences and other STEM disciplines and fields; and (d) sustainable relationships among the Coast Salish Nations. A process evaluation will be conducted to formatively monitor and assess the work. A cross cultural team, including a recognized Coast Salish Indigenous evaluator, will lead the summative evaluation. The project team is experienced and led by representatives from the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, Oregon State University, Garden Raised Bounty, the Center for Lifelong STEM Learning, the Urban Indian Research Institute, Feed Seven Generations, and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

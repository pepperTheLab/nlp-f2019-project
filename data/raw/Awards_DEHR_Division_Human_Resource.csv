The Phase II Center will build on accomplishments of the first 6 years of the program, with a continued focus on optical sciences and applied physics.  The CREOSA has been leading systemic and transformative educational, research, and outreach programs at Delaware State University, a Historically Black University.  A new doctoral program in Optics has been initiated (the only one at an HBCU), leveraged the CREST award to secure funds for construction of a new building dedicated to optics research, increased scholarly publications by a factor of 6, enabled the hiring of 9 new faculty members, licensed the first intellectual property for DSU, and provided graduate student training of a new generation of optical scientists, mostly from minority groups.  The Center also was instrumental in creating a culture of innovative integration to foster interdepartmental and multidisciplinary research and education at DSU. The continued support by the NSF for CREOSA has enable Delaware State to achieve national prominence in optical sciences while serving the minority population of students that will attend and will be drawn to DSU. <br/> <br/>Center Vision<br/>CREOSA will be a sustainable unit that seeks to achieve national prominence in research and education in optical sciences with a strong commitment to educate, train, and prepare traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>Center Mission<br/>CREOSA will integrate multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches to (1) Perform cutting-edge research in optical sciences; (2) Provide world-class education in optical sciences with a focus on serving historically underrepresented groups in STEM; (3) Improve the research infrastructure in optical sciences at DSU; and (4) Enhance significantly the diversity of the workforce with backgrounds in optical sciences by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research and education at all levels which includes the population groups from K-12, undergraduate, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>CREOSA will exploit the interdisciplinary nature of research activities across fields of optics, biology, biochemistry, mathematics and computational sciences. Three research subprojects form the foundation of the Center's research and educational activities:<br/><br/>1. Spectroscopy and Imaging of Biomacromolecules in Crowded and Complex Media<br/>This subproject brings together optical sciences and biological sciences at the technological cutting edge.  The research has the potential to attain unprecedented limits for the accurate detection, identification, and classification of diverse bio-macromolecules in their host environments.  These biomolecules may serve as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and are the key idea behind the rapidly developing research in the field of nanomedicine.<br/><br/>2. Spin Polarization Spectrosopy in Nanodiamond for Nanoscale Sensing and Imaging<br/>The subproject team will investigate spectroscopic methods of studying nanoscale materials.  The work complements the activity of the first subproject, in that it will provide avenues to probe single and/or complex biomacromolecules.  These materials may provide an important driver in the development of solid-state quantum information processing.<br/><br/>3. A System for Interactive Data Mining in Experimental Optics <br/>This subproject will link experimental optics with important elements of data mining. The research proposed in both of the first two subprojects will create a large amount of complex data, which will require an integrated approach in which data-driven machine learning techniques are coupled with idealized models and expert knowledge in the analysis of spectroscopic data. The techniques to be developed will help resolve the communication bottleneck that occurs when several scientists in multidisciplinary optics research collaborate and exchange experimental data and extracted information.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>More than 65% of the students at Delaware State are African American, and the new doctoral program established from the Phase I award is an important resource for that population, both in terms of advanced graduate programs and as a model for the role of research in stimulating more students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM degrees.  A partnership with the Fisk-Vanderbilt doctoral bridge program has been initiated, which will stimulate pathways IN BOTH DIRECTIONS for these institutions.  An active professional development program for graduate students will be initiated, concurrent with a well organized recruitment and mentoring activities.  The program will also be at the heart of recruitment efforts for undergraduate students to matriculate in STEM fields at DSU and from URM groups in Delaware elsewhere, because of the high visibility of the optical sciences program.<br/><br/>DSU will continue outreach activities for pre-college students and the general community, such as a summer program that has prepared 89 students from 23 universities during the first five years, sponsorship of events such as open houses for the Delaware Science Alliance and Physics Days.  The project will continue the enhancement of the curriculum at DSU, across several academic platforms.  These include new tracks in electrical engineering, optical engineering, and bio-engineering in the Department of Physics and Pre-Engineering, as well as updates to the curricula for physics and physics education.  New educational laboratories will be developed as part of the world-class imaging facilities that are part of a new building being constructed.<br/><br/>The research investigations have the potential for profound impact on human health and counterterrorism.  The work will provide a stronger scientific foundation that could yield new technologies for medical diagnostics of early signs of disease and to detect pathogens used to fight bio-terrorism.  <br/><br/>This award has been partially funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research at the National Science Foundation."

Louis Stokes Regional Centers of Excellence in Broadening Participation (LSRCE) are designed to serve as regional testbeds for outreach, knowledge-generating and diffusion activities or other activities that contribute to successful practices in STEM education.<br/><br/>Developing a stronger, more diverse STEM workforce is a clear national need to promote economic prosperity and maintain global leadership in science.  Work toward that end is in accord with the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science.  To address this need, the Louisiana State University (LSU) Office of Strategic Initiatives proposes a Louis Stokes Regional Center of Excellence in Broadening Participation, entitled ""LSRCE: Center for Promotion of Academic Careers through Motivational Opportunities to Develop Emerging Leaders in STEM (LS-PAC MODELS).""  Specifically, the vision for this Center is to create a successful, data-driven model for increasing underrepresented minority (URM) preparation for academic careers (i.e., an effective model with well-tested strategies).  This Center will cement an alliance between LSU and IBM, with IBM assisting in data management, organization, and strategizing focused data collection to aid in early promotion of best practices.  The goals of this alliance are to (1) increase the quality and quantity of URM STEM students pursuing doctoral degrees within the LSAMP collaborating institutions through mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students; (2) increase retention to graduation rate of underrepresented STEM PhD students; (3) develop a national model and platform for increasing the number of URM minority STEM PhD recipients, and (4) develop a model for increasing placement of URM PhDs into the professoriate and to minimize attrition once they get there.  <br/><br/>With data and use of IBM consulting and software, the Center's social science researchers will examine the strength of social network connections and how those strengthen URM students' learning experiences, and whether corresponding increases in career resources occur.  This will contribute scientific knowledge to the theoretical understanding of how social capital in the form of mentorship can be acquired in computer-supported collaborative learning environments.  Data gathered with assistance from IBM will also allow members of the alliance to examine cognitive and personality characteristics of URM students that predict success along with the development of intellectual and intra- and interpersonal skills and wellbeing.  The aggregate of these data will be used for iterative processes during the creation of the mentoring platform in collaboration with IBM.  Ultimately, an interactive App and website will be created, manuscripts will be published in top-quality journals, and a book of best practices in mentoring URMs to the professoriate will be developed.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF INCLUDES which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Center conducts research and prepares a workforce that can tackle some of the most challenging problems confronting society. The interdisciplinary research at the Center has resulted in tools and approaches that support scholarly interdisciplinary collaboration by facilitating the ability to share knowledge, concepts, approaches, and perspectives. As national leaders in the study of collaborative science and engineering, the Center has developed and applied models of team-based, cooperative learning, interdisciplinary teamwork, and knowledge integration. Areas of advancement in cyberinfrastructure (CI) have been in data management, data analysis, and virtual organizations in support of collaboration. In particular, CI research has focused on scientists' ability to document data collection and product development in ways that enable sharing and reuse of scientific results by enhancing results with provenance and other critical information.<br/><br/>The Center's crosscutting expertise is in collaboration and collaborative environments, semantic-based approaches to knowledge synthesis and representation (ontologies and provenance), and propagation of uncertainty in integrated analyses.  The subprojects through which this expertise will transcend are as follows:<br/><br/>(1) Knowledge Representation, Negotiation and Integration: Linking Human and Machine Knowledge Models through Semantics<br/><br/>(2) Advancing Understanding of Ecosystem Processes Using Cyberinfrastructure<br/><br/>(3) Integrated Analysis for Development of 3-D Models of Earth Structure<br/><br/>Cyber-ShARE's research in analysis of climate change impacts on the environment and the modeling of Earth's structure has advanced through the Center's interdisciplinary approaches supported by CI. Our environmental science group is advancing understanding of carbon flux in extreme desert and arctic environments through innovative multi-scale data collection and analysis, along with novel methods for minimizing error propagation and ensuring data quality.  Our geophysics research group is developing more accurate models of the Rio Grande Rift System through computational approaches to data integration and model fusion. The Center has developed novel tools that allow researchers to more effectively analyze the large amounts of data being collected through environmental and seismic sensor networks in these projects and around our nation.  Sensor data are critical for understanding short and long term global change, enabling better understanding of the effects of climate change on water and energy, and the effects of earth structure on earthquake risk. <br/><br/>In the next phase of funding, the Cyber-ShARE Center will continue to conduct innovative, synergistic STEM research supported by CI in the areas of environmental science and geosciences.  Among a large number of research questions to be investigated as part of the three subprojects are the following:  <br/><br/>How can we create a machine understandable representation of individual mental models and integrated conceptual frameworks for interdisciplinary research, facilitated by advanced cyber-infrastructure?<br/><br/>What factors control land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, water and energy in desert and arctic terrestrial ecosystems and over what spatial and time scales?<br/><br/>How can Semantic Web technologies be used to enhance open access environmental data sharing, discovery, retrieval, integration, analysis, and visualization?<br/><br/>What is the evolution of the Rio Grande Rift and how does this relate to other active rifts, for example, the East Africa Rift System?<br/><br/>Can scientists understand, believe and accept new insights in the tectonic evolution of the southwest (and other regions) that were produced through the development of CI and CI-based applications that can seamlessly integrate and optimally fuse existing information sources?<br/><br/>The Center is critical to broadening training and education of interdisciplinary, CI-knowledgeable citizens, including STEM students who receive advanced degrees and represent the 21st century demographics.  Compared to the national averages for graduate students in geology and environmental and computer science (NSF 2008), Cyber-ShARE students are 82.7% Hispanic while the national average is 4.7%, and 36.5% female while the national average is 30.8%.

To maximize this potential, the project will use science games (e.g. Land Science, River City, and EcoMUVE), shown to be enjoyable to students and proven to promote student learning in science at the middle school level. Through a two-phase process, games will be used as vehicles for learning about ways to change how students think about science and potentially STEM careers. The goal of the intervention is to explore which processes and design features of science games will actually help students move beyond a temporary identity of being a scientist or engineer (as portrayed while playing the game) to one where students began to see themselves in real STEM careers.  Students' participation will be guided by teams of teachers, faculty members, and graduate students from Drexel University and a local school. All science students attending the local inner city middle school in Philadelphia, PA, will participate in the intervention.<br/><br/>Using an exploratory mixed-method design, the first two years of the project will focus on exploring, characterizing, coding, and analyzing data sets from three large games designed to help students think about possible careers in science.  During year 3, the project will integrate lessons learned from the first two years into the existing middle school science curriculum to engage students in a one-year intervention using PCaRD (Play Curricular activity Reflection Discussion). During the intervention, the PI will work with experts from Drexel University and a local school to collect data on the design features of Land Science to capture identity change in the science identity of the participating students. Throughout the course of year 3, the PI will observe, video, interview, survey, and use written tasks to uncover if the Land Science game is influencing students' identity in any way (from a temporary to a long-term perspective about being a scientist or engineer). Data collected during three specified waves during the intervention will be compared to analyses of existing logged data through collaborations with researchers at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These comparisons will focus on similar middle-aged science students who used the same gaming environments as the students involved in this study. However, the researcher will intentionally look for characteristics related to motivation, science knowledge, and science identity change.  <br/><br/>This project will integrate research and education to investigate learning as a process of change in student science identity within situated environmental contexts of digital science gameplay around curricular and learning activities. This integrated approach will allow the researcher to explore how gaming is inextricably linked to the student as an individual while involved in the learning of domain specific content in science. The collaboration among major university and  school partners; the expertise of the researcher in educational psychology, educational technology, and science games; and the project's advisory board makes this a real-life opportunity for the researcher to use information that naturally exists in games to advance knowledge in the field about the value of gaming to changing students' science identities. It also responds to reports by the National Research Council committee on science learning and computer games, which identifies games as having the potential to catalyze new approaches to science learning."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Tropical Conservation Biology and Environmental Science (CREST-TCBES) at the University of Hawaii-Hilo. Communities in the tropics and subtropics depend on the economical, ecological, and cultural services provided by terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Recent research has provided evidence that Hawaiian ecosystems are exhibiting signs of reduced health and disease, a scenario likely related to rapid development in the Hawaiian Islands. This project will improve the capability of studying the impacts of disturbance and stressors on habitat structure and critical ecological processes by creating high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) habitat reconstructions of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems across a gradient of disturbance regimes. This work will promote the progress of science and help preserve valuable ecosystem services that affect the prosperity and welfare of humans. K-12 students and local communities will be engaged in this project to support education and diversity. Interactive data visualizations and immersive virtual reality technologies will be hosted online to captivate audiences while providing educational material. This study will provide new outreach products designed to engage global audiences and broaden participation in science. <br/><br/>This project will apply innovative techniques to advance ecological and biological research by collating 3D reconstruction, molecular characterization, bioinformatics, and statistical modeling. The research goals of this project aim to characterize the molecular profiles of eukaryote-prokaryote symbioses and address fundamental questions about how environmental change affects ecological systems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The research methods will integrate 3D structure-from-motion reconstruction technology and data visualization tools to provide a new context for which to decipher patterns and relationships occurring in both molecular and ecological processes. The key elements of the project are 1) creating 3D reconstructions of study organisms used for examining eukaryote-prokaryote symbioses, and 2) developing 3D habitat maps for study sites used to examine the role of anthropogenic and environmental change on the community structure and physiological responses of several organisms. The data visualization tools will allow for annotating the 3D models with multiple forms of biological and ecological data to statistically examine relationships among the experimental variables in a 3D spatial context. This innovative approach can test the hypothesis that eukaryote-prokaryote symbioses exhibit reciprocal effects on gene expression and metabolite abundance of the study organisms. The proposed research will also quantify 3D habitat structure to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbance and habitat fragmentation affects the genetic structure, survival, reproductive success, and acoustic signaling of organisms. The outcomes of the proposed CREST-PRF will provide the basis to develop new web applications to display data and findings from all CREST sub-projects, thus amplifying the impact of the CREST investment at the University of Hawaii-Hilo."

The study focuses on approximately 900 urban youth who are high interest, high potential STEM students who participate in, or are alumni of, the Science Research Mentoring Program. This program provides intensive mentoring for high school youth from groups underrepresented in STEM careers.  It takes place at 17 sites around New York City, including American Museum of Natural History, which is the original program site. Identifying key supports and obstacles in the pathways of high-interest, under-represented youth towards STEM careers can help practitioners design more inclusive and equitable STEM learning experiences and supports. In this way, the project will capitalize on student interest so that students with potential continue to persist.<br/><br/>In order to understand better the factors that influence these students, this research combines longitudinal social network and survey data with interviews and case studies, as well as an analysis of matched student data from New York City Public Schools' records. The research questions in the study are a) how do youths' social networks develop through their participation in scientists' communities of practice? b) what is the relationship between features of the communities of practice and youths' social networks, measures of academic achievement, and youths' pursuit of a STEM major? and c) what are the variations in youth pathways in relationship to learner characteristics, composition of social networks, and features of the community of practice? The research design allows for a rich, layered perspective of student pathways. In particular, by employing social network analysis, this study will reveal relational features of persistence that may be particularly critical for underrepresented youth, for whom STEM role models and cultural brokers provide an otherwise unavailable sense of belonging and identity in STEM. The study will also access a New York City Public Schools data set comprised of student-level records containing biographical and demographic variables, secondary and postsecondary course enrollment and grades, exam scores, persistence/graduation indicators, linked responses to post-secondary surveys, and post-education employment records and wages. These data enable examination of inter-relationships between in-school achievement and out-of-school STEM experiences through comparison of program participants to similar non-participant peers.

From middle school through college, girls and women have performed less well on standardized tests in science and mathematics than their male peers and express less confidence and aspirations in these fields. Similar findings emerge for Black and Latino students in terms of STEM self-concept and aspirations. Recently, the gender gap in science and math performance has been closing but the gap in STEM self-concept and aspirations remains large. What drives these gender and race disparities in STEM? Many girls and students of color lose interest in STEM before college partly because the stereotype of the successful student in STEM is male, White or Asian, and nerdy. Girls are particularly affected by STEM stereotypes because of their incompatibility with gender role expectations. The proposed research in this grant focuses on solutions to the leaky pipeline by investigating peer influences and classroom dynamics that protect adolescent girls from STEM stereotypes using the Stereotype Inoculation Model.  This present work concentrates on contact with other girl peers in science and math classrooms as ""social vaccines"" who inoculate adolescent girls' mind against negative stereotypes. Four objectives guide this work: (1) To examine whether learning STEM with all-girl peers vs. mixed-sex peers in middle school enhances girls' engagement in STEM. (2) To assess whether the presence of all-girl peers has similar effects on Black and Hispanic girls (who face gender and racial stereotypes in STEM) compared to White girls (who face gender but not racial stereotypes). (3) To identify features of classroom peer dynamics that predict girls' STEM outcomes and test whether they occur differentially in all-female vs. mixed-sex classes. (4) To test if peer dynamics identified as beneficial produce the same positive outcomes for girls when put in action in mixed-sex classes. This research will be conducted by Nilanjana Dasgupta, Principal Investigator at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, in partnership with Catherine Riegle-Crumb, Co-Investigator at the University of Texas at Austin, and a diverse team of middle schools spread across the nation.<br/><br/>Two studies are proposed. Study 1 provides an in-depth analysis of peer dynamics in math and science classrooms in middle school and tests the extent to which they predict student outcomes in STEM. Using a longitudinal quasi-experimental design this study will compare girls in single-sex classes in science and math with girls and boys in coed classes and follow their progress across one year in middle school. Hierarchical regression and propensity score analysis will be the primary data analytic technique. The goal is to identify peer dynamics in class, measure whether they occur differentially in all-girls classes vs. mixed-sex classes, and test the extent to which they predict girls' STEM outcomes. Once the most beneficial peer dynamics are identified, Study 2 will test whether these, when put in action in mixed-sex classrooms, produce the same benefits for girls in coed classes using a large nationally representative sample of American 8th graders from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, 2007 (TIMSS). TIMSS 2007 contains sufficient classroom-level information to estimate within-class peer dynamics and to test their relation to student outcomes. Hierarchical linear modeling will be the data analytic technique. Our goal is to look for converging and complementary evidence using multiple methods across two studies making it a powerful package.<br/><br/>The contribution of the proposed research is to identify specific types of peer influences and classroom dynamics in math and science classes that get girls hooked on STEM, increase their confidence, and motivate them to aspire higher. Another contribution is to examine whether these peer dynamics work similarly or differently for African American and Latina girls compared to their White peers. An important intended outcome is to translate the research findings into a set of concrete classroom practices, interventions, and learning methods that will be disseminated broadly to K-12 teachers, principals, education policy professionals, and other stakeholders in order to enhance STEM teaching practices and attract, retain, and advance more girls and students of color in STEM. Many of the classroom practices, interventions, and learning methods that emerge from this project are likely to generalize beyond K-12 classrooms to benefit women in college STEM classes. Thus, the dissemination plan for the proposed research will include STEM faculty, students, department chairs and deans in higher education institutions as well, to impact recruitment and retention of diverse groups of women in college. Another intended outcome of this research is to integrate knowledge across multiple disciplines (psychology, education, sociology) and generate new insights in the science of broadening participation by examining interactions among institutional (or macro) factors, classroom (or meso) factors, and individual (or micro) factors that influence adolescents?

This NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the NSF Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) program, which seeks to increase the retention and graduation rates of students pursuing associate or baccalaureate degrees in STEM. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>A nationally recognized alliance established in 2006, the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) serves as the lead partner and backbone of the CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance for broadening participation of Hispanics in computing. The Alliance aligns with the five characteristics of an INCLUDES Alliance Program for achieving impact and fostering collaboration: vision; partnerships; goals and metrics; leadership and communication; and the potential for expansion, sustainability, and scale. The vision of the Alliance is: By 2030, Hispanics will represent 20% or more of those who earn credentials in computing. Credentials are defined as degrees and certifications that lead to gainful employment and advancement in the field. Its mission is to grow and sustain a networked community committed to recruiting, retaining, and accelerating the progress of Hispanics in computing. The established Alliance partnerships (academia, industry, non-profits, and governmental entities), which share the Alliance's vision and commitment to transformative change, are located in the following regions: Southwest (Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico), West (California), Southeast (Florida and Puerto Rico), and North (Illinois, New Jersey, and New York). Other partnerships are with some of the most impactful Hispanic organizations in the country (Excelencia in Education, Great Minds in STEM, and SACNAS). It is these vested partnerships that have helped position CAHSI onto a national platform that recognizes the Alliance's record for increasing the number of Hispanics who are competitive in the computing workforce and academia. In order to grow as a national alliance, while at the same time maintaining quality services and staying laser-focused on a shared vision, the Alliance goals are to: expand its infrastructure; create 'on-the-ground' regional leads and connectors to keep members engaged; focus on reinforcing activities that address local, regional, and cultural needs; and foster a culture of results-based accountability. The data management and evaluation teams will collect and share three levels of evaluative data as metrics for progress and improvement: institutional and individual student data; alliance and regional data; and comparisons of alliance data to national data. A key component of leadership and communication is the relevant and meaningful interactions within regions, across regions, and nationally. To expand, sustain, and scale, the Alliance leadership will build partnerships at the national level to advance Alliance partners' reach, resources, and impact on Hispanic students and faculty. Building trust and shared vision through regional leadership, fostering collective impact, maintaining effective communication channels, and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement are essential for sustainability.<br/><br/>To accelerate change, CAHSI aims to support institutions committed to advancing Hispanic students in computing; provide on-ramps for other alliances, non-governmental organizations, and partners; and prepare the next generation of CAHSI leaders. By creating distributed on-the-ground support through geographically-distributed regional leadership, Alliance institutions will deeply engage with partners to learn what works well and what can be improved within their specific contexts.  Led by a nationally renowned scholar, the CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance research investigation will contribute knowledge on what organizational conditions build capacity to transform development of culturally relevant and engaging educational strategies that support Hispanic students in computing. The investigation will provide valuable insight into institutional and pedagogical mechanisms to better serve Hispanic students in computing disciplines and in other STEM disciplines. Alliance efforts have the potential to scale organizational capacity-building efforts in a wider range of contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at North Carolina Central State University will investigate mathematical modeling with probability distributions and will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their statistical knowledge through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Georgetown University.<br/><br/>Count data arise in a variety of situations and are often modeled with a Poisson distribution. In many cases, however, the data do not satisfy the Poisson distribution's property of equal mean and variance. This project will examine the two-parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution that accounts for over-dispersion where the variance is greater than the mean and under-dispersion where the variance is less than the mean. The CMP distribution captures the Poisson, Bernoulli, and geometric distributions as special cases. The first goal of this project is to conduct a simulation study which compares properties of the CMP distribution to those of mixed Poisson probability distributions, such as the Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-Lindley and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, that have traditionally been used to model over-dispersed data. The second goal is to derive and develop inferential methods for a bivariate CMP distribution. To demonstrate the flexibility of the CMP distribution and its extensions, applications to real-world data will be considered. This research will expand the class of probability distributions that are available to model count data."

Expanding the STEM curricula offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about strategies that attract, retain and graduate American Indian students in engineering.  The Fort Peck Community College (FPCC) will develop a Pre-Engineering Associate of Science (AS) degree program that is transferrable to a bachelor-degree program in Engineering or a related STEM field.  The overall purpose of this work is to increase the number of American Indian students pursuing STEM career pathways and achieving STEM degrees at FPCC. The project addresses a growing need for engineers in the region, some of which can be attributed to region's fossil fuel and renewable energy activities. It is important to increase the number of STEM majors and graduates at FPCC as a means to assist Assiniboine and Sioux tribal members to enter these high-growth sectors of the workforce. The project expands FPCC's degree offerings to include a new AS degree in Pre-Engineering to meet the growing need for engineers in the region, use promising strategies from emerging research on  community colleges to improve instruction and student achievement in mathematics, build innovative supports to help students complete STEM associate degrees at FPCC and matriculate to STEM bachelor degrees, and expand the college's undergraduate research capacity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The project builds on and advances research on promising practices from emerging community college research to promote increased student math proficiency and success in STEM fields through early assessment, curriculum redesign and targeted tutoring, expanded access to learning supports, faculty development, transition support from two-year to four-year degrees, and authentic research experiences. The project will address research questions regarding the effect of these promising strategies with American Indian students pursuing STEM degrees.  The project is evaluated using a multi-dimensional approach that utilizes both qualitative and quantitative methods for collecting data. The evaluation plan is based on the tenets of a model for return on investment specifically designed for TCUs and based on the work of Phillips and Phillips. These measures and data elements will be used to evaluate how well the project is meeting its objectives to help the project leadership make data-driven decisions regarding project implementation and to derive research-based understanding of the impact of the strategies proposed. Formative data will be collected each semester to inform ongoing activities of the project and summative data will be used to make determinations regarding project successes, strengths, challenges, and recommendations for next steps."

The primary goal is to systematically investigate the effects of characteristics of contextualized items on student performance to strengthen practices in science assessments, ensure fairness in science testing, and increase support for both assessment and instructional purposes. Test items with contexts are called contextualized items which include supplemental information that precedes or follows a test item question. Such information may include a description of a lab setup, a natural phenomenon, or a practical problem often depicted as a scenario, background, vignette, or cover story. The project findings will help to understand how students make sense of contextualized items focusing on complex scientific concepts that they usually encounter in science assessments. Currently, contextualized items are constructed from either conventional wisdom or non-contextualized item writing rules. Such items could mislead students to attend to irrelevant information or interfere with the targeted construct, and, therefore lead to inaccurate inferences about student learning. This project will develop a framework for developing items to help address this problem. Approximately, 70 classroom teachers and 4800 students, in secondary grades, will participate in the study. <br/><br/>The project will offer a theoretical articulation of the characteristics of contextualized items and empirically test the effects on student performance. It seeks to address four gaps in the literature on contextualized items: (1) insufficient knowledge about how to conceptualize construct-relevant contextualized items; (2) lack of research on contextualized items in science; (3) lack of research that systematically studies the characteristics of contexts and evaluates their effects on student performance; and (4) the need for studies that examine differential effects related to subgroups of students to gain a greater clarity of what types of contexts affect whom. The research design and data analyses will be guided by three research questions: (1) what are critical context characteristics that may affect student performance and should therefore be considered when developing science test items? (2) what are context characteristics associated with construct-relevant variance? (3) what context characteristics are associated with differential student performance patterns due to gender, ELL status, and socioeconomic-status variables?<br/><br/>The project will take place over three years through a two phase process. During Phase 1 the project will refine a proposed theoretical framework that will identify the item context characteristics and articulate the item development guidelines. During Phase 2, the goal is to apply the framework by selecting, revising, and developing science items with varying profiles of contexts; conduct field tests of the items; and perform a range of psychometric and statistical procedures with test scores, and qualitative analyses of students' cognitive interview responses and teacher interviews. Items resulting from this process will aim to evoke students' stored knowledge relevant to the content and/or process skills targeted. The project will involve a team of researchers specialized in assessment development and validation, science education, content knowledge, linguists, and expert classroom teachers. The item development approach and items generated from this project will have immediate implications for researchers and practitioners in science education nationally and internationally."

Louis Stokes Regional Centers of Excellence in Broadening Participation (LSRCE) are designed to serve as regional testbeds for outreach, knowledge-generating and diffusion activities or other activities that contribute to successful practices in STEM education.<br/><br/>Developing a stronger, more diverse STEM workforce is a clear national need to promote economic prosperity and maintain global leadership in science.  Work toward that end is in accord with the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science.  Since 2004, the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's to PhD Bridge Program has broadened participation in STEM through identifying and promoting talent from historically underrepresented or underserved groups.  To date, bridge program participants have earned over 80 Master's degrees and 29 PhDs.  Of note, the retention rate to the PhD for the bridge program is 83% and 90% for the 8-year PhD completion rate, well above the national averages.  The broad goal of the Fisk University LSRCE work is to generate new knowledge about best practices to promote broadening participation that can be disseminated on a regional and national scale.  The Center have three objectives: 1) Build on their current publicly available toolkit to create a more comprehensive guide detailing the theory and research underlying the tools; 2) Research the effectiveness of program activities and create tools for internal evaluation and data collection that can be widely disseminated to the higher education community; and 3) Host a regional workshop focused on identifying best practices from other local institutions, disseminate the theory and tools from the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's to PhD Bridge Program guide, and connect practitioners with researchers.  The fundamental approach that the Center is taking to achieve these objectives is to develop a relationship with social scientists and educational researchers at the Vanderbilt Peabody School of Education and the American Institutes for Research.  Fisk University LSRCE seek to better explain the science of broadening participation, to advance understanding of best practices and simultaneously develop tools to ease the implementation of activities and interventions that promote the development of a more diverse STEM workforce.  The Center's work will be disseminated to the larger scientific community to promote adoption of these practices to the benefit of our nation.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF INCLUDES which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award to Howard University is co-funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Howard University has teamed with three other Historically Black Universities - Morgan State University, Hampton University, and Prairie View A & M University - to conduct a large empirical study of Black women undergraduate students in STEM. The overall goal of the project is to investigate the intersectionality of their existing identities (gender, race and disability) and the identity that they acquire as STEM students on their way to earning a degree and the impact of the intersectionality on their participation, retention and success. The project is guided by an evaluator, as well as an external advisory committee. <br/><br/>For decades, researchers have examined the issues related to broadening the participation, retention, and success of individuals underrepresented in STEM. However, there is limited data on Black women, who over time have become an increasingly larger portion of the available talent pool. Past research on women and Blacks in STEM has not focused on the identities of race, gender and disability. The identity of being Black and female uniquely influences the pathways that students take to reach degree goals and be successful in STEM careers. The study will investigate the impacts of the intersectionality of existing identities (gender, race and disability) and the academic identity that they acquire as STEM students. The researchers will use a triangulation mixed methods approach to longitudinally collect qualitative and quantitative data to learn participants' perspectives and experiences from freshman to senior year. Additionally, those participants who self-identify as a person with disabilities will be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Purposive sampling will be employed to ensure an adequate number of students with disabilities participate in the project's qualitative data collection. Once data are collected and disaggregated, the variance in the educational experiences of students along the variables of ethnicity, racial identity, gender identity, disability, and academic major will be examined. It is anticipated that a better understanding of the complexity of the identities of these women will inform inclusion practices, particularly at the collegiate level, and perhaps serve as a predictive element in success."

This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Spelman College aims to use data in the form of eye tracking to study actual migrant remittance decisions in partnership with RemitRight, an online startup company. The project will strengthen research capacity and provide educational opportunities to undergraduate students at Spelman College. <br/><br/>Migrant remittances are a significant driver of global development. Nonetheless, sending remittances remains costly. The creation of publicly available online or mobile comparison databases containing information on the cost, speed, and reliability of sending remittances is one of the most efficient means to increase transparency and reduce transaction costs.  This in turn requires such databases to be simple, accessible, and user-friendly.  This study will partner with a company that has built and maintains a World Bank-certified metasearch platform for online money transfers, to test behavioral foundations of comparison-shopping.  The main novelty of the study is the use of eye tracking to unpack ""the black box"" of experimentally elicited and naturally-occurring migrant remittance decisions. In so doing, the study sheds light on the behavioral foundations of search, choice, and information; how neuroeconomic data can be used to improve site customization and online or mobile comparison-shopping; and on the resulting welfare effects that could<br/>accrue to migrants and recipients. From a broader standpoint, the study will also provide evidence for how refined neureconomic data can be used to craft development policy. <br/><br/>This EAGER project is co-funded by the Directorates for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences and Education & Human Resources."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Prairie View A & M University (PVAMU) seeks to conduct a research project that bridges the academic units of biology, ecology, agriculture, bioinformatics and imaging.  This study assesses the impact of acetic acid on the two forms of Amaranthus palmeri and creates a baseline of genomic data. This project is a collaboration with the PVAMU Computational Center and provides funds for two undergraduates to engage in research each semester. Students involved with the project will be closely mentored. This will include teaching them new scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computational skills, preparing then to make poster presentations at local/national research symposia and/or conferences and discussing long term career goals. Project results will inform scientists and the agricultural community about which varying concentrations of acetic acid can best be used as a sustainable method of organic weed control. The idea for any growth control agent is to use the least amount of chemical and cause the least amount of change to the environment.<br/><br/>Traditional herbicides and growth control agents contain glyphosate based compounds and were initially thought to cause minimal change to the environment. After continued use of these compounds, scientists noticed that some weeds, including A. palmeri, became resistant to the glyphosate based herbicides, thus debunking the idea of minimal harm to the environment. The information gained from the study will provide significant information to evolutionary science because the two versions of A. palmeri evolved in a relatively short time frame. Changes in the genome from year to year and region to region will be assessed and related to acetic acid treatments. The genomic data will provide insight into the evolutionary changes at the genome level.  When plants are stressed, they often exhibit changes in the leaf structures, microbiota and genome.  Scanning Electron Microscopy will be used to determine the most vulnerable stages of plant development impacted by acetic acid and show changes in leaf surface structures and genetic profile. The study also analyzes the impact that timing of the application of acetic acid has on growth control. The results will have implications for other weeds. The project is expected to show that when acetic acid is applied early and before the desired crop emerges, there will be less change/damage to the environment. Applying acetic acid at the right time and using it as an organic weed control will serve as a model technique/practice for producers and will lower their cost while increasing productivity. This project is novel because it uses genomic data to assess the effects of acetic acid treatments at each stage of development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strengthening these educational opportunities serves to increase the number of Indigenous people attaining STEM degrees and thereby diversify the STEM workforce in the United States. The Health Status of the Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Water, Soil and Species Abundance Along the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline project supports these outcomes through its study of the ecosystems surrounding the pipeline. Led by an expert interdisciplinary team of environmental science faculty members from Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, the project focuses on gathering baseline data on species diversity, water quality, and soil characteristics of the areas on the reservation surrounding the pipeline. Faculty mentors also engage Native undergraduate and graduate students as integral members of the project, mentoring them in the design and conduct of the research and the presentation of its findings. The baseline information gathered in the study is an invaluable resource in helping further understanding of the environmental effects of pipelines over time and in formulating strategies for managing those effects. The ubiquitous presence of oil pipelines across the United States serving to meet the nation's energy needs makes this work highly relevant and significant to the American citizenry on a broad scale.<br/><br/>The focus of the Health Status of the Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Water, Soil and Species Abundance Along the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline is to conduct a baseline inventory of the species composition, water quality, and edaphic factors of various habitats surrounding the pipeline. Using sophisticated sampling techniques and state-of-the-art laboratory equipment, the project engages an interdisciplinary team of environmental scientists from Sitting Bull College in documenting, quantifying, and deriving relative abundance estimates of keystone species in the areas surrounding the pipeline on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The comprehensiveness and rigor of the data collection and analyses enable the study of the ecosystem across spatial and temporal scales. These data will be widely available and will be valuable in furthering current understanding of pipeline impacts as well as informing future studies and the formulation of remediation plans for this and other pipelines in the United States.  The collaboration of undergraduate and graduate level students with faculty mentors in the research design, implementation, and presentation contributes to the project?s broader impacts by developing the research capacity of the tribal college and its students."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Cyberinfrastructure for Sharing resources to Advance Research and Education (Cyber-ShARE) Center of Excellence at the University of Texas at El Paso. Earth sciences aim to determine the interior composition of the Earth by using a wide array of methods to understand its changes throughout the millennia and predict possible future behavior. For example, regions with relatively low seismic activity have experienced earthquakes due to motion of tectonic faults within the Earth's dynamic interior. Moreover, atypical plate tectonic processes, such as the breaking of a subducting oceanic plate that occurred with recent Mexico earthquakes in September 2017 make understanding the complex processes imperative to avoid future catastrophes. This research project will characterize the location and condition of seismological faults and the current state of ancient strains in the lower crust and address fundamental questions about the tectonic evolution of the Earth. Specifically, the project will develop and improve 3-Dimensional (3-D) Earth models in targeted regions through the optimization of the joint inversion of complementary seismic (surface wave group velocities and teleseismic P-wave receiver functions) and non-seismic (Bouguer gravity anomalies) datasets. The combined resolution of these datasets will allow pinpointing of key features within the subsurface that may be overlooked by the geophysical surveys. Early college, high school and traditional K-12 students will be engaged in this project.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will develop and apply numerical optimization to improve the resolution of 3-D Earth structure models. Although important methods have been previously developed to optimize the results obtained from the inversion of complementary datasets for increasingly complex geological environments, recent more powerful mathematical tools have provided evidence that constrained optimization techniques can greatly improve final structural models for the interior of the Earth. The use of primal-dual interior point methods for the joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic datasets can provide further improvement to 3-D imaging of the Earth by constraining the solution space and focusing only on feasible structural models. Part 1 of this project involves the development of computational algorithms to optimize the results obtained from the joint inversion of multiple datasets. In Part 2, the processes involved in the optimization will be analyzed to determine the optimal and most cost-effective division of work to simultaneously execute the code (parallel programming) in a multi-core environment. These algorithms will be applied to datasets from Colombia to obtain a new tectonic understanding of its complex substructure-characterized by a unique geological setting where the Cocos, Caribbean, and South American plates converge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigators will combine Community of Practice (COP) and Cultural Responsiveness (CR) theory into a framework to investigate the effectiveness of an innovation to better prepare students seeking to pursue careers as STEM teachers. They will use a mixed-methods research design to answer five research questions that a) bridge the COP/CR training with teacher efficacy, b) connect teacher competency with their mastery of the Texas College and Career Readiness standards, c) track how teachers' mastery of the Texas College and Career Readiness standards impact the performance of the students taught by the participants, d) capture the number of students transitioning to high school who select the STEM endorsement tract, and e) assess the effectiveness of the intervention.  The investigators will capture educators' confidence and ability to effectively teach and interact with middle schools via established self-report scales. Thus, the research will illuminate how these educators can affect student performance and their scores on the state's standardized tests. The underlying assumption is that teachers who undergo COP/CR training will positively influence students to pursue careers as STEM teachers and to remain in those careers.<br/><br/>The Community of Practice and Cultural Responsiveness practices adhere to the Framework for 21st Century Learning advocated by the Partnership for 21st Century Learning.  Approximately ten teachers will be recruited and trained, and five seventh grade science and five eighth math teachers will be placed in Alief ISD middle schools at the end of the project period. The study will address five research questions to achieve this outcome: (1) How does the infusion and training of COP/CR practices impact the efficacy of STEM teachers who teach minority students? A pre- and post-test design will be used to compare scores from the three subscales of the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. (2) To what degree do teachers who receive COP/CR training report enhanced knowledge of appropriate STEM practices as determined by the Texas Education Agency's College and Career Readiness standards?  Descriptive measures from teachers' self-report and lesson plans will provide indicators of the skills needed to motivate future teachers. (3) What are the math and science performances of students who are taught by the COP/CR training teachers? A causal-comparative design where classrooms with COP/CP teachers will be compared to classrooms taught by non-COP/CR trained teachers. Investigators also will use t-tests to test the difference in SAAR mathematics and science scores. (4) To what degree are students of the COP/CR trained teachers following a STEM endorsement path to enrolling in a STEM degree program? Investigators will apply a Pearson's Chi-square test of independence to analyze the data. (5) How has the initiative advanced the minimum Texas  STEM benchmarks for recruitment and retention of qualified STEM teachers and academic success in STEM-related subjects?

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The California Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) program was established in 1991 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of California.  Participating institutions include the University of California (UC) Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego.  The goals for the CAMP STEM Pathways and Research Alliance are to: (1) steadily and substantially increase the quality and quantity of minority students enrolled in STEM majors, (2) increase and sustain baccalaureate degree production, (3) expand undergraduate research opportunities, (4) increase enrollment in STEM graduate education programs, and (5) document the effectiveness of CAMP through robust evaluation and assessment.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""  The goals will be accomplished by enhanced student recruitment, selection and orientations; providing transfer students with additional academic and social support; faculty-mentored research programs; science writing through critical thinking; enrichment through attendance at symposia and travel to conferences; GRE preparation and guided graduate school applications; and organized annual conferences to showcase student research and inform students about STEM internship and job opportunities.  The said activities will produce higher rates of retention and graduation; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The knowledge generating research study will elucidate how faculty mentoring and the shared experience of presenting research at conferences impacts persistence and graduation rates in STEM fields as well as underrepresented minority student social-emotional parameters.  The research project will provide a valuable data set that can be shared across California and the nation to further increase the impact of LSAMP on increasing the diversity of STEM professionals in the workforce.

As such, this study will build on an emerging body of research about ways to broaden the representation of the African American undergraduate students in STEM fields. This type of research is highly important since studies show that racial bias weaken scientific identity in STEM by triggering and perpetuating threatening stereotypes that African Americans do not have the capacity and skills to become scientists. To that end, this  project will employ a stereotype inoculation model to test whether environments characterized by majorities of marginalized group members serve to reduce the negative effects of stereotypes, protect identity development, and facilitate self-efficacy and career-related motivation. The study will compare perceptions of campus climate and academic mentoring relationships using populations of undergraduate students from two universities. It will look at specific factors that both exacerbate and buffer the negative effects of racial stereotypes, as well as the implications that they, in turn, have for the development of an adaptive science identity.  <br/><br/>This project will test three conceptual models grounded in the stereotype inoculation framework. The first model will portray an erosion process whereby scientific disidentification increases as a function of racial bias and stereotype threat. A second counteractive model will test the potentially facilitative effects of racial identity on scientific self-efficacy through its spillover effect on scientific identity. The third model will examine the unconditional latent growth of implicit scientific identity, as well as the time-varying effects of students' perceptions of their mentoring relationships on the identity outcomes. Data will be collected from cohorts comprising more than 500 STEM majors attending the two universities participating in the project. Outcomes from this work will advance stereotype inoculation theory development through its innovative contextual focus on the micro- and macro-level processes that influence African American science students' STEM career attitudes. The study will also (a) provide insights into the mediating role that multiple identities, both racial and scientific identity, play in buffering these stereotypes, and (b) identify the interpersonal ingredients that comprise effective faculty-student relationships that give shape to multiculturally inclusive academic climates"

This project was created in response to the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program solicitation (NSF 16-544). The INCLUDES program is a comprehensive national initiative designed to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discoveries and innovations focused on NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in these fields.  The INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots represent bold, innovative ways for solving a broadening participation challenge in STEM.  <br/><br/>The full participation of all of America's STEM talent is critical to the advancement of science and engineering for national security, health and prosperity.  Our nation is advancing knowledge and practices to address a STEM achievement and the graduation gap between postsecondary STEM students who are women, URM, PWD, and persons from low socioeconomic backgrounds and males, non-URM, non-PWD, and persons from middle and upper socioeconomic backgrounds.  At the same time U.S. universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote a diverse STEM faculty as role models and academic leaders for historically underrepresented and traditionally underserved students to learn from, to work with and to emulate.

The methodology employed is novel and may yield new methods for using data mining techniques to explore data for other types of institutions. The outcomes could inform two-year HSIs (and other community colleges) about those strategies they could implement to facilitate successful STEM pathways for Latino(a) students."

This project awarded to a CAREER scholar at North Carolina A&T State University has the goal to understand the professional identity development (PID) processes of emerging women professionals in the fields or architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) towards informing educational and institutional transformations that strengthen women's persistence in becoming AEC professionals. This project integrates research and education by developing a year-round blended Professional Development Certificate Program (PDCP) and establishing the Emerging Built Environment Women (EBEW) center. This award is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program.  HBCU-UP encourages STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in broadening participation. <br/><br/>To achieve the goal of this project, robust foundational grounded theories will be constructed to provide nuanced insights into why and how the multiple identities, lived experiences and major concerns of undergraduate AEC women interact with their PID process.  A multi-year, multi-site, and multi-method constructivist approach to grounded theory research will be utilized with primary data obtained from intensive interviews with critical incident and symbolic interactionist emphasis. The comparative and iterative synthesis of coded and emergent data obtained from a cohort of undergraduate AEC women from five institutions over a four-year period will provide a longitudinal understanding of why and how their views and actions change with their lived experiences across educational stages. Methodological triangulation methods of data include textual analysis of formal documents and open-ended question surveys. Emergent theories from the research will inform practical implementation of the PDCP and the EBWE center and subsequent findings will provide greater insights into research findings. The construction of robust discipline-specific PID process theories will bridge gaps in identity and diversity theories and inform transformations for more gender inclusive AEC educational and institutional environments, which will enhance the early awareness, attraction, preparation, and persistence of the next generation of women AEC professionals. Theoretical foundations will guide future identity and diversity research that can be extended to other persistent male-dominant STEM disciplines. Improved gender inclusive environments will expand the pool of qualified AEC women for a more diverse AEC workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Water and the Environment (CWE) at the University of New Mexico. The objective of this project is to determine how longitudinal changes in the composition of dissolved organic carbon control nutrient uptake dynamics and export in arid-land river networks at multiple spatial (reach to river) and temporal (hours to years) scales.  Arid lands support approximately a third of the world's population and half of the world's agriculture.  Due to multiple competing stressors (e.g., dams, constant dewatering, fire ash inputs and increased evapotranspiration), and overreliance on water resources, arid-land river systems are typically less resilient and more vulnerable to water quality degradation, including eutrophication. Results from this project will provide tools to assess the fate and transport of carbon and nutrients in arid river systems, and scientific knowledge to support the development of multi-sector solutions aimed at improving nutrient recycling in arid metropolitan areas, within the context of the food, water and energy nexus.<br/><br/>The proposed research will continuously monitor nitrate, phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, and ancillary water quality parameters using state-of-the-art sensor technology for two years along a river continuum spanning four orders of magnitude in mean annual discharge, ~2000 m in altitude and ~500 km of stream length.  High-information-yield experiments to quantify carbon and nutrient uptake rates will be conducted every three weeks at the sensor sites along with laboratory analysis of dissolved organic carbon composition.  The research approach harnesses the power of ""big data"" by combining continuous sensor data, field experiments, and laboratory measurements with time-series analysis and data-based modeling techniques.  Spatiotemporally comprehensive information about the interconnections between chemistry, biology, hydrology and ecology along an entire river network collected by this project will generate datasets and modeling approaches to inform adaptive management of freshwater resources and establish guidelines for total maximum daily loads in arid land rivers.  Development of novel proxy relationships correlating continuous measurements to complex environmental parameters holds great potential to transform current understanding of watershed nutrient cycling and advance freshwater biogeochemistry."

This study will add to foundational knowledge by building theory about broadening participation of underrepresented minority groups (students of color, young women, students from low SES families, students with disabilities, English language learners), and intersections among them, in STEM education. The study will use data from the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM), the largest (to date) national randomized-controlled trial of a psychological intervention conducted with a national probability sample of public high schools and an over-sample of urban district schools, including over 18,000 students from 83 schools. The goal of the NSLM was to gain insights about ways to retain underrepresented students in the STEM pipeline. Through the intervention students were taught the concept of a growth mindset (the idea that the struggles in school are opportunities to learn, and do not mean you lack intelligence), and how to apply this concept in their schoolwork. Surveys assessed the growth mindset climates in math classrooms.  The present study will analyze NSLM data to investigate if 9th grade math classroom climates and students? use of a growth mindsets worked together to help students successfully complete advanced math and science courses in the early high school years. The four main objectives of the study include: (1) Coding 8th to 10th grade STEM course-taking patterns among students who participated in the NSLM and describing the extent to which minority groups are under-represented in advanced STEM coursework; (2) Testing whether a 9th grade math class with a strong growth mindset climate predicts higher rates of persistence in 10th grade STEM courses among students from under-represented groups; (3) Identifying the growth-oriented teacher practices that best create a growth mindset climate and increase STEM course persistence; and (4) Testing whether the effect on 10th grade STEM course persistence of a growth mindset intervention given directly to students in 9th grade depends on the 9th grade math classroom climate.<br/><br/>Analyses of NSLM data will present a unique opportunity to study why 9th grade math continues to be a gatekeeper course for many underrepresented students. The study will move beyond research that focused on letter grades (i.e. A, B, etc.) and instead focus on course taking patterns (i.e. taking Algebra II in 10th grade or not). Thus, it will advance knowledge about reducing attrition of underrepresented groups in rigorous math pathways. The combined use of quantitative techniques and an integrative theory will help address the ongoing national goal for diversifying the future STEM workforce. Intersectional analyses?which look at groups that have multiple disadvantages, such as students who are both in a racial minority group and who are learning English?are essential to uncovering a deeper understanding of inequities faced by these groups. To do so, the study will build a database that links student and teacher records to validate novel, efficient, and scalable assessments of math classroom climates and math teacher practices useful for improving instructional climates that narrow achievement gaps in high school trajectories. Last, this study will advance knowledge about scalable, low-cost interventions, and identify classrooms where such interventions are most or least effective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching purpose of the research is to investigate how to produce STEM graduates with argumentation expertise to address ill-structured problems that require scientific, evidence-based reasoning to inform decisions. The researchers will structure an intervention around units of biology and environmental science courses focused on scientific issues and conduct a three-phase research study. The Phase I pilot will determine the current argumentation level of STEM students and analyze the pilot data to identify gaps in effective socioscientific argumentation development. In Phase II, the researchers will develop and adapt a socioscientific argumentation learning training system for students. Phase III will be an experimental study to investigate the effect of socioscientific argumentation training on student outcomes. The significance of the study is that the findings can be used to provide students with skills and competencies needed for graduate school or the STEM workforce; namely, evaluation of evidence, construction of arguments, and evaluation of competing arguments.<br/><br/>The researchers will use a quasi-experimental design to answer three research questions: 1) What socioscientific argumentation strategies do the students currently use? 2) What gaps exist in effective socioscientific argumentation? 3) Does socioscientific argumentation instruction influence student outcomes?  In Phase 1, they will use socioscientific issues at the nexus of food, energy, and water for questionnaires, written reports, and debates to collect data on students' decision-making process, tendency to engage in arguments, argumentation levels, and quality of argumentative structures. The researchers will use several rubrics and socioscientific argumentation models to analyze data collected in Phase 1. They then propose to conduct a pre- and post- comparison of the quality of arguments on socioscientific issues between intervention and comparison groups. Measures of student academic success will be assessed from the dimensions of academic achievement, career success, attainment of learning outcomes, persistence, acquisition of skills and competencies, and satisfaction. The research will produce information needed to develop intervention models for improving scientific argumentation skills development of STEM students.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions."

The Phase II Center will initiate a new era, greatly expanding and improving its educational and research activities. Since its creation, the CGWA has become a major group-member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration (LSC), the world-wide collaboration of 800 scientists from more than 30 institutions and thirteen countries that seeks to make the first direct detection of gravitational waves and use them as a new window onto the universe. The next five years will see the CGWA involved in research in which gravitational-wave observations are routinely conducted in astronomy. This new era is also ushering in a new multi-disciplinary approach to study astrophysical phenomena, called multi-messenger astronomy.  The CGWA will pursue theoretical and experimental research activities, which seek to complement gravitational-wave detections with independent observations using optical and radio astronomy. The proposed research consists of: (i) Astrophysics, in collaboration with UTB's new Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA), that seeks to tie gravitational-wave observations to electromagnetic observations and astrophysical evolutionary theory; (ii) Data Analysis that concentrates on improved methods to search for gravitational waves, which can then be used as triggers for electromagnetic observations; and (iii) Detector Instrumentation that focuses on individual subsystems of the detectors and their noise-limited performance, with the goal to provide scientific guidelines for the concept and design of the next-generation of gravitational-wave detectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The Astrophysics Subproject supports multi-messenger astronomy by concentrating on the electromagnetic follow-ups of future triggers generated by gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced LIGO. The observational efforts at the Center include radio and optical follow-up of suspected gravitational waves from the collapse of compact binary stars. The population modeling aims at developing an astrophysical framework to understand the process of formation of such compact binary stars. The Data Analysis Subproject utilizes advanced statistical techniques to model realistic noise sources and provide improved estimates of astrophysical factors, such as the sky location of a gravitational-wave transient. The Instrumentation Subproject focuses its research on subsystems of current and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors. In particular, investigations of certain optical components, and experiments with test mass suspensions are crucial for finding the limitations of current and future gravitational wave detectors. Their relevance to LIGO, and to the scientific community in general, is only heightened by the fact that recent improvements in the growing network of gravitational-wave detectors greatly increase the probability of first detections shortly after the advanced detectors come on-line around 2015.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>A major educational impact will be realized with the CGWA Instrumentation effort, which involves students in experimental physics research and provides hands-on training in gravitational-wave detector subsystems. The CGWA Optics and Material Science laboratories offer unprecedented research experiences for students at UTB. The scholarship program for undergraduates, run by CARA, will provide mentorship for students and monitor their success through CARA's highly successful Arecibo Remote Command Center Program. The CGWA will also sustain a robust outreach effort to the community by providing access to its astronomical observatory to the general public. The CGWA visitors and conference program will provide a valuable resource for other interested scientists to get involved in the new field of the multi-messenger astronomy. The University of Texas at Brownsville is a Hispanic serving institution and consequently the CGWA's research and educational programs will play a major role in attracting Hispanic students to STEM disciplines in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the most educationally and socially underserved regions of the USA."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>The need for cultivating STEM talent has been well established. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. American students from diverse ethnic groups are underrepresented in STEM fields, and represent an untapped resource for the STEM workforce in the U.S. The University System of Maryland (USM) LSAMP, which began in 1995, will use STEM training as a conduit for mutual benefit of U.S. citizens: a program that at a basic level makes tomorrow better than today for as many students as possible, and a program that facilitates the conscious development of large numbers of underrepresented students with STEM skills who will contribute to America's innovation and competitiveness. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), lead institution of the USM LSAMP, in partnership with long-time alliance members the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), seeks to expand the alliance by adding new Associate Members from Towson University and Frostburg University, and Community College Collaborators from the STEM tracks of Prince George's Community College, Anne Arundel Community College, and the Community College of Baltimore County. The USM LSAMP will continue to build foundations for cultivating and mentoring the next generation of leaders through four pillars of STEM: (1) STEM Identity, (2) Sense of Community, (3) Strength-based Approaches, and (4) Institutional Culture Shift. The four pillars will be operationalized via four programmatic focus areas that are (1) Participation, (2) Performance, (3) Preparation, and (4) Presentation. Participation consists of a book-ended support structure. On the front end, bridge programming will be utilized for both incoming freshmen and community college transfer students. On the back end, preparation for graduate school will be integrated into the undergraduate experience to pave the way for STEM graduate degrees. Performance will focus on bolstering students' math performance. In addition to tutorial support throughout the year, USM LSAMP students will also have the opportunity to participate in the USM Winter Mathematics Institute. Preparation will emphasize undergraduate research as a pathway to the Ph.D. USM LSAMP students will have opportunities to conduct research during the academic year on each of the USM LSAMP campuses. The alliance will use presentation as a means to foster both professional and leadership development. Participants will have opportunities to present their research domestically and internationally. The leadership of USM LSAMP who are STEM professionals endeavor to change lives, families, and society by helping the next generation of STEM leaders pursue the path of STEM excellence. <br/><br/>The knowledge-generating research study, entitled ?Invoking STEM Identity through Purpose-Driven Research Preparation and Sense of Community?, will test a theory-driven model that positions racial/ethnic climate, science self-efficacy, sense of belonging, academic/social integration, and science identity as mediators to explain pathways to persistence and success in STEM. The model will be examined using both quantitative and qualitative data for the USM LSAMP program as a whole as well as for each program component. Whether the pathways differ by ethnicity, gender, and transfer status will also be explored."

The project will enhance the research capabilities of the PI as well as teaching and learning at Howard University. Undergraduate students will benefit from the collaborations with university and National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) partners and the research experiences and training in plant sciences. The project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of African Americans in plant sciences and support the nation's efforts in building a robust STEM workforce by engaging students early in their career. <br/> <br/>The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the evolution and origin of reproductive systems in plants, using Rumex as a model. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine the occurrence of different reproductive systems within the genus, 2) form a phylogenetic hypothesis of the evolution of these reproductive systems, and 3) revise infrageneric classification based on phylogenetic data. The project will undertake a global, comprehensive study of one large genus, Rumex. Findings from this study will include a well-sampled, robust phylogeny for the genus Rumex. A phylogenetic basis will allow for testing of evolutionary hypotheses and character reconstruction. In addition, a phylogenetic framework will provide a reference to test the monophyly of numerous subgeneric classification systems, and test the support for recognition of segregate genera. The global approach will produce a taxonomic and nomenclatural reference for Rumex.

This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552).  The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields.  AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers.<br/><br/>As our nation is confronted with a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, to work with and to emulate.  Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of the senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The California AGEP Alliance II has the potential to advance a model to improve the representation of URMs in STEM faculty positions, eventually providing URM STEM role models to STEM undergraduate and graduate students at postsecondary academic institutions across the Nation.<br/><br/>The California AGEP Alliance II will refine the community-of-practice, research exchange, mentoring and professional development components of the model while significantly increasing the dissemination of state-of-the art knowledge about equitable and inclusive educational and mentoring practices to faculty who work with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The integrated research will continue investigating the intersections of identity, structure and belonging, including goals 1) to firmly establish the role of a structured graduate program as a core explanatory variables that accounts for significant disparities among student groups in research participation; 2) to examine the simultaneous role of belonging, alongside structure, as two axes along which to map the ""psychological space"" of STEM departments, and to examine the interplay of structure and belonging; and 3) to zero in on the ways in which students' stigmatized identities may be particularly sensitive to structure and belonging.  Ethnographic and quantitative research methods will be used to address the research questions under investigation.  The AAAS Trellis program will provide an online platform for the partnering institutions' collaboration efforts, for disseminating model information to a national STEM community, and for linking participants in the alliance with public and private organizations.

The course redesign incorporates instructional strategies that teach and provide an environment to practice critical thinking. The goals are to enhance faculty expertise in critical thinking instruction, infuse critical thinking skill development in biology curricula using broad-based and discipline-specific pedagogical approaches, and to initiate the development of a resource center for critical thinking efforts and practices for the institution. <br/><br/>The project stems from the university?s strategic plan to review and/or modify academic programs to produce a more competitive global workforce and a series of faculty workshops on critical thinking. The existing Critical Thinking in Science Course ultimately was modified, and data showed that the students enrolled in the general course performed better in science gatekeeper courses than those who were not enrolled. The proposed project will extend this experiment by developing a discipline-specific course and pedagogical strategies for all biology majors.      <br/><br/>While the project is intended to target underrepresented students, the curriculum transformation to enhance the development of critical thinking skills will enhance STEM education in general and could impact undergraduate education at all types of institutions. Specifically, through traditional and non-traditional modes of dissemination, the best practices related to infusing critical thinking into STEM curricula will broadly introduce, inform, and expose faculty at HBCUs and other institutions to processes associated with improving STEM student success."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Aquatic Chemistry and the Environment (CAChE) at Florida International University. The project will focus on how mercury (Hg) affects organisms' physiology, vital rates, and local population growth.  The Everglades, a network of interconnected freshwater ecosystems that includes local areas contaminated by (Hg) and its methylated or organic form, methylmercury, will provide a natural laboratory for this study. The eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, will be used as a model species to document the demographic and population consequences of physiological stress induced by water contaminants (Hg). Since the eastern mosquitofish play a critical role in the Everglades food webs, this project will advance our knowledge and understanding of how human-induced contaminants affect aquatic biota. Findings from this study will be useful for designing conservation and restoration activities. The research will contribute to the postdoctoral training of a Latin American student, thus increasing the number of underrepresented minority candidates pursuing a career in STEM, an important goal of the CREST-CAChE. In addition, this research project will be integrated into the education and outreach program at the Center.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to determine whether the organism's physiological response to environmental stress regulates individual and population performance. Although other studies have examined the demographic consequences of stress in aquatic organisms, studies considering multiple life-history traits (e.g. growth, survival, and reproduction) are scarce. Furthermore, research examining how local population dynamics are affected by variation in patterns of resource allocation due to physiological stress, are warranted. This study will also test the life-history trade-off hypothesis as the basis to understand species' adaptation to environmental conditions by measuring the relationship between organisms' physiological conditions and demographic and population performance. This project will address such gaps by measuring, both in the field and in controlled lab experiments, the demographic response of G. holbrooki to mercury-induced physiological stress. The demographic data (growth, survival, and reproductive output) will be used to develop stage-based population matrix models to estimate population growth rates under different physiological pressures. By combining empirical physiological data with demographic modeling, the proposed study will be among the first to test such a relationship directly. The outcomes of this study will provide quantitative evidence of the success (or failure) of using physiological measurements as a biomarker to determine the effects of water contaminants in the demography and life-history traits of aquatic organisms."

Social capital refers to the social connections of students and the resources available through those connections. CMES refer to beliefs about how to succeed in an engineering program (i.e. degree attainment.) The study builds from the premise that women and minority undergraduates who succeed in engineering programs are more likely to 1) enter with and acquire/develop various forms/levels of social capital and 2) resolve conflicts between their CMES and the culture espoused by the program.<br/><br/>The proposed four-year longitudinal study, which builds on a prior research project, is guided by social capital and cultural model theoretical frameworks. The study will employ a mixed methods approach, specifically a partially mixed concurrent dominant status design in which both quantitative (online surveys) and qualitative (face-to-face and video interviews) data are collected concurrently. The data will be gathered from engineering students at eleven (11) diverse collaborating institutions (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Florida International University, Florida State University, Mercer University, Michigan State University, Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, University of Florida, University of Michigan, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, and University of South Florida). The outcome variables are: 1) the decision of entering students at these 11 institutions to pursue undergraduate engineering degrees and 2) retention of these students to the fourth year of their engineering programs. The two-fold goal of the research is to: 1) identify the effects of social capital and CMES on the retention and degree attainment of women and students traditionally underrepresented in engineering and 2) examine the relationship between social capital and CMES. An innovative aspect of the study is the use of cognitive diagnostic assessment (an extension of item response theory) to measure CMES. The results from the research project will make theoretical contributions in engineering education and is likely to transform cultures in engineering departments and facilitate the design of interventions that would broaden the participation of women and minorities."

In a post-recession context of rising income inequality, the importance of a college degree to the attainment of financial stability remains critical. This project looks at ways to address this continuing problem for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students in STEM disciplines at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT). The research is significant since college achievement, persistence and career attainment in STEM remain unequal by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income, both within and across group categories. Therefore, this research will examine continuing intersectional inequalities and explore what can be done to improve institutional policies and practices that might be promoting such conditions at VT. This research aligns well with the university President's Inclusion and Diversity Executive Council?s agenda, recently reorganized to advance a bold agenda for providing advocacy for inclusion programs and services throughout the university system.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's (PI) research will capitalize on the inclusion agenda through two overarching goals. The first goal is to identify and examine individual and institutional influences that lead to variance in college persistence, graduation and career outcomes by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income. The second goal is multi-tiered and aims to increase the number and diversity of professionals conducting STEM research through training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. This goal also increases the use of mixed-methodology by graduate and undergraduate students relative to postsecondary research; career trajectories; and the retention, graduation, and successful career attainment among targeted URM. This study is potentially transformative in that existing studies focus more on monolithic explanations for male or female pathways rather than intersectional inequalities.<br/><br/>The PI builds this project on an intersectional framework combining theories of structure and sociological gender theory to examine how the confluence of individual beliefs (meanings and utility) and institutional practices (policies and programs) in the college context affect student achievement, persistence, and college and degree attainment across categories of difference. The PI will use longitudinal in-depth interviews and secondary survey data to examine these individual and institutional factors. The in-depth interviews will be conducted in five waves with 500 URM undergraduate students. Additional focus group interviews will be conducted by dyads of peer interviewers. Surveys will be specific to VT and include multi-year common datasets as well as those administered to freshman, seniors, and other class levels on student enrollment, persistence, graduation rates, and financial aid. Data from the interviews and surveys will be analyzed to determine what steps VT might take to increase the participation of URM undergraduate students in STEM careers. The findings will also be disseminated nationally and internationally to fill gaps in the literature about how addressing intersectional inequalities might substantially improve URM participation in STEM."

The project at Winston Salem State University seeks to improve the motivation, engagement, and academic performance of students by building software that enables the organization of computer science and physics courses using game design principles and mechanisms. This approach is about motivating particular student behavior in a course through the use of game elements, such as instant feedback, freedom to fail, freedom of choice, leveling, progress bars, badges, and leaderboards. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project. <br/><br/>This project has the objectives to: implement a course gamification platform that can support the gamification of STEM courses; develop instructional materials for gamifying modules of two computing courses, Data Structures and Introduction to Database Systems, and one physics course, Principles of Physics; and evaluate the developed software and created instructional materials to assess their effect on student motivation, engagement, and academic performance. Course gamification, which leverages extrinsic and intrinsic motivators for engaging and motivating students to learn, has the potential to improve academic performance and contribute to increased retention and graduation rates in STEM disciplines. Therefore, the proposed gamification approach and supporting software will be especially beneficial for institutions whose students have low STEM graduation rates."

Surprisingly, the economic well-being of persons with disabilities has decreased since the passage of anti-discrimination laws such as the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.  However, STEM careers offer better financial outcomes for individuals with disabilities.  Additionally, economic projections suggest an increasing need to recruit more STEM majors, and students with disabilities are an under-recruited group who could help to meet this national economic need.  Undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities may be dissuaded from pursuing STEM careers by instructors and mentors who lack the knowledge to support the students' participation. This CAREER scholar is investigating the barriers and supports encountered by undergraduate and graduate physics students and early career physicists with disabilities in their learning and research experiences.  Results of this work provide information to college instructors and professional mentors to make physics more accessible and inclusive for persons with disabilities pursuing physics careers.<br/><br/>The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.  This award is supported through the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to explore how the attitudes toward and experiences of physics students and early career physicists vary across multiple components, including demographic variables, research experience, and physics sub-field.

The project will also measure changes in organizational practices that result from the interventions such as dashboards and new workload and reward system policies.  The outcomes of this project will have broad potential impact for other public state institutions, which are critical to improving the number of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students in STEM fields.

Twenty-one departments will act as controls and twenty-one departments will be experimental departments that will engage in four workload interventions over three years.  These interventions include: (1) the creation of workload dashboards to enhance transparency; (2) workload and reward system adjustments to remedy inequitable workloads by gender, race, and career stage; (3) individual career training and peer support for management of workload; and (4) department-wide faculty training on how unconscious bias and department organizational practices can affect workloads and harm careers.  The design allows systematic diagnosis and measurement of workload and gender and race inequality in new ways in a range of diverse departments and institutions.  By engaging a stratified random assignment design and collecting both climate and workload data from each control and experimental department, the project will measure both changes in faculty perceptions of workload fairness (procedural justice) and actual workload, policies and rewards (distributive justice).

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Alabama LSAMP is a completely reconstituted alliance that consists of 4-year institutions, doctoral-granting institutions, community colleges, high schools, and industry. The proposed activities that will expand the elements of the previous program consist of: performance-based stipend support, summer bridge programs, spring research conferences, community college bridge to 4-year institution programs, summer research experiences for high school and undergraduate students, and outreach to middle school students. The objectives of the proposed program are: To increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups who earn STEM undergraduate degrees; to enhance the STEM educational experience for underrepresented minority students; to increase retention and progression of underrepresented minority students to baccalaureate degrees; to enable successful transfer and matriculation of underrepresented minority students from 2-year to 4-year institutions in STEM programs; to increase access to high quality undergraduate research experiences; and to facilitate seamless transition of underrepresented minority students into STEM graduate programs. The expected benefits of the proposed program are: to contribute to a reversal of the loss of US STEM talent, the promotion of systemic change in institutional culture to enhance the retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM disciplines, increased matriculation of underrepresented minority students that transfer from community colleges into STEM disciplines, and sustained transformation of the undergraduate STEM educational experience. The proposed activities are important to advancing knowledge and understanding of sustainable best practices in STEM education and research experiences for undergraduates and will include a social science study and planned dissemination activities.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is: To implement and study innovative, evidence-based, sustainable best practices in STEM education and research experiences for undergraduates designed to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minority students by enhancing the STEM educational experience. At the heart of this research study is the question of whether variability in the content and length of a summer bridge program differentially impacts self-efficacy and belonging; and consequently, students' intentions to pursue a STEM degree and academic progress. This research may inform LSAMP programs nationally about how to structure summer bridge programs and contribute to models of stage-environment fit and our understanding of self-efficacy and belonging during school transitions. This study will examine how self-efficacy and belonging are affected by participation in the Alabama LSAMP program, and how they in turn are related to intentions to pursue a STEM degree. The study pays special attention to how different program elements, especially how those during the summer bridge program affect these factors over the transition to college. The effect of the timing and the amount of time spent in the following best practices for STEM retention will be examined: research, professional development, academic support, social integration and mentoring. The method for the research study will involve all LSAMP participants across the nine institutions each year (79 per year) which should result in data from approximately 395 students over the course of the 5-year study. Students will complete surveys (typically online) at intervals during the first year of the program and then once a year thereafter to track their progress. All students will complete a survey assessing self-efficacy, belonging, and intentions at the start of the summer bridge program (baseline). Before addressing the primary research questions, the psychometric qualities of each scale will be assessed. Factor analysis will be used to confirm or modify the scales so that they align with the intended psychological constructs. Factor analysis will also be used to determine if some measures can be combined to create scores that reflect larger meaningful constructs. Because students are nested in nine different institutions, hierarchical linear modeling is the most appropriate statistical tool. Additional models can be developed to examine how the timing and intensity of activities throughout the first year impact self-efficacy, belonging and intentions. These analyses will create a fuller picture of the transition process."

Virus specific biomolecules (anti-peptide and siRNA) with known properties will be used to functionalize nanomaterials and apply them to inhibit virus replication.<br/><br/>2.  Nanobiomaterials as Anti-bacterial Agents<br/><br/>The second project focuses on applications of nanomaterials against bacteria. Many antibiotics are in the market but are resistant to many bacteria, necessitating the design of new classes of anti-bacterials. The research team will develop and apply novel nanomaterials that can destroy bacteria and stop their growth. The main goal is to understand the mechanisms by which nanomaterials kill bacteria.<br/><br/>3.  Regulation of Immune Cells Using Novel Nanomaterials: Merging Nanoimmunology and Nanogenomics<br/><br/>The third project will explore novel materials that could non-specifically enhance immune functions and reduce disease manifestations.  Proposed nano-biomaterials will be synthesized, characterized and tested in biological systems using nanoscience tools and techniques.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The Phase II CREST award will enable the advancement of nanobiotechnology and nanogenomics, which has the potential for development of a new generation of therapies and diagnostic tools.  The three subprojects have overlapping research objectives.   All three projects will analyze genes from host as well as pathogens and use bioinformatics tools to analyze data. In addition, proteomics will be used by all projects which will study the impact of nanobiomaterials at the functional levels. All projects have common methods for analyzing nanomaterials and samples. The project relevancy and synergy are based on: 1) synthesis/characterization of nanomaterials, 2) genomic studies of host and pathogen, 3) proteomic studies of gene products in response to nanobiomaterials.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The CNBR will be a leader in the CREST goals to develop a diverse, advanced STEM workforce and should be positioned within the next 5 years to compete effectively for major support from NSF, NIH, and other state and federal agencies, as well as industry. The Phase I center support has resulted in the establishment of excellent research infrastructure to train minority students in nanobiotechnology, thus increasing the number of well-trained minority students for the scientific workforce. The Phase II CNBR will continue to increase the number of minorities in the Ph.D. program and the workforce in nanobiotechnology and nanogenomics. The center will provide leadership in new curricula development, undergraduate research opportunities and expose students to entrepreneurship. The center will continue to impact a large number of constituents in the state of Alabama by providing opportunities to high school students, hosting dignitaries, and offering seminars and workshops open to the general public. The center will work with over 15 U.S. institutions, 4 NSF centers, 6 NSF-funded programs (MSP, RISE, HBCU-UP, SBIR, C2 RII, PIRE) and will impact a large and diverse number of constituents. The center will continue to work with global partners to prepare students and faculty who are globally competitive in emerging scientific technologies.   <br/><br/>This award has been partially funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research at the National Science Foundation."

As such, this study will build on an emerging body of research about ways to broaden the representation of the African American undergraduate students in STEM fields. This type of research is highly important since studies show that racial bias weaken scientific identity in STEM by triggering and perpetuating threatening stereotypes that African Americans do not have the capacity and skills to become scientists. To that end, this project will employ a stereotype inoculation model to test whether environments characterized by majorities of marginalized group members serve to reduce the negative effects of stereotypes, protect identity development, and facilitate self-efficacy and career-related motivation. The study will compare perceptions of campus climate and academic mentoring relationships using populations of undergraduate students from two universities. It will look at specific factors that both exacerbate and buffer the negative effects of racial stereotypes, as well as the implications that they, in turn, have for the development of an adaptive science identity. <br/><br/>This project will test three conceptual models grounded in the stereotype inoculation framework. The first model will portray an erosion process whereby scientific disidentification increases as a function of racial bias and stereotype threat. A second counteractive model will test the potentially facilitative effects of racial identity on scientific self-efficacy through its spillover effect on scientific identity. The third model will examine the unconditional latent growth of implicit scientific identity, as well as the time-varying effects of students? perceptions of their mentoring relationships on the identity outcomes. Data will be collected from cohorts comprising more than 500 STEM majors attending the two universities participating in the project. Outcomes from this work will advance stereotype inoculation theory development through its innovative contextual focus on the micro- and macro-level processes that influence African American science students? STEM career attitudes. The study will also (a) provide insights into the mediating role that multiple identities, both racial and scientific identity, play in buffering these stereotypes, and (b) identify the interpersonal ingredients that comprise effective faculty-student relationships that give shape to multiculturally inclusive academic climates"

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Xavier University of Louisiana seeks to synthesize and characterize solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) phosphonium ionene in lithium-ion batteries as an alternative source of energy. Additionally, the project will provide research training to a diverse population of undergraduate students in the field of polymer science. <br/><br/>Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes have the potential to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries by eliminating the potential for catastrophic battery failure due to lithium dendrite formation in solvent-based electrolyte formulations. Because they act as both the electrode separator and the lithium ion transport medium, SPEs have the potential to enhance lithium ion transport leading to extended lifetimes of lithium ion electrochemical cells. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to develop new polyelectrolyte SPEs for lithium ion batteries that are based on phosphonium ionenes. The PI intends to employ phosphonium ionenes in lithium ion batteries for the first time and directly study the impact of localized segmental motion on lithium ion transport through SPEs. This will be achieved by synthesizing and characterizing a library of phosphonium ionenes and segmented phosphonium ionenes with variable charge density distribution and chain flexibility. The outcomes will contribute to the overall state-of-knowledge in the field by providing essential data towards understanding the role of polyelectrolyte charge density and polymer chain segmental motion on lithium ion transport in all-solid-state batteries. Further, an essential educational impact of this work includes engaging undergraduate students who are historically underrepresented in the field of polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fayetteville State University (FSU), will conduct research aimed at addressing one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our age: the escalating level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major greenhouse gas largely correlated to the combustion of fossil fuels. For the foreseeable future, it seems that the ever-growing energy demand will most likely necessitate more consumption of these indispensable sources of energy. Therefore, it is strategically important to develop technologies for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS). Currently, aqueous amine solution is the most advanced technology for carbon capture. However, the use of aqueous amine solution suffers from several significant drawbacks, including apparatus corrosion and high regeneration cost. These disadvantages can be alleviated if we graft amine into porous solid matrix instead of mixing with water. This project aims at developing novel amine-grafted porous organic polymers for efficient carbon capture. We expect two major benefits for our designed materials: one is noncorrosive. Amines are grafted inside the porous solid matrix without direct contact the apparatus. The other is energy efficient. Water has one of the highest heat capacities. It costs a lot more energy to heat aqueous solution than porous solid in a temperature swing process. The successful implementation of this proposed research will enhance our international competitiveness in carbon capture technology.<br/><br/>The scientific challenges for amine-grafted porous materials to become an economically viable technology for carbon capture are their CO2 loading, recyclability, and manufacturing costs. The better understanding of adsorption-desorption mechanisms of CO2 in amine-grafted porous materials is one of the key factors which will help us design and synthesize such materials to reach maximum CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. We propose several strategies to build porous polymeric platforms to study the structure-property correlations between amines and CO2 molecules. First, we build anchors in the porous platforms, then we use these anchors to attach amines of different lengths. The number of amines that could be incorporated is largely dependent upon the number of installed anchors; therefore, high concentration and even distribution of anchors inside the porous platforms ensure the maximum amine loading afterwards. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the CO2 adsorption-desorption mechanisms in amine-grafted porous materials at the molecular level. The knowledge generated will guide the development of such materials of high CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. The proposed research will also allow the PI to work with two to three undergraduate researchers each year over a three-year course. All of them will obtain extensive training in experimental design and implementation, data collection and analysis, results presentation and publication, etc. Such experiences will boost their competency and prepare them for graduate schools or professional workforces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project, entitled ""Understanding Pollination With Research Designed for Student participation (UPWRDS),"" aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.<br/><br/>The project objectives are to provide an opportunity for SKC faculty and students to conduct original and community relevant research that contributes to scientific knowledge, benefits education, and leverages support for continuing research opportunities. UPWRDS specifically addresses the following:  1) Does the exclusion of pollinators significantly influence huckleberry productivity on the Flathead Reservation?; and 2) Which organisms are the primary probable pollinators of huckleberry plants on the Reservation compared to the overall active pollinator community?  The work will be pursued through pollinator exclosure experiments, direct netting of pollinators observed visiting huckleberry flowers, time-constrained net sweeps, berry productivity counts, and berry seed counts. Time-lapse cellular cameras will be employed to track huckleberry phenology to assist researchers in determining the timing for data collection during flowering and peak berry ripeness."

Underrepresented minorities hold multiple identities reflecting race, ethnicity, gender, social roles, family roles, and career (e.g., scientist, engineer). These identities often conflict and, consequently, influence their choices, persistence, and success during the graduate years. This research project builds on social identity theory to understand the process of identity integration for underrepresented minority graduate students in STEM programs as they integrate into a community of practice. Identity integration is essential for lasting success. Little is known, however, about how multiple identities of underrepresented minorities in STEM conflict, intersect, and integrate as participants become productive members of a STEM community of practice.<br/><br/>Using a mixed-methods approach, this research traces the experiences of underrepresented minority graduate students in order to understand their negotiation of multiple, and often conflicting, identities as they progress through their STEM graduate programs. Pre- and post-surveys will measure changes in identity centrality and scientist-identity-interference. Multiple, regularly-scheduled interviews will assess the process of identity negotiation as graduate students become members of their disciplinary communities of practice. Social network analysis will document peer, colleague, advisor, and other support networks that URM graduate students construct as they become members of their disciplinary community of practice in STEM. Participants will be graduate students in STEM graduate programs at three PWIs. Studying these students over time will enable comparisons of identity integration, identity negotiation, and social networking. Collectively, these data will inform the development of a model for underrepresented minority STEM graduate student identity integration that identifies specific strategies for institutional support needed to promote successful assimilation into a STEM disciplinary community of practice."

This CREST-PRF research is aligned with the goals of CREST Center for Water and the Environment (CWE) in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of New Mexico. Recent trends in the oil and gas (O&G) industry show unprecedented growth such that 80% of new global demand will be met with domestic (US) supplies. This growth is due largely to technological advances (horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing) that allow for cost effective recovery of O&G from unconventional reserves. This production both requires and produces large volumes of water, both of which must be managed efficiently to insure production stability and minimize negative impacts on the broader community. The objective of this research is to understand the circumstances under which water may constrain O&G production in the future by considering how stakeholders (producers, water rights holders, regulators) respond to changes in four factors: Economics, Policy, Infrastructure, and Climate (EPIC). A decision support tool will be designed to evaluate these dynamics and to identify management strategies that will improve the resilience of these critical systems in uncertain future conditions. This work will bridge gaps between site specific analyses, technology assessments, and human behavior by addressing water management in a holistic and temporally dynamic manner.  As a result, it will generate new knowledge regarding how the system functions, what mechanisms guide stakeholder-level decisions, and how water can be optimally managed in the future at a scale that is meaningful to producers, regulators, and other water users.<br/><br/>This project will employ a novel approach that integrates spatial and big data processing and analysis, system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques, and expert elicitation to investigate the feedbacks between physical and decision-driven systems. This work will focus on the Permian Basin (NM, TX) which is estimated to represent one of the largest oil reserves globally but is also water limited and marked by periods of extended drought. Because of the rapid growth in O&G development in the region, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding how water management dynamics in the oil and gas industry will change over time and what factors will influence these relationships. The linkages between EPIC factors will be analyzed using well-level production information, water, climate, and temporal transportation network modeling. Expert knowledge will provide the basis for understanding interactions with human, stakeholder-driven systems and incorporated into an ABM. This information will improve the ability of stakeholders to identify innovative water management strategies that reduce risk and support long-term water needs in arid, energy producing regions. In addition to the extensibility of this research to other coupled energy-water systems, it provides a means to further understand implications of these dynamic systems on human health and safety in a more efficient, spatially and temporally relevant manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Savannah State University focuses on mathematical modeling for the identification of heat conductivity coefficients of two-phase materials and provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences in mathematical modeling. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Purdue University. <br/><br/>One of the central issues of the contemporary mechanics of continuous media is the problem of identification of the mechanical properties of particulate two-phase materials and flows based on the respective properties of the constituents. This project will investigate the problem of identifying one such mechanical property, namely, effective heat conductivity.  The particulate material (or suspension of particles in a fluid, such as a liquid-solid mixture) can be conceptualized as a particulate ""phase"" comprised of randomly dispersed particles throughout a continuous ""phase"". The presence of suspended particles strongly influences the overall mechanical properties. This phenomenon remains a major challenge in the field of fluid mechanics especially while estimating the effective transport coefficients, such as the heat conductivity coefficient or the viscosity coefficient, of suspensions. The long-term goal is the estimation of the effective heat conductivity coefficient for suspension by developing an in-depth mathematical model. This model will be based on a system of stochastic differential equations. This system will be recovered from the steady and unsteady heat diffusion equations by applying a method called random point approximations - also, expanding the temperature field by using a suitable stochastic functional series. In this process, the model will be fully capable of countering the problems associated with the randomness of sizes and positions of the suspended particles in a continuous media. Furthermore, it will also be able to tackle the significant issue of inhomogeneity interactions which is strongly validated by experimental data. Once developed, this model will lead to a mathematically rigorous formula for effective heat conductivity coefficient of suspension, improving Maxwell's formula for terms up to the square of concentration of the suspension. The expected outcomes will also improve our understanding of the mechanism and theory that underlies this phenomenon which will subsequently extend design options in manufacturing devices and developing processes applicable to these mechanisms, therefore opening the door to possibilities of novel processes and devices that use heat transfer and fluid flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strengthening these educational opportunities serves to increase the number of Indigenous people attaining STEM degrees and thereby diversify the STEM workforce in the United States. The project titled ""Identifying Microcystin Toxins at the Land-Sea Interface in Lummi Bay and Bellingham Bay, Washington"", aligns with these outcomes through its investigation of the water quality in the bays surrounding the Lummi Indian Reservation. The team conducting the research project is comprised of highly qualified faculty members and STEM students from Northwest Indian College (NWIC). Microcystin toxins, produced by a group of cyanobacteria known as Microcysts spp., are a recognized water contamination threat in the coastal waters of the northwestern United States that pose considerable risks to the health of humans and other animals who eat contaminated shellfish. Through this research study, the research team from NWIC systematically monitor water quality at seventeen identified sites in the bays to 1) delineate the pathways leading to microsystin contamination in Lummi and Bellingham Bays, 2) detect local ""hot spots"" for Microcystis spp. in freshwater tributaries that feed into the bays, and 3) identify environmental conditions that may be influencing toxin production. Native student interns will be engaged in every aspect of this work and through coursework and fieldwork will build their knowledge and skills as developing researchers. A rigorous monitoring system will be developed to enable regular comprehensive study of the waters around the Lummi Reservation. The potential contamination of the marine ecosystem is an issue of health, economic, and cultural significance to the Lummi people and the larger community living in the northwest coastal region. Results of the study will be shared widely with the scientific community and area citizenry. Findings will be valuable in informing resource management decisions and guidelines for safe shellfish consumption.<br/><br/>The increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) contaminating the marine food web in the coastal waters of the western United States portends the rise of serious health and economic issues related to cyanotoxin bioaccumulation in shellfish. Active monitoring of Washington's inland waters is lacking even as this area has experienced repeated events of unacceptable microcystin toxin levels in recent years. This emerging threat is addressed in the project through the development of a comprehensive monitoring system for the watersheds that feed into Lummi and Bellingham Bays on Washington's western coast to identify the sources of and environmental drivers associated with microcystin transfer from freshwater to marine environments in those waters. Faculty members will work with Native students from Northwest Indian College (NWIC) in conducting the study. Weekly water samples will be collected using Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) bags at seventeen sites predicted to be involved in or at risk for contamination. Samples will be analyzed to measure toxin levels using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Temperature, cell count, and nutrient measurements will also be recorded. Findings will be valuable in developing water quality forecasting models and resource management plans for west coast freshwater and marine environments. Results will be shared widely through publication in peer-reviewed journals and community forums, and data will be accessible to researchers and citizens. NWIC students will gain knowledge and skills in conducting research through the courses, field work, and bench work they complete while engaged in this project, while the college will build research and curricular capacity."

The Broadening Participation Research (BPR) funding opportunity provides three-year support to enhance the understanding of the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups in STEM.  Using the Fostering Identity through Transitions (FIT) model, researchers at Stony Brook University (SBU) will study cohorts of STEM and non-STEM majors to test the FIT model with STEM programs, such as the SUNY LSAMP program, that seem likely to boost STEM identity by providing STEM skills training, research mentoring, and community building opportunities that parallel the FIT model components. The research fills important scientific knowledge gaps in broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by conducting an in-depth theory-driven examination of the needed experiences that lead to engagement, retention, and overall success versus withdrawal among URM and non-URM students particularly during the first two years of college matriculation.   <br/><br/>The aim of the three-year study is to test whether the FIT model can be used to predict STEM success outcomes among students from historically underrepresented populations.  A quantitative and qualitative data intensive methodological approach of ""experience sampling"" will be employed to capture pivotal academic and social experiences that lead to college success during critcal first and second year transition.

Researchers propose to use the Performance Pyramid to develop measures that examine the effectiveness of two interventions - a combined section of college algebra and general biology that infuses math into the science curriculum and a learning community to complete mathematics projects related to biology facilitated by undergraduate peer mentors called Peer Partnership Learning (PPL) leaders.  The objectives of the learning community are to promote interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving, decrease student mathematics anxiety, encourage students to pursue STEM coursework, and increase student self-efficacy and persistence in STEM. The PPL leaders in the learning community will form supportive networks and enhance learning and personal development of student participants. The proposed study is expected to provide important insights to guide STEM education and increase the pipeline of African American students who pursue STEM graduate education and careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will use a quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design to test a multi-faceted hypothesis.  The hypothesis states that students who participate in the PPL leaders-focused learning community will demonstrate greater knowledge and skills in their STEM courses; that the conceptual elements of the performance pyramid can be quantified; that PPLs will endorse more performance pyramid support systems; that students will evaluate the learning community positively; and that participants will show higher show higher STEM retention and persistence.  Conversely, researchers postulate that the number of STEM students who switch to non-STEM disciplines will be reduced among participants in the small learning communities, and the level of math anxiety will significantly decrease upon completion of the integrated course.  The researchers will develop the course materials for intrusive learning and the survey to measure the support system in the Performance Pyramid model. They will use a combination of multivariate analyses of variance, Poisson regressions, structural equation modeling, Pearson's correlations, and descriptive statistics to analyze the research data.  They also intend to organize a faculty development workshop to encourage more STEM faculty to integrate learning communities in teaching."

Using five comprehensive, large-scale and longitudinal datasets, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin will examine differences between subgroups in intended as well as actual STEM attainment and investigate how patterns of academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to those differences. Three of the five datasets are nationally representative samples while the other two were collected in Texas and include large sample populations of Hispanic students. Separately the five datasets provide the opportunity to examine certain unique measures of academic achievement and social inclusion; collectively they provide the chance to investigate STEM trajectories at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender from the 6th grade to the end of college. Special attention will be paid to the experiences of minority girls/women and minority boys/men to gain a more comprehensive and comparative picture of contemporary patterns of inequality.<br/><br/>The analysis focuses on two research aims: 1) to examine how academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to differences in intended STEM attainment during middle and high school by gender and racial/ethnic subgroup; and 2) to examine how academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to differences in actual STEM attainment during college by gender and racial/ethnic subgroup. Statistical analyses include models using logistic and multinomial logistic regression and multi-level models to examine school or classroom level effects. Intended STEM attainment is measured using the answers to various survey questions about desired occupation and comparing the relative preferences with non-STEM occupations. Academic achievement is measured using grades, test scores and course-taking. Social inclusion is measured using answers to questions about perceived peer and teacher support and perceived equitable treatment. The framework of the study is grounded in theories of intersectionality that focus on the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity and the multiple jeopardy that may apply when one is a member of two different groups with relatively lower status. This analysis uses large-scale data to explicitly address the experiences of different groups and to uncover patterns that may affirm this jeopardy or identify instances of resiliency when students succeed in educational environments.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the project is to broaden STEM participation by contributing new knowledge about the factors that promote or impede the retention and attainment of women and minority youth in STEM fields. Findings will be presented at academic and policy-related conferences, published in top-tier peer-reviewed journals in education and sociology, and distributed through press releases to local and national media outlets to reach a broad public audience. The research team will also use their extant relationships with national teacher professional development programs to communicate research findings to key audiences of primary and secondary teachers across the country. Additionally, the project is working to broaden participation through the recruitment and training of women and minority doctoral students in the fields of STEM education and sociology. The diverse perspectives of these students, coupled with the rigorous analytical training they will receive, are critical for preparing future generations of academic researchers to study STEM equality."

The research has the potential of improving the linear and nonlinear solvers for the conventional Finite Difference and Finite Element methods for poroelastic models in various applications. As an example, the developed numerical algorithms can be used in simulating energy storage in subsurface, which requires large-scale numerical computations; furthermore, the developed numerical methods can be applied to simulate a brain swelling model and therefore quantify brain edema assessment.

Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. This study extends prior theoretical and empirical work on STEM learning and STEM learning environments into community college classrooms in developmental mathematics.  Developmental math courses are a major academic gatekeeper for adequately preparing students for the work force, yet many students in community colleges fail to reach college-ready math proficiency even with remediation through developmental curricula.  To address this need, this study will examine the impact of a brief but promising psychological intervention designed to enhance student motivation and course learning outcomes in developmental math.  The investigators hypothesize that this intervention will lead to increased perceptions of interest and performance in mathematics, which in turn will, in the short term, result in improved performance (increased course pass rates) and persistence (decreased dropout rates) of students enrolled in the community college developmental math courses that are the focus of this study. Ultimately, the investigators anticipate the foundational evidence generated by this study will provide practitioners with the information necessary to optimize interventions based on individual differences and contextual factors (practical import), and have the potential to contribute to the development of theories about for whom and why interventions work (theoretical important).<br/><br/>Specifically, this study is designed to provide evidence of the efficacy and effectiveness of an expectancy value intervention, combining growth mindset and utility value components.  Researchers at the University of Virginia and Valencia Community College (located in Orange and Osceola Counties, Florida) will collaborate on a series of trials of one of three treatment conditions (growth mindset only, utility value only, combined growth mindset and utility value) and a 'business as usual' control condition. Intervention trials will be contained within a semester, with follow-ups coming from administrative data sets. At the end of the three-year intervention cycle nine separate cohorts of students (n=5,600) will have participated in the study, nested within class sections (n=280), nested within teachers (n=40) at Valencia Community College. Of particular interest are the individual- and contextual- (classroom and teacher) level factors which might moderate or mediate the effects of the expectancy-value intervention.  Accordingly, study participants will be randomly assigned to treatment conditions at the classroom level, enabling the investigators to explore whether the intervention is more effective in some classrooms and/or with some teachers than others.  Primary data to explore mediating and moderating factors will be collected via administration of a self-report student motivation questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and to-be-developed instruments to survey students' perceptions of the classroom learning context and teachers' beliefs about learning and teaching practices in mathematics. Student demographic and performance data will be obtained from administrative records; additionally, instructors will be asked to provide classroom-level student performance data. Complementary qualitative data will be collected from students and teachers via separate student and teacher focus groups, individual student interviews, and think-aloud protocols elaborating on the student motivation questionnaire. Analyses of these data may have potentially important implications regarding the benefits of explicit consideration of contexts when developing theories of psychological interventions in education. Additionally, the study is designed to enable investigators to replicate the intervention across multiple cohorts (testing for consistency), and to follow students longitudinally (exploring potential intervention effects on more distal outcomes, e.g., persistence towards degree completion).  The investigators hypothesize the expectancy-value intervention will be both resource-efficient and practically useful - capable of being delivered to students as online learning modules amenable to widespread dissemination across large sets of classrooms and institutions.  Following completion of the study, (de-identified) study data will be made available to other researchers."

The Mokauea fishpond is located on Mokauea island of the Kalihi ahupua'a just off the southern coastline of O'ahu. In the early 1900's, this region was the site of over forty fishponds, producing nearly one ton of fish per year. Currently, the Mokauea fishpond is not functional, even though the basic water quality parameters are within acceptable ranges for fish production. This investigation aims to understand the workings of the Mokauea fishpond and other Hawaiian fishponds. The research will utilize tools from statistics and applied mathematics, and, just as importantly, will integrate the ancient knowledge from Native Hawaiian cultural and fishpond practitioners. The results of the study will provide insights into traditional Native Hawaiian sustainable aquaculture practices, viewed from the lenses of Western scientific and mathematical language. Further, findings will contribute information valuable to addressing the increasingly important issue of sustainable food production. <br/><br/>To achieve the goals of this investigation, data relating to the physical attributes of the Mokauea pond will be collected over a year-long monitoring study. These data will be analyzed using mathematical modeling software to develop models of the dynamic relationships between water temperature and circulation patterns at play in the fishpond. The model for the temperature profile will be drawn based on the energy balance principle, while the water circulation model will be based on the shallow water circulation model (Saint Venant equations).

Consequently, this project can contribute to building a diverse STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The project will examine how research opportunities may increase student engagement, critical thinking skills, student retention and graduation, and transfer into a baccalaureate STEM program. The project includes three coordinated interventions: 1) integrating course-based research into eight STEM gateway courses; 2) supporting independent student-driven research experiences; and 3) creating a summer research academy. These interventions will incorporate student-driven research into the curriculum, enhancing the traditional community college learning experience. The project will assess the impact of research experiences by comparing baseline and post-intervention populations using the Critical-Thinking Assessment Test instrument. In each of the three interventions, the project will use this instrument to determine critical thinking skills at the beginning and completion of the interventions. Students will also be tracked to examine retention in the major. Finally, data will be collected on student performance including grades, enrollment in STEM courses, and graduation and transfer rates. To examine the impact of CURES, a comparison will be made between students who participate in the CURES and baseline data for STEM majors. Students in the academic year research projects and research academy will be compared to students who did not participate, as well as to the college's baseline data.

Undergraduate students will be involved in the project and a new course in high performance computing will be developed. <br/><br/>In oil recovery, carbon dioxide sequestration, or monitoring and remediation of aquifer contamination, it is often required to forecast quantities such as the fraction of oil in the produced fluid, carbon dioxide concentration, or concentration of contaminants, using subsurface fluid flow models with limited data. In this work, a Bayesian framework on Graphics Processing Units for forecasting flows will be employed. The main objectives of the project are to: expand the subsurface characterization in an existing Bayesian framework that employs a flow simulator on GPUs; improve experimental data fitting using the Bayesian statistical framework; and extend the improved framework to include a three-dimensional flow simulator on GPUs. To improve the characterization, a huff-puff technique will be employed, which consists of injecting a tracer for a short period of time into the subsurface during the huff phase, and monitoring the tracer during the puff phase.  Additionally, an ensemble Kalman filter for integrating permeability and porosity data at different spatial scales for reconstructing fine-scale spatial distributions of permeability and porosity will be used. Through collaboration with industry, the proposed Bayesian framework can be used to detect contaminants in water aquifers equipped with sensors."

First-year graduate students will be randomly assigned to a control condition or to either a standard or contingent affirmation intervention. The standard affirmation involves an empirically-validated writing exercise that has participants reflect on their important values. The newly-developed contingent affirmation has participants explicitly link their values to their long-term educational goals. A smartphone application will be used to provide periodic booster interventions and collect ongoing ecological momentary assessment data on students' lived experiences. This method will provide needed psychological and behavioral data to chronicle long-term indicators of stress that may contribute to student attrition from STEM doctoral programs. Results will provide a window into the psychological and performance trajectories of STEM graduate students and the factors that predict attrition and retention, including the effectiveness of affirmation interventions in this population.

The researchers hypothesize students experiencing greater success in introductory biology by constructing concept maps and using them as an active learning tool will more likely be retained as a STEM major. The impact of concept mapping will be measured by investigating the correlations among course grades in two biology courses, mapping skill, ability to think big, motivation, and retention rates. The conceptual framework for the proposed project incorporates theories that support the efficacy of purposely creating an active learning environment that centers on the use of concept learning maps. The research has the potential to transform the biology learning environment from teacher-centered to student-centered with a focus on meaningful learning thereby increasing retention. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a mixed-methods approach involving four classes and 30-40 faculty to answer two research questions: (1) What are the measurable impacts of using concept maps on metacognition and motivation among underrepresented students in introductory biology courses. (2) What are the correlations among course grades, mapping skill, metacognition, and motivation as well as retention and completion rates in upper-level biology courses?  They will collect quantitative data using two survey instruments and qualitative data using classroom observations of concept mapping and semi-structured interviews with faculty. The research findings are expected to yield insights to reverse the attrition in introductory gatekeeper biology courses for STEM majors and, ultimately, provide an alternative model for improving overall student success. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions."

The University of Delaware (UD) contributes to broadening the participation of women in the academy through a series of initiatives that focus on leadership development, promotion of mid-career women in STEM, development of transparent policies for faculty recruitment, retention and promotion as well as enhanced data collection on faculty and a focus on improving the climate for women faculty from underrepresented groups. Women Faculty To Leadership, the W2L program reframes campus leadership training to the top -  the Office of the Provost with faculty.  Campus leaders will partner with women faculty to develop strategies to lower the barriers to advancement.  The data collection, through system climate studies and faculty exit interviews, will enhance the institutional knowledge of the issues that faculty encounter, particularly STEM women of color, so that the institution may develop plans for improvement.<br/><br/>The University of Delaware proposes a clear analytical framework that, in its simplicity, may have tremendous impact on future thinking and action.  They propose a multi-level approach, the hourglass, that shows how to link the upper level administrative strategies with grassroots strategies proposed by faculty.  The middle area is a space where department chairs may connect the upper and lower portions to create more balance in the system.  This is the underlying rationale for the programming that composes the W2L activity and other aspects of the project.  Prior research on sources of barriers for advancing women in STEM identifies department chairs and heads as key players in shaping the work climate, specifically the microclimate of the department, at colleges and universities that may slow women's progress.  Another example is that UD will create a mentoring academy for department chairs to share current research on how to improve departmental climate.  W2L's regional conference will help to disseminate to a national audience findings from this project related to broadening participation of women in academic STEM. The resulting a partnership of women faculty of color and university leadership will serve as a model for academia in general to become a more inclusive environment."

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Tuskegee University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to study  fundamental characteristics of jet instability and its potential alteration using an ultra-frequency micro-fluidic actuation technique called resonance enhanced microjets (REM). Instability modification, using REM, has potential applications in augmentation of air-fuel mixing in supersonic flow and control of jet noise. Undergraduate students will gain research experience in experimental fluid mechanics. A course in experimental fluid mechanics that includes topics such as digital data acquisition, random data analysis and gas dynamics will be developed.<br/><br/>This project includes the design and fabrication of REM in the ultra-frequency range (above 20 kHz) and the study of their interaction and impact on shear layer dynamics of an air jet in free and cross-flow configuration. The jet properties will be studied using unsteady intrusive probes as well as non-intrusive techniques such as laser based microschlieren and planar scattering imaging. The proposed micro-actuation scheme is expected to modify inherent instabilities of a jet, exciting the most unstable modes and generating high frequency three dimensional vorticities for enhanced entrainment and diffusion. The actuators proposed here can produce high momentum pulsed disturbances up to 50 kHz generating instabilities every 20 microseconds in the cross-flow jet. Since such a time scale is very close to the mixing time of a high-speed combustor, this approach is expected to potentially enhance air-fuel mixing in supersonic flows. Fundamental studies on such a tailored jet flowfield will be useful for designing high-speed combustors with improved air-fuel mixing and flame stability."

It is also important to understand which student subsets, such as those who are historically underrepresented minorities (URM), succeed in HBCUs at the highest rates. As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, the number of students who are URMs and receiving undergraduate and advanced degrees in STEM is, by all accounts, disproportionately low.  This is also true of students who are educated at our nation's HBCUs, with a select group of students that are successfully completing STEM undergraduate and doctoral degrees.  In order to engage all U.S. citizens in our nation's effort to advance STEM education and the scientific enterprise, we must also understand what variables are enhancing the pathways for student success.

This AGEP Alliance model represents a state system approach to recruiting and training URM postdoctoral fellows and transitioning them into tenure-track faculty positions.  In addition to providing professional development and mentoring for a group of 16 URM postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty, this AGEP Alliance also addresses institutional URM faculty hiring and advancement policies and practices.  This AGEP Alliance model work is through partnerships between the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Salisbury University, Towson University, the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), and the University of Maryland at Baltimore.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of URM graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. While this Alliance is primarily funded by the AGEP program, additional support has been provided by the NSF INCLUDES program, which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change. The ADVANCE program also provided support for this AGEP Alliance model work, and the ADVANCE program embraces three goals that are relevant to this Alliance model's development, implementation and testing: To develop systemic approaches to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers; to develop innovative and sustainable ways to promote gender equity that involve both men and women in the STEM academic workforce; and to contribute to the research knowledge base on gender equity and the intersection of gender and other social identities in STEM academic careers.<br/><br/>As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. This AGEP Alliance's state system approach is advancing a model to improve the success of URM early career biomedical sciences faculty, which ultimately leads to improved academic mentorship for URM undergraduate students in STEM and innovative biological science research to benefit our nation's security, economic progress and prosperity.<br/><br/>The integrated research component, led by UMCP's KerryAnn O'Meara examines how the intersectionality of race, ethnicity and gender shape the experiences of candidates for assistant professorships, and the evaluation of those candidates by reviewers.  Institutional faculty hiring practices, processes and procedures are also being studied to better understand how they advantage or disadvantage some candidates over others.<br/><br/>This AGEP Alliance state system model is engaging institutional leadership and external advisory boards, which will provide feedback to the team and suggest adjustments to model development, implementation and testing, as well as efforts for institutional transformation and sustainability.  Staff at Westat will provide formative and summative evaluations.

However, while the US moves toward minority-majority status, that demographic change is not reflected in the number of graduate degrees being awarded to underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science and engineering. This underrepresentation of such a large portion of the US population in STEM graduate programs must be addressed, and supporting URM students in their pursuit of advanced degrees is a critical piece. Working in pursuit of this critical piece, the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), a part of the University of California Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program, will offer 12 incoming LSAMP PhD students substantial fellowships and degree completion support. LSAMP assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP BD Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to ""integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.""  For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  UCSB is uniquely positioned in this alliance as it has also recently become a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), and as such is the first in the Association of American Universities (AAU) to reach HSI status, putting UCSB on a short list of prominent research-intensive institutions serving a large number of Hispanic students. The BD project at UCSB seeks to seed a shift in the institutional culture by introducing holistic selection criteria and faculty mentoring resources, and raising the visibility of motivated and talented URM STEM PhD trainees and alumni thereby encouraging future generations of underrepresented students. Similarly, the proposed UCSB-BD program intends to increase the number of URM students in STEM who successfully complete a doctoral program at UCSB and successfully transition into the STEM workforce with the highest level of academic achievement. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/>There remains a growing demand in the United States for a highly trained and diverse STEM workforce to maintain US intellectual and economic competitiveness in the global market. However, while the US moves toward minority-majority status, that demographic change is not reflected in the number of graduate degrees being awarded to underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. In fact, in 2014, URMs represented only 13% of the earned doctorates in science and engineering. Having a diverse set of problem-solvers becomes paramount to sustaining the nation's scientific excellence and solving important societal needs. The current underrepresentation of such a large portion of the US population in STEM graduate programs must be addressed. Supporting URM students in their pursuit of advanced degrees is crucial. UCSB will support 12 PhD students through the BD program within the University of California LSAMP.  The UCSB-BD program seeks to increase the diversity and inclusion of our STEM workforce through a concerted campus-wide effort and an evidence-based program designed to identify and foster the development of a cohort of alumni as PhD-trained science and engineering leaders. <br/><br/>The UCSB-BD program will build on existing infrastructure, develop new strategies and leverage networks, campus, state, and nation-wide, to expand the body of knowledge around recruiting, training and retaining a diverse population of PhD-trained scientists and engineers. The BD program at UCSB will do this by providing a strong community of mentors and an extensive academic and professional preparation program that offers BD Fellows access to the tools and community interaction that will foster success in their graduate programs and beyond. With a focus on affirming values, nurturing a sense of belonging, and mentoring through key transition points, the UCSB-BD program will ensure a timely completion of the PhD and a confident transition into STEM careers in academia, government and industry. As UCSB strives to promote a nurturing environment for our STEM PhD trainees, hosting a BD program is an important step toward building more robust and inclusive recruitment and retention strategies for broadening participation. Additionally, in order to better understand the important factors in the trajectory of success for those underrepresented in science and engineering seeking and progressing though advanced degrees, a rigorous evaluation plan and tracking strategy will be employed and results shared across the California LSAMP alliance and national networks."

Over the past two decades, Team Science based research has become increasingly central in scientific discovery.  Scientific research can be enhanced when informed by diverse points of view and diverse (and thus often broader) research questions.  Diversity on teams is known to have positive effects on creativity, innovation, and productivity.  Diversity in science and in scientific teams helps ensure scientific questions and research align with social needs and benefits.  The CREDITS project will forge collaborative relationships and partnerships among Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) systems.  The program includes three interrelated activities: 1) Annual team science leadership and team formation retreats; 2) Team science and institutional change training/seminar for UC and CSU leadership; and 3) Evaluation and research that will increase our knowledge about team science and diversity and inform CREDITS programming.  <br/><br/>The CREDITS project links theories about team science in academic STEM careers with theories about barriers to participation and advancement in STEM for women and underrepresented minorities.  The benefits of team science to science innovation and individual research careers is becoming well-known, but less is known about gender and science teams, and there has been no explicit research to date on racial-ethnic diversity and team science.  CREDITS will begin to study these issues, particularly asking questions about barriers to diverse participation on science teams, how diversity shapes the formation of science teams, and how diversity and team science is implicated in promotion and tenure practices and policies at a variety of institutional types.  The CREDITS project will also build the networks of the faculty participating in the workshops which is expected to affect their individual professional outcomes.  Women and underrepresented minority scientists are less likely to participate in team science collaborations, and their participation in these networks develops later in their careers."

The programs combine research and career mentorship from researchers at the OTS field sites, along with home mentors from the students' LSAMP institutions, to ensure the integration of the experience into the student's academic career. OTS will enhance the programs by 1) recruiting students from tribal, HBCUs, and other small two-year LSAMP-affiliated institutions where application and participation rates have been lowest, 2) establishing a cultural component to the program through the addition of cultural mentors and other visiting scholars, 3) initiating science communication and outreach training for students in both programs, and 4) providing the opportunity for students to leverage their research accomplishments through travel awards to attend scientific conferences. Finally, OTS will disseminate the students' achievements through the sponsorship of a symposium and the publication of an anthology. These efforts will showcase the rich experiences and successes LSAMP students have shared as well as expand the impact of the program by communicating strategies, successes, and best practices. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of the OTS LSAMP program is to provide hands-on, mentored-research experiences to undergraduate students from groups most underrepresented in the sciences. Specifically, OTS will continue to invite Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanic American, and African American students to participate in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) at the La Selva Research Station in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowland rainforest or the Las Cruces Research Station in southern Costa Rica (students self-select their preferred site). The scientific objectives of the LSAMP REU programs at Las Cruces and La Selva are to: 1) stimulate LSAMP students to pursue careers in biology and the environmental sciences; 2) establish a clear understanding of the scientific method; 3) clarify the importance of biological ecosystems, ecology as a science, and the role of science in conservation; and 4) increase student awareness of the ethical context of research in a local, regional as well as international setting. The Las Cruces and La Selva programs are eight-weeks in length and have evolved to provide LSAMP students with an ideal nurturing environment and scientific community for field research in tropical ecology. Both programs foster daily interactions among students and their researcher mentors. Both empower the students with ownership of their research projects and the confidence to live and work as scientists. In addition, through interactions with Costa Rican researchers, indigenous leaders, and community members, LSAMP students are exposed to different cultural and societal customs and norms as well as international perspectives. Most importantly, these programs require careful assembly of the students' on-campus mentors/faculty advisors who participate in the program and work with the students long after the summer program is over. Frequently, home mentors encourage the students to continue to present their work and even improve upon it during the school year. The active interaction of both research and on-campus mentors on the students' educational and career pathways can be significant and often have been transformational. An alumni survey of the decade-long program conducted in 2015 revealed that, as a direct result of the students' summer experience, 72% of the students gave an oral or poster presentation at a scientific conference, 19% co-authored a paper submitted to a scientific journal, and 13% co-authored a paper that was published in a scientific journal. The survey further documented that 24% had completed a two-year Associate's degree, 67% had completed a four-year a Bachelor's degree, 16% had completed a Master's degree, and 2% had completed a PhD., while two-thirds of alumni were still pursuing degrees in the life sciences or geosciences at the bachelor's level (24%), master's level (24%) or doctoral level (20%). Through the continuation of the OTS program, most-at-risk LSAMP students are receiving the knowledge, skills, confidence, desire, and understanding to build their aspirations into baccalaureate degrees in a STEM field, obtain graduate-level STEM degrees, and/or establish their careers in the biological or environmental sciences."

Additionally, all are pioneering new approaches to STEM education by incorporating traditional cultural values, student research opportunities, and community development projects into their degree programs.  However, few people working outside of the tribal colleges are aware of these accomplishments. Because tribal colleges represent a relatively young educational movement, many Americans do not know they exist. Even those familiar with the colleges are often surprised by the diversity and sophistication of their rapidly expanding STEM programs.

This award to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to advance the fundamental understanding of robustness as a performance indicator for geotechnical infrastructures and establish an informed decision support framework for robust management of earthen levees against multiple hazards. The research will be integrated into geotechnical engineering courses at UDC.<br/><br/>The project will develop a robust management methodology to address the infrastructure robustness under multiple hazards and advance the state-of-practice in adaptive management of geotechnical infrastructures. The cornerstones of the robust management methodology are three tightly integrated concepts: engineering robustness against multiple hazards, Bayesian inference, and multi-objective based decision-support. Firstly, an original quantitative robustness metric will be formulated for assessing the capability of earthen levees to withstand hazard events such as floods and earthquakes. Then a novel probabilistic framework will be established for robustness and reliability assessment of earthen levees. Finally, an intelligent decision support framework will be created to turn numerical simulation results and performance data into robust management capability. The research is expected to fill a knowledge gap in geotechnical engineering by transforming the robustness concept into an effective decision support tool for geotechnical infrastructure management. The results of the research will lead to an innovative solution for resilient geotechnical infrastructures in the face of uncertainty, which can protect the public and benefit society through safer engineering practice for risk reduction and mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to Norfolk State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project will focus on constructing a mathematical model to investigate the role of social behavior in the transmission dynamics of HIV epidemics.  The outcomes of this work can inform public health officials when analyzing and determining the impact of social behavior in the transmission of HIV epidemics. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Norfolk State University.<br/><br/>This project will focus on developing mathematical models, in the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the role of risky behavior on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  Studies have established a strong correlation between risky behavior and the acquisition of HIV infection.  Some of these behaviors are associated with substance abuse. Although it is understood that there are different degrees or stages of substance abuse, the impact of such heterogeneity on the overall disease transmission process has not been rigorously studied.  This project will investigate these dynamics and their role in the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  To achieve this objective, new realistic mathematical models, which incorporate the essential features of HIV disease as well as the dynamics of relevant risky behaviors, will be developed.  These models, which will be rigorously analyzed using techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems, such as asymptotic stability and bifurcation theory, to gain insights into their dynamical features, will be parametrized using available relevant public health and demographic data. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, using suitable sampling techniques such as Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients, will be carried out on the parameters of the models to assess the impact of uncertainty in the estimates of the parameter values used in the simulations on the overall simulation results obtained, and determine the most important parameters that drive the disease transmission process."

Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research, which connects students to culturally and geographically relevant research, is an important step in engaging students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>Dine' College will implement several new degrees or certificates in relevant STEM fields.  These are:  a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental science (the college currently offers an AS degree, which would be expanded with upper division coursework and additional faculty); Bachelor of Arts degrees in math and science secondary education; an Associate of Science degree in pre-engineering; and certification programs in natural resources/GIS and in computer technology.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is found in the expertise of the key leaders, the impressive faculty credentials that will be brought to bear on the degree and program development, and the alignment of the project goals with STEM workforce opportunities and the goals of the nation and the college.  Additionally, the project evaluation plan will provide insight into effective strategies for community colleges that seek to strengthen instructional capacity in STEM."

Participation by UREM students in the physical sciences has never matched their representation in the population and the fraction of doctoral degrees earned by UREM students is dramatically less than the fraction of bachelor degrees earned by the same groups. This disparity is specifically salient because these students constitute a significant, growing, and essentially untapped source of domestic scientific talent. To erase this gap, the IGEN Alliance proposes an innovative strategy to institutionalize inclusive, evidence-based practices for selecting and training a diverse, innovative, and globally competitive scientific workforce. The primary partners in the IGEN Alliance are the American Physical Society, American Chemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Astronomical Society, and Materials Research Society. These societies are uniquely positioned to lead efforts in the physical sciences that empower faculty members to reform and improve their graduate education practices. Together, our partners represent a constellation of organizations and individuals from disciplinary societies representing UREM students, major national laboratories, prominent industries, and leading social science researchers, who can address systemic issues that inhibit success of underrepresented students in attaining doctoral degrees - degrees that enable them to advance science and provide technological innovations for the United States.<br/><br/>To achieve our participation and completion goals, our Alliance is 1) catalyzing UREM graduate enrollment through new application and holistic review processes championed by the professional societies in each discipline, 2) sustaining such growth by propagating programs that create more inclusive graduate education environments, and 3) improving student mentoring through critical transitions from undergraduate experiences, graduate school, and finally into the workforce. Collectively defined metrics are being used to ensure program components are supporting progress towards the Alliance's goals. The IGEN backbone organization is building infrastructure, processes, communications, and networks that support the widespread adoption of effective inclusive practices in graduate STEM education. The Alliance's Research and Inclusive Practices Hubs support leadership development, both in graduate education research and inclusive graduate education practice and professional development. Each IGEN Alliance component is designed with two principles in mind: national-scale impact and long-term sustainability. While IGEN is beginning its work in the physical sciences, expansion is being actively pursued through dialog with other disciplines including engineering, computer science, biological sciences, and mathematics. Professional societies have the unique opportunity to lead as advocates for commonly held values, as centralized sources for effective practice, and as organizations that can sustain long-term initiatives. The leadership of each society is committed to this challenge and is strategically aligning to this NSF INCLUDES Alliance's vision of achieving equity for underrepresented groups in doctoral degree attainment. <br/><br/>This NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. This NSF INCLUDES Alliance is also funded by the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program, which targets increasing the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This AGEP Alliance model represents a state system approach to recruiting and training URM postdoctoral fellows and transitioning them into tenure-track faculty positions.  In addition to providing professional development and mentoring for a group of 16 URM postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty, this AGEP Alliance also addresses institutional URM faculty hiring and advancement policies and practices.  This AGEP Alliance model work is through partnerships between the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Salisbury University, Towson University, the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), and the University of Maryland at Baltimore.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of URM graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. While this Alliance is primarily funded by the AGEP program, additional support has been provided by the NSF INCLUDES program, which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change. The ADVANCE program also provided support for this AGEP Alliance model work, and the ADVANCE program embraces three goals that are relevant to this Alliance model's development, implementation and testing: To develop systemic approaches to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers; to develop innovative and sustainable ways to promote gender equity that involve both men and women in the STEM academic workforce; and to contribute to the research knowledge base on gender equity and the intersection of gender and other social identities in STEM academic careers.<br/><br/>As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. This AGEP Alliance's state system approach is advancing a model to improve the success of URM early career biomedical sciences faculty, which ultimately leads to improved academic mentorship for URM undergraduate students in STEM and innovative biological science research to benefit our nation's security, economic progress and prosperity.<br/><br/>The integrated research component, led by UMCP's KerryAnn O'Meara examines how the intersectionality of race, ethnicity and gender shape the experiences of candidates for assistant professorships, and the evaluation of those candidates by reviewers.  Institutional faculty hiring practices, processes and procedures are also being studied to better understand how they advantage or disadvantage some candidates over others.<br/><br/>This AGEP Alliance state system model is engaging institutional leadership and external advisory boards, which will provide feedback to the team and suggest adjustments to model development, implementation and testing, as well as efforts for institutional transformation and sustainability.  Staff at Westat will provide formative and summative evaluations.  The dissemination plan includes article submissions to peer-reviewed social science, academic career diversity, and disciplinary education and research journals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TCUP's funding of projects that address these goals expands opportunities for Native people to pursue challenging degrees and rewarding careers in STEM, to conduct research studies on culturally significant topics, and fosters generational appreciation for STEM education. In alignment with TCUP's goals, Northwest Indian College's (NWIC) project ""From Mountain to Sea: A Culturally Relevant Summer Science Program at the Salish Sea Research Center (SSRC)"" engages undergraduate students with research and faculty mentors in community-relevant scientific research related to water quality for the waters surrounding the Lummi Reservation in northwestern Washington state, and its impacts on food sovereignty. The project links academic-year STEM curricula from NWIC's Bachelor of Native Environmental Science degree (BSNES) with culturally relevant research at the SSRC, developing students' expertise and confidence as researchers, while generating knowledge important to the local community and broader society about harmful algae blooms (HABs). Participation in the project prepares students for service in natural resources leadership roles and/or to pursue a STEM graduate degree. Research findings will be widely disseminated to community stakeholders and to the professional community through presentations at conferences and publications. An institutional outcome of this project will be the development of a sustainable program that engages Indigenous knowledge and scientific learning, while supporting students in earning a BSNES degree at NWIC.<br/><br/>Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are a concern for the Coast Salish People due to the effects of HABs on water quality and shellfish, a culturally important food source for many American Indian tribes living in the Pacific northwest. Anthropogenic nutrients from industry and agriculture, coupled with climate change effects like rising temperatures and recurrent drought events, increase the likelihood for longer duration and more frequent HABs. The Natural Resources Department of the Lummi Nation and the Salish Sea Research Center of Northwest Indian College are actively partnered in studies of HABs, which can cause serious public health and economic issues when HAB toxins rise to dangerous levels in shellfish. This project engages NWIC undergraduate students in the research partnership as summer interns conducting culturally-relevant studies of HABs in the waters surrounding the Lummi Nation. Student interns will disseminate their findings through publications and presentations in community and professional forums. Participation in the project prepares NWIC's STEM students to enter environmental science professions and/or matriculation to graduate school in environmental STEM disciplines.

WPI data analysis indicates that STEM faculty gender equity issues are attributable to implicit biases and a ""foggy climate,"" a research-based metaphor for ambiguity in promotion processes, in valuing of different types of work, and in work distribution that disadvantages women.  The process and outcomes of this work will be disseminated to multiple audiences who can be change agents at other institutions, including STEM Deans and Chief Academic Officers in the Association of Independent Technological Universities, and through WPI's Institute on Project-Based Learning which reaches more than one hundred educators at dozens of other institutions.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to advance knowledge by serving as a case study of Boyer-inspired promotion reform aimed at addressing gender inequity and marginalization of intersectional identities at WPI.  WPI is an institution that integrates project-based learning into their undergraduate curriculum which is a factor that may impact STEM faculty equity issues in unique ways that this project will help to identify and understand.  For example, faculty promotion systems are a perceived barrier for other institutions interested in increasing the use of project-based and community-engaged learning. A combination of formative and summative evaluation, with quantitative and qualitative methods, will determine the extent to which interventions are effective and why. Overall, the project will provide increased knowledge regarding mechanisms to decrease systemic biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The AMP-UP project will result in a matrix structure with cross-functional teams to address change initiatives.  This model helps to ensure the involvement of diverse perspectives as well as enhance organizational knowledge building and transfer within the organization.  This is overlaid with the LEAN Continuous Improvement (CI) model which supports the development of a culture of improvement through reflective self-study, data gathering and analysis, and strategic interventions.  The three initiative areas (Research and Scholarship, Unit Climate, and Dual Career) will be the column backbone of the AMP-UP program, featuring cross-functional teams of administrators, faculty, and staff.  One of the benefits of this model is that programming is dynamic and tailored rather than static and prescriptive, thereby increasing acceptance and sustainability.

Framed using theories of motivation, self-efficacy, and attribution, the project is grounded by research documenting that an engaging classroom environment and active learning improve student performance. The researchers are interested particularly in exploring how exposure to mathematics instruction models can modify existing psychosocial processes among students in the gate-keeper math courses. The project will contribute to the current knowledge by producing empirical evidence of an intervention that can mitigate a recurring barrier to underrepresented minority student persistence in STEM, i.e., mastery of gatekeeper mathematics courses.  <br/><br/>The researchers will test two hypotheses: implementing the Math Emporium and SCALE-UP models in pre-calculus and trigonometry courses will positively impact students' attitudes, self-efficacy, and academic performance, and there is a causal relationship among these variables. The project will employ a mixed-method research design and sequential approach to answer the research questions and include approximately 120 treatment subjects and 120 control subjects.  The qualitative phase of the project aims to reveal underlying factors that influence cognitive and affective processes and expand theory and current knowledge of practices that have been demonstrated to improve STEM education and persistence. A pre-post-test design will be used to determine students' incoming attitudes and beliefs and the extent to which these change over time in related gate-keeper mathematics courses. The researchers will use a comparison group to document the magnitude of the effect of the intervention on student attitudes, self-efficacy, effort and course outcomes and employ descriptive statistics to characterize categorical and numerical variables. Focus group sessions will be transcribed and coded for significant statements and emergent themes, and textual and categorical data analysis will be conducted using text mining tools.

BGSU will develop the ALLIES project which adapts evidence-based strategies from two ADVANCE-IT projects to build faculty allies within departments and inclusive leaders across the university: North Dakota State University's ""Advocates & Allies"" program and Florida International University's ""Deep Change"" program.  The ALLIES project will focus on how administrators and faculty allies can work collaboratively to reduce biases and transform institutional policies and practices. Department allies ensure equitable review of job candidates and evaluation of faculty, serve as mentors to support colleagues' careers, and intervene when bias emerges. Inclusive leaders advocate for faculty and ensure policies and practices produce an equitable workplace. The long-term goal of the project is to make allyship and inclusive leadership the expectation and norm at BGSU.  <br/><br/>Inclusion, intersectionality, and interconnections--the 3 I's--serve as the unifying theme of all BGSU ALLIES programming. The BGSU ALLIES model is innovative because it integrates the concepts of allyship--rooted in the activities of faculty colleagues within departmental cultures--and inclusive leadership--the domain of department chairs, deans and other senior administrators--into a single unified program of institutional transformation. This approach is directed both top-down and bottom-up, as neither is likely to be effective alone.  The BGSU ALLIES project has four objectives: 1) revise institutional policies and processes to make allyship and inclusive leadership the expectation for faculty and administrators, 2) design training materials, workshops, and online modules to train and develop departmental allies and inclusive leaders, 3) deploy new data collection processes for better tracking of faculty careers, and 4) disseminate training materials and best practices to other institutions through a strategic communication plan and a regional conference at BGSU. Most research on ally building in higher education settings focus on students therefore this project will contribute important new information about faculty and administrator allies to that literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intervention incorporates small in-class collaborative projects to inspire students' interest in learning new theory and to train students in the design process. The researchers will leverage the Robotics Clinics learning environment at Bowie State to understand why the intervention is effective and to generalize the innovative teaching practice to the broader STEM education community, particularly minority serving institutions. <br/><br/>The researchers propose to investigate two research questions in two phases. The research questions are what are the learning characteristics of minority freshmen in STEM, and how do various features in collaborative learning and group dynamics influence the development of efficacy. In the first phase, the investigators will collect and analyze survey data of students enrolled in the Robotics Clinic freshman seminar courses using a social constructivist framework. They will then conduct a learner and contextual analysis to study the influences of learner characteristics and group differences. In the second phase, the investigators will use the results of the first phase to design and test the effectiveness of the evidence-based instructional system in fostering self-efficacy. The researchers will assess the impact of the project on faculty through surveys, focus groups, and self-reported anecdotes. The project is expected to produce a measure to evaluate the developmental impacts of the collaborative learning strategy on learning outcomes, to articulate an effective instructional system that integrates community inquiry, and to indirectly enhance the training of STEM faculty in educational research."

Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals.   The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees.  For those students entering the STEM workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology.<br/> <br/>The overall goal of this project is to model how and why TCUP supported innovations, such as early exposure to research, have contributed to the enhancements of teaching and learning among STEM students in the tribal college.  This proposal builds on prior research conducted in relation to the two TCUP projects conducted at Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC) over the last ten years and addresses key issues concerning tribal college student retention and completion in STEM fields. One of the major findings of the past ten years of TCUP capacity building at the college is that students who are involved with research at the two-year college tend to remain engaged longer in the educational process. The research projects have served as a tool to keep students involved in STEM fields and helped them choose STEM areas for degrees and for workforce placement. The first objective of this work is to increase the number of students choosing STEM majors and continuing in those majors upon transfer to four-year colleges. The Research Engagement Across Curricular Tracks (REACT) project proposed here includes exploring the use of research as a tool for recruitment, retention and success among CDKC students. The second objective is to increase the number of STEM students entering the STEM workforce. The addition of a new Associate of Applied Science degree program to the college addresses this objective and will help students focus their skill sets and fulfill local STEM employer needs. The third objective of this work is to increase number of students choosing STEM majors upon enrollment in the Tribal College. To help accomplish this objective, the college will offer a summer research experience for area high school students. Students will interact with current research and older college age science research interns helping facilitate the transition from secondary school to college STEM programs."

The NMAMP provides support services and funding opportunities for Under Represented Minority (URM) students pursuing careers in STEM fields in the state of New Mexico. In Phase VI of the program, which will be years 26 through 30 of the program, NM AMP will include a social science/educational research component will seek to better understand the roles and interactions of students and faculty mentors in the development of scientists and engineers, and to better inform the design, execution, and assessment of such programs. Over the lifetime of NM AMP, the number of STEM B.S. degrees awarded annually to URMs in New Mexico has increased from 253 in 1992-93 to 858 in 2015-16. During the same time period, the percentage of B.S. STEM degrees awarded to URM students increased from 24% to 48%.<br/><br/>Phase VI on NM AMP will accomplish the following: 1) Sustain proven strategies and activities, 2) Implement enhancements to further improve students' educational experiences and prepare them for the STEM workforce and/or graduate studies; 3) Contribute to the development of institutional contexts that support URM student achievement through an innovative new faculty development workshop, and 4) Conduct social science research to further understand and disseminate findings on the challenges for URM students in STEM. The NM AMP Pathway supports URM students at partnering two- and four-year institutions and provides them with multiple opportunities to explore STEM programs and careers, engage in undergraduate research, and participate in additional programs and opportunities that support early career exploration, the development of STEM identity, and foster self-efficacy and the self-directed pursuit of academic and career goals. The Pathway rejects deficit-based thinking that assumes students lack either qualities or abilities for achievement and, instead, embraces a strengths-based approach that recognizes the unique contributions and interests of individual students and provides them with guidance and experiences that enable each student to achieve his or her full potential. Evidence-based activities along the Pathway include undergraduate research experiences (domestic and international), professional development events, and skills-building workshops.  The alliance will also support changes in institutional climate to increase learning and retention of URM students in STEM.  New activities and priorities include the following: 1) Implement a rigorous, mixed methods social science research project focused on better understanding the factors that shape students' scientific identity and STEM retention, including dissemination of outcomes in quick turnaround mini-studies and peer-review articles; 2) Enhance student support activities with the addition of entry level stipends that provide opportunities for students to explore research options early in their college careers, a Professional Development Webinar Series, and an E-Portfolio option; and 3) Pilot a new Context Diversity Faculty Development Workshop to promote effective change in learning environments to better support URM student achievement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team will develop, implement, test, and propagate effective practices for improving field site climate and safety. Sexual harassment is deeply entrenched in many workplaces including academia and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, and this issue has gained attention recently. While sexual harassment has been studied extensively in workplaces, including in academia, very little research has focused on this problem in field settings. This work is an essential step toward broadening participation of marginalized groups in the earth sciences in field-based scholarship. <br/><br/>This project will leverage the large networks supporting two upcoming major NSF-supported field campaigns (Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol Absorption and Nitrogen: WE-CAN; Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations: RELAMPAGO) to better understand and mitigate negative gender-based harassment in the field and during subsequent professional conferences or science-team meetings. The project aims to dramatically reduce sexual harassment in the earth sciences via these objectives: (1)Train participants in two major upcoming field campaign networks to recognize, report, and confront present and future situations of sexual harassment; (2) Build two new multi-institutional and international networks of proactive scientists, including men, who are invested in combating gender inequality; (3)Investigate the perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and experiences of earth science field researchers regarding sexual harassment; (4) Create a practical guide for future PIs to facilitate collaborative change around sexual harassment within major field campaign networks. The project will engage the field campaign networks throughout the entire lifecycle of the field campaign, from pre-campaign planning to post-campaign conferences. Based on prior research about sexual harassment in the workplace and academia, the study will focus on change in four major areas: (1) sexual harassment behavior (either perpetrated or experienced by participants); (2) sexual harassment knowledge; (3) sexual harassment responses and impacts; and (4) psychological antecedents for sexual harassment. A major strength of the proposal is that it will allow the examination of cross-cultural effects, as the activities will be tested in the context of both domestic and international field campaign settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  <br/><br/>The 2014-2019 Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP) program under the leadership of the University of Puerto Rico, includes three new members in the alliance from the private higher education sector in Puerto Rico to recruit STEM students in 2-year programs and promote their transfer to 4-year programs and advanced degrees in STEM fields. The alliance is comprised of: (1) the University of Puerto Rico System: two graduate campuses - Ro Piedras and Mayaguez and six 4-year campuses - Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamon, Cayey, Humacao, and Ponce; (2) the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico; and (3) the Ana G. Mndez University System - the Universidad Metropolitana, Universidad del Este, and Universidad del Turabo. The three new partner campuses of the Ana G. Mndez System offer ten 2-year degrees in a variety of STEM disciplines. In addition, during the project duration, PR-LSAMP increases its scope to include the ten 2-year programs offered at University of Puerto Rico institutions - Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamon, and Humacao. <br/><br/>PR-LSAMP impacts a large cadre of underrepresented college students in 2-year programs by expanding their opportunities to engage in undergraduate research and continue studies in 4-year and graduate institutions. The students' world view of science is broadened through research experiences at international and national research centers. It is anticipated that the efforts of PR-LSAMP  improves families' opinion of STEM careers and increase the number of underrepresented students that choose STEM careers, thus contributing to a diverse STEM workforce. The long-term impact will be significant as PR-LSAMP contributes at least 20% of undergraduate Hispanics. <br/><br/>Students and faculty in the 2-year programs participate in PR-LSAMP activities that will be modified to promote student completion of 4-year STEM degrees through mentored undergraduate research and faculty development through research projects and Learning Science Education Groups. The long-term goal of PR-LSAMP is to build a highly competitive STEM education and research enterprise and to assist in meeting the national need for a diverse STEM workforce. To reach this goal, the objectives of PR-LSAMP are to: 1) promote the efforts of students from 2-year programs, with particular emphasis on underrepresented college students, to continue and complete their BS degree in a 4-year institution; 2) increase the high rate of BS degrees conferred in STEM fields from PR-LSAMP institutions; 3) increase the number of students who enter a graduate degree program in STEM fields; 4) increase the number of students who complete a PhD program in a STEM field; 5) maintain and enhance the direct student support strategies, such as undergraduate research experiences and mentoring; 6) promote mentoring activities and institutionalize the exchange of successful teaching and learning strategies through PR-LSAMP STEM faculty collaboration; 7) promote faculty scholarly studies and improved STEM education through and Learning Science Education Groups; and 8) meet with high school counselors and send brochures to families to inform them about academic preparation and career opportunities in STEM. <br/><br/>PR-LSAMP provides a model for a seamless pipeline to increase the number of underrepresented groups that complete a PhD in STEM fields.

Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy, practice, culture, and organizational climate.  The ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) academic workforce.<br/><br/>University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) will implement an ADVANCE-IT project that will further our understanding of institutional practices and equity issues related to collaborative work by STEM faculty.  Although collaborative work is crucial to solving current scientific and engineering challenges, which often require inter- and cross- disciplinary approaches, this type of work is not recognized professionally in the same way as individual work. In fact, universities historically reward individual success more than collaborative success.  This project will attempt to mitigate this issue by developing and implementing strategies to recognize, reward, and encourage collaborative work by STEM faculty at UMass Amherst.  Collaboration is considered an important issue for equity and inclusion of diverse STEM faculty as many women and underrepresented minority faculty are involved in collaborative work.<br/><br/>The project model for change focuses on ensuring equitable access via three important components: resources, relationships, and recognition.  Equity is stronger where resources, relationships, and recognition intersect (R3), having multiplicative rather than additive effects. The project tests hypotheses on how to foster collaboration in research, inclusive community, and shared decision-making. Interventions will create more equitable research collaboration, by using resources, relationships and recognition to develop collaborative research opportunities for all faculty. Interventions will aim for a more inclusive faculty community with both formal and informal mentoring and open communication for all faculty. Departments will have access to resources, recognition, and relationships for supporting shared decision-making structures. The project includes closely related social science research studies: analyses of experiences with collaborations for white, Asian, and underrepresented minority men and women; controlled experiments to determine whether implicit biases about gender and race and their intersection affect how university committees credit collaborations; and a comparative ethnography of departments with more and less collaborative decision-making structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This focus will support LSAMP students in developing their scientist identity and self-efficacy through engagement in the culture of science and discussion of the role of race and social stigma in scientific training.  PNWLSAMP will also increase the number of URM students from Alliance institutions pursuing graduate education by 5-10% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""<br/><br/>The educational research study will take an assets-based and intersectional approach, examining factors that contribute to persistence in STEM for students from URM groups.  The research project will include a large multi-year study and four smaller ""sprint studies"" conducted by researchers across the Alliance.  The large study will examine how STEM students from URM groups navigate within historically exclusionary social institutional structures.  It will also include a participatory action element that engages students and administrators to develop strategies for improving equity on their campuses.  The sprint studies will each take place on one PNWLSAMP campus and focus on different dimensions of belonging in STEM for students from URM groups.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In alignment with these goals, the Leech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) project named ""Online, Outside, and in the Community: Making the Case for Science Education Relevance in Native American Communities"" provides a coherent suite of activities that enhance the college's STEM degree program. While the degree was developed to equip current and future generations of American Indian students with the skills necessary to enter a competitive and rapidly evolving STEM workforce, community surveys indicate a disconnect between these careers and the perceived importance and accessibility of STEM education within the community. To address this disconnect, the LLTC project builds the college's capacity to provide relevant, high quality STEM instruction and improved accessibility to STEM education within the Leech Lake communities. The project's activities focus on four main areas: outreach, expanding distance education offerings, improving access to technology, and student recruitment and retention. The multiple components are designed to improve STEM outcomes for Native students including increasing Native representation in the STEM workforce, thereby decreasing economic disparities within the Leech Lake community.<br/><br/>With their ongoing commitment to produce graduates prepared to answer the local and regional workforce demands, LLTC is extending beyond its traditional local student base to provide accessible STEM education through community service-oriented outreach and distance education development. The project utilizes an array of complementary activities including 1) the provision of wifi hotspots around the reservation community, computer skills training, and a computer loan program to increase Internet access for students; 2) the development of additional online STEM courses; 3) the modification of developmental math courses using Backward Design; 4) a series of culturally relevant STEM outreach activities in area high schools; 5) professional development training for their faculty on distance education instructional techniques; 6) the formation of a cohort structure for STEM students; and 7) the development of a formal recruitment strategy aimed at local secondary students. The strengthening of LLTC's educational capacity will result in long-term benefits for the both the college and the community including greater STEM enrollment, increased community engagement with LLTC STEM, higher numbers of Native graduates entering the local STEM workforce, and improved economic stability for Native people and their community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving these objectives requires that an increasing number of women in academia start and progress to the next stage. Alas, the percentages of women in academic positions in PhD-granting Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) departments indicate that women continue to be severely underrepresented. The failure to capitalize on the creativity of female researchers represents a huge opportunity cost to the U.S. economy and national security to grow our nations leadership in technical innovation. CRA-W will (1) develop programs to increase the number and successful promotion of women CSE faculty to tenured and full professor and (2) conduct comparative evaluation of participants in our programs versus non-participants. Our programs apply the unifying framework of Social Cognitive Career Theory, which finds that interest in and choice of a particular career path will be increased by interventions that improve one or more of the following: (1) outcome expectations (understanding and valuing the rewards of a particular outcome), (2) self-efficacy (a belief that one can successfully achieve an outcome), and (3) social supports that help one persist and overcome obstacles. Our long-term group and individual mentoring programs aim to make participants aware of the rewards of an academic career; to help participants develop self-efficacy through increased knowledge, skills, and confidence; and to connect participants to the computing research and education communities and to each other to further their success. Participants and research mentors attend an initial group workshop, re-connect in small mentoring groups yearly, and meet every three to four months electronically. <br/><br/>This ADVANCE PAID project seeks to improve equity in the discipline, through a coordinated suite of mentoring, role modeling, community building, and professional development workshops. The program adaptations are based on prior published research and our experiences and evaluation of programs in our portfolio. For example, the programs use results that show that individual faculty mentoring in other fields improve faculty success with respect to top venue publication, grant funding success, and promotion.  In addition, the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) will provide the first ever, longitudinal and national study of the factors that lead to successful academic careers for faculty in computing. In particular, CERP will evaluate whether our CRA-W intervention programs are effective at increasing the participation and success of faculty women in computing.  The evaluation efforts of CERP will yield a national faculty comparison database that will become a powerful national resource for the CSE community and for informing the wider research community on influencing success within academic careers.<br/>"

The vision of iCREDITS is to obtain sustainable generation capacity by shifting the paradigm from power delivery to energy delivery, using smartgrid concepts. In an energy delivery system, energy is viewed as a commodity, which can be produced, stored, and exchanged. This paradigm will lead to better economic sustainability due to more efficient generation, transmission and usage. This vision accommodates the creation of small microgrids, larger customer-driven microgrids in a distribution feeder and, ultimately, the smartgrid,which includes the generation, transmission, and distribution of the entire power system. The research focus of iCREDITS is to develop the fundamental science and engineering necessary for the energy delivery paradigm. The realization of the smartgrid vision requires addressing a second fundamental problem: the dramatic shortage of smartgrids workforce, exacerbated by the lack of diversity. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The proposed research will articulate four research strands, addressing the core components of a modern smartgrid architecture; iCREDITS will strive to combine the innovations within the research strands to advance the broad science and engineering of smartgrids. The challenge addressed by iCREDITS is to investigate the fundamental science in power systems, communication systems, disturbance modeling, and agent-based coordination mechanisms and their interactions to enable the energy-delivery paradigm. The iCREDITS educational initiatives effort will provide comprehensive pathways, starting in the K-12 system and continuing to the doctoral level.  The center's educational models are interdisciplinary and designed to serve a student population that is diverse in academic and cultural backgrounds.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The research agenda is transformative and focused on making deep contributions to the general field of smartgrids - a field that has profound impact on the U.S. economy and the sustainability of the nation's energy infrastructure. Project activities are designed with<br/>strong components of outreach and education, to enhance the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in smartgrids. iCREDITS will address the issues of underrepresentation by expanding the research and training pipeline and introducing specialized mentoring and retention mechanisms. iCREDITS will infuse smartgrids expertise in a range of academic programs, enhancing the competency of New Mexico State University."

Although inorganic and organic polymeric ferroelectric materials are widely used, organic single molecule ferroelectrics have untapped potential for environmentally friendly materials with superior activity. Many of the known ferroelectrics have shortcomings with regard to applications, such as cost, toxicity, or limited electronic properties. While applications are not the main goal of the Center project, the computational models and experimental results should prove to be valuable tools in designing materials with desirable properties.<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: The Center consists of a disciplinarily diverse research team whose collective goals are to develop and study new organic ferroelectric materials, while at the same time strengthening active research collaborations and personnel exchange between partner institutions. The Center's systematic search for new organic ferroelectrics relies on subproject teams in three distinct areas: (1) Theory and Computation; (2) Synthesis and Structure; and (3) Experimental Investigation. In the theory/computation subproject, crystallographic databases, first principles computations, and experience-based intuition will be used to predict likely candidates. The synthesis/structure team will prepare organic compounds, grow thin films, and explore polymorphic behavior of the crystalline materials.  The experimental investigation team will then determine ferroelectric and related piezoelectric properties experimentally, as a function of temperature, pressure, film thickness, and composition, as appropriate. These results will be utilized in subsequent iterations to predict the next set of ferroelectric candidates. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Ferroelectricity and the closely related properties piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, non-linear and high dielectric constant properties of materials have broad impacts on an extremely large range of areas. These include: scientific instrumentation, consumer products, national defense, medical devices, energy harvesting, energy storage, robotics, and aerospace. These applications represent billions of dollars to the economy and many high tech jobs. With its numerous applications, this research provides an excellent entry point to attract, then retain, encourage and motivate students, including underrepresented students. The potential for replacing environmentally unfriendly materials such as one of the leading piezoelectric, lead zirconium titanate, with more environmentally friendly organic materials should be particularly appealing. Students will receive a wide range of training on research grade instrumentation, experience with specific computational packages, and gain hands-on experience in synthetic organic chemistry and general laboratory techniques and procedures. The proposed research collaborations will further enhance the professional development of faculty at CSUSB and the partner community colleges."

Careful evaluation is expected to expand understanding of such initiatives   across institutions and institution types.<br/><br/>The Institutions Developing Excellence in Academic Leadership-National (IDEAL-N) project will build a learning community among 10 research universities in Ohio and Pennsylvania to promote gender equality in academic Science & Engineering (S&E) disciplines.  The 10 partner universities include Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Bowling Green State University, Cleveland State University, Kent State University, University of Akron and University of Toledo and Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh.  IDEAL-N will build on the successful transformations and outcomes achieved in the earlier CWRU ADVANCE project, IDEAL.  IDEAL-N is comprised of four elements: leadership enhancement training, annual change projects, plenary conferences, and development of an equity index.  The creation of this institutional learning community will benefit not only the practices and policies of the individual universities, but will also inform the nation's efforts to foster science and technology careers, stimulate and redirect economic development, and reverse the drain of talent from academic S&E.  <br/><br/>IDEAL-N targets senior administrators as the locus of change and provides intensified educational, leadership development, and support components.  The project will employ an innovative technology platform, using Cisco's TelePresence, to re-imagine and stimulate cost-effective information dissemination and networking for a national audience.  The project will identify multilevel Change Implementation Teams at each university to lead institutional transformation that include: a co-director, a change leader, and a social science faculty member.  The co-director will be a senior administrator at the Provost's Office level.  The change leader will be a department chair or senior faculty leader in an S&E department.  A social scientist is included to help translate social science theory and the promising practice literature on gender equity into actionable projects within S&E disciplines.  Annual change projects focused around a key institutional transformation theme will be implemented at each institution over three years.  Each Change Implementation Team will select a transformational theme/issue/need relevant to their campus to improve gender equity in a S&E department.  The change projects will vary in complexity and scope, but they will directly address the transformational theme within the IDEAL-N departments selected, and directly or indirectly address the larger institution.  Building on another extremely successful element of the previous IDEAL project, three plenary conferences will be held during the early summer of each year of IDEAL-N.  These conferences will use the TelePresence platform to gather senior academic leaders from the partner institutions, Change Implementation Team members, and national experts on academic leadership and gender equity to exchange knowledge and design solutions to effect change.  Based on the research and experience of previous ADVANCE projects, as well as from the literature on promoting gender equity in academic careers, IDEAL-N will develop an innovative Gender Equity Index to serve as an assessment and benchmarking tool for academic institutions.  The criteria for this index will include best practices to promote gender diversity, equity, and inclusion, with a special focus on disabled and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority women faculty.<br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in academic careers."

The Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ILSAMP) is a senior-level alliance comprised of universities and community colleges throughout the state and one federal laboratory.  The specific partners include the following four-year institutions:  Chicago State University, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Illinois State University, Northeastern Illinois University, Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, Edwardsville),  University of Illinois at Chicago, and Governors State University. Additional partners include five two-year institutions (Harry Truman College, Kennedy King College, Olive Harvey College, St. Augustine College, <br/>Wilbur Wright College) and one non-academic partner, Argonne National Laboratory. <br/><br/>This project will have four primary objectives.  These objectives are to: (1) develop interventions to bridge the achievement gap by recruiting, retaining and graduating underrepresented students of color in STEM; (2) develop partnerships with 2- and 4-year institutions, school systems, industry, government and veteran affairs; (3) continue international opportunities that will enable students to understand and participate successfully in global science endeavors; (4) continue institutionalization of effective activities begun during earlier levels of ILSAMP. The activities proposed will be designed to accomplish the central goal of increasing the number of historically underrepresented students who select STEM disciplines and persist to graduation from baccalaureate-producing institutions and who are prepared to successfully matriculate in graduate schools or obtain professional positions in STEM. The project will provide students with the academic and professional skills to function at the highest levels of competency.<br/><br/>ILSAMP activities will broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups, including ethnic and racial minorities in the STEM enterprise, by providing access to research and science programs. The alliance will not only help to close the gap created by the paucity of underserved individuals who are STEM professionals functioning creatively, it will also encourage others who have been reticent to attempt baccalaureate-level science work, e.g., veterans and students with GED education.  Advisory boards and committees will help to broaden the impact of ILSAMP through wide dissemination of project results. Input and assistance will also be furnished by a Technical Advisory Committee, the composition of which provides a connection with the Illinois business community, the public high schools, graduate schools, state and national policy makers and national research institutions. Results of process and impact evaluations combined with internal project assessment will provide insight on effective strategies for fostering student success in STEM and the effectiveness of the ILSAMP model. Findings will be shared at regional and national meetings and through social networking where the foci on underrepresented minority student persistence, performance, and advancement in STEM fields are discussed."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  Kansas Pathways to STEM LSAMP program was established in 2013 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the state of Kansas.  The overall goal of the project is to double, during the five years of the project, the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students receiving STEM baccalaureate degrees at the two universities.  The seven institutions that make up the Alliance are diverse and include five community colleges and two four-year institutions -- Barton County Community College, Dodge City Community College, Donnelly College, Garden City Community College, Seward County Community College, Wichita State University (WSU), and Kansas State University (KSU), the lead institution.  The Kansas Pathways to STEM Alliance objectives include to: 1) further develop a successful STEM pathway to the baccalaureate degree through the partnership of KSU and WSU with five Kansas community colleges with 2-year transferable programs; 2) work together to develop innovative and culturally appropriate recruitment materials and activities for high schools and college STEM programs; 3) develop and evaluate systematic approaches to assuring successful transfer to KSU, WSU, or other Kansas 4-year institutions with high quality science and engineering programs; 4) develop or improve academic, curricular and co-curricular activities that impact persistence and retention of URM students at 2- and 4-year partner institutions and at KSU, including special focus on critical pathway junctures (e.g., advising, financial assistance, campus integration); and 5) provide formative evaluation to assure continuous project improvement and to conduct summative evaluation to describe the results and impact of the project on students and institutions.  These objectives support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""  To accomplish this, the alliance institutions will review and improve their current practices in recruiting URM students into STEM majors, evaluate efforts to improve student persistence in these majors, and conduct student enhancement programs demonstrated to increase STEM self-efficacy.  Attention will be paid by all alliance partners to the critical junctures in post-secondary education such as transition from high school, institutional transfers, and career preparation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Possible explanations also include new physics beyond the Standard Model. The MUSE experiment aims to address one of the most pressing questions in nuclear and particle science to date. MUSE uses mixed muon and electron beams of either charge to make precise measurements of the lepton-proton elastic scattering cross sections and proton form factors, with the goal to extract the proton charge radius for each probe.  This requires precise measurements of the scattering angles necessitating the tracking of individual beam particles in a way not done before at low beam energies.

Intuitive Ideas about Motion and Support Teachers? Formative Assessment Practices<br/><br/>Learning progressions??descriptions of the successively more sophisticated ways of thinking about a topic that can follow one another as children learn? (National Research Council, 2007, p. 219)?have the potential to influence a wide range of educational policies and practice. However, learning progressions based upon research on students? misconceptions may not be well-suited to informing teachers? formative assessment practices (eliciting, interpreting, and responding to students? ideas). This project explores the premise that a focus on the productive nature of students? intuitive ideas may provide a stronger basis for both formative assessment practices and learning progressions that can support these practices. Insights derived from this work should influence the design of learning progressions, curricula, formative assessment strategies, and teacher preparation to be more responsive to students? intuitive ideas. The project will take place in high school physics classrooms and in the science teacher preparation program at Michigan State University. <br/><br/>The project consists of four strands. Strand A involves curriculum design work to redesign the introductory high school physics curriculum to highlight the productive nature of students? intuitive ideas about motion. Videos of classroom instruction and design team meetings, as well as evidence of student learning (interviews and student work samples) will be used to inform the design process.<br/>Starting with a single pilot teacher and later expanding to involve an additional six teachers, design principles will be developed that can be used to revise existing physics curricula to be more responsive to students? intuitive ideas.  Strand B uses the curriculum design research as the basis for developing an alternative force and motion learning progression and associated assessment items. Three rounds of revisions, drawing upon students? responses to the assessment items (in open-ended and ordered multiple-choice item formats, as well as in cognitive and think-aloud interviews) will be used to develop the learning progression and assessment items. Strands C and D focus on supporting teachers? formative assessment practices. Strand C entails a summer professional development workshop and ongoing assistance during the academic year to support in-service teachers? formative assessment practices, based upon the force and motion learning progression. Strand D involves application of ideas from the other three strands to inform revisions to the Michigan State University secondary science teacher preparation program. This effort represents an expansion and application of ideas about the potential of students? intuitive ideas to other science content areas and to work with novice teachers. An advisory board will provide formative and evaluative reviews of all project products and evidence for their use. A key indicator of success is whether formative assessment practices based on the alternative learning progression have a positive influence on student learning. <br/><br/>The project will directly involve seven in-service high school physics teachers and a cohort of approximately 30 secondary science pre-service teachers, as well as their students. The project will contribute specific examples of redesigned physics curricula and a learning progression, both building upon students? intuitive ideas. These examples will represent a departure from typical physics instruction, in which students? real world experiences are rejected as ?misconceptions.? The project will also contribute evidence of the use of a learning progression (and, more generally, an emphasis on the productive nature of students? intuitive ideas) to support teachers? formative assessment practices. Since formative assessment has been demonstrated to have a significant impact on student learning, particularly for lower-performing students, the products of this research have the potential to expand access to physics learning."

There is a pressing need to ensure that these students learn mathematics and are able to advance academically with equal access to science and mathematics education. Recent research suggests that early language development affects young children's cognitive representations of numbers and their number vocabulary.  A delay in language exposure, which occurs for more than 90% of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, may negatively impact number development.  It is also unknown whether children who acquire sign language early in life demonstrate delayed mathematical development.  This CAREER scholar will investigate how deaf or hard of hearing children, compared to hearing children, learn numbers.  The research will examine how language experiences affect the development of number representations, symbols and words.  Project activities will also include studies about how parents and children can be trained to impact number learning.  Results of this work are expected to provide information to parents, educators and researchers about how to help deaf or hard of hearing children learn numbers for mathematical development.<br/><br/>The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.  This award is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) and Linguistics programs.  ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Linguistics supports basic science in the domain of human language.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a model of the formation and quality of number systems as related to the timing of language acquisition and language modality, with an emphasis on advancing knowledge about how deaf and hard-of-hearing children learn number representations.  The basic premise is that language is needed before number concepts can be learned.  Research questions include:  (1) Do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who acquire American Sign Language (ASL) from birth follow the same trajectory in acquiring number knowledge as do their hearing peers?  (2)Do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who are exposed to language later in life follow the same trajectory in acquiring number knowledge as do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who acquire ASL from birth?  (3) Do delays in exposure to sign or spoken language affect children's ability to fluidly and automatically manipulate number representations?  (4) Can explicit training with labelling and counting sets increase the number knowledge of young signing deaf and hard-of-hearing children relative to non-number training? (5) Can structured parental interactions with deaf and hard-of-hearing children, in which parents label and count sets increase the number knowledge of deaf and hard-of-hearing children relative to interactions that are not about numbers?  A series of studies will be conducted to address these questions and results will be published, disseminated at professional conferences and shared with teachers via training workshops."

The AGEP Engineering Alliance works with URM postdoctoral scholars to provide them with mentoring, professional development training and the skills necessary to succeed in academic faculty positions. The model also addresses the needs of the early career faculty, including teaching pedagogy training, grant-writing and student mentoring education. The model work is through partnerships between the Georgia Institute of Technology, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, William Marsh Rice University, and the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of URM graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. While this Alliance is primarily funded by the AGEP program, additional support has been provided by the NSF INCLUDES program, which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change; the Directorate for Engineering's  Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) and the Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program; and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources' Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) and Centers for Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program.<br/><br/>As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The AGEP Engineering Alliance has the potential to advance a model to improve the success of URM early career faculty in the field of Engineering, which ultimately leads to improved academic mentorship for URM undergraduate and graduate students in STEM.<br/><br/>One of the research components of the Alliance investigates Engineering post-graduation plans for PhD graduates and their faculty pathways, and another study examines the policies and practices of higher education Engineering programs.<br/><br/>The AGEP Engineering Alliance team will work with the BSCS Science Learning to conduct formative and summative evaluations. They will also engage an Executive Board of institutional administrators and leaders, as well as an external Advisory Board.

The goals of the current work are to (1) Increase the number of women basic scientists (including racial/ethnic minority women scientists) recruited into COMs by changing the applicant pool and hiring practices; and (2) Improve the retention & advancement of women scientists (including racial/ethnic minority women scientists) in COMs by achieving the critical mass, changing the promotion practices, and providing key supports. This ADVANCE project is adapting strategies from research and best practices and disseminating the effective package of adaptations at a national level.  It is also addressing the specific barriers faced by women basic scientist faculty. The project work is designed to foster a culture that promotes recruitment, retention, participation, and advancement in a way that is both sustainable and serves as a viable model for peer institutions. Consistent with research on the theory of tokenism, which argues that women experience more discrimination (i.e., inequities) if they are tokens rather than a critical mass, the goal of the ARROWS package is to increase the overall number of women basic scientists employed (through both recruitment and retention) and holding positions of high rank and leadership as a means of achieving critical mass and overcoming the adverse effects associated with women perceiving themselves as tokens in the workplace. Within the framework of the empirically supported Social Ecological Model, multiple layers of influence (i.e., individual scientist, department, college, national network of COMs) that affect engagement and promotion of female and ethnically diverse scientists must be simultaneously targeted to accomplish this goal."

Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy, practice, culture, and organizational climate.  The ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) academic workforce.<br/><br/>The Arizona State University (ASU) ADVANCE-IT project will build on its successful transition to an interdisciplinary institutional structure and extend their operating theory of public values-based institutional design thinking to issues of equity for STEM faculty. Public values-based institutional design employs design thinking at all levels of the institution to enact policies and practices that forward goals in the public interest. The project will focus on improving outcomes for mid-to-late career STEM faculty at ASU through three initiatives to: 1) ensure that procedures on recruiting, promotion, evaluation, and retention explicitly address how to improve equity and diversity in an interdisciplinary structure; 2) provide appropriate and accessible professional development and mentoring opportunities; and 3) design, implement, and evaluate digital administrative systems to monitor equity-related processes, and empower administrators to intervene to ensure equitable opportunities and outcomes. This work is important since challenges in science and engineering require new approaches and it will be important to ensure all faculty - both traditionally disciplinary as well as those who operate as interdisciplinary scholars - can be successful and are not disadvantaged as STEM research moves toward more interdisciplinary structures.<br/><br/>ASU ADVANCE takes a life course approach to support professors from the beginning of the career, into the middle, and through senior and leadership positions. The social science research component of the project will use a mixed-methods approach to investigate how intersectionality and an interdisciplinary institutional structure play out across the academic life course. ASU is a strategic research site uniquely well-suited to study how disciplinary and interdisciplinary scholarship may change over the academic life course. ASU ADVANCE will enable the analysis of how known bases of difference in the academic life course - gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, foreign-born status, disability, rank, and discipline - interact with the interdisciplinary context to create opportunities and barriers to academic career advancement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. The primary aim of the proposed Cohort XII Texas A&M University System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TAMUS LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BTD) program is to increase the pool of science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) PhDs among underrepresented minority (URM) groups at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and create a cohesive community of graduate students across different disciplines within the university.  The goal is to foster academic success in a cohort of first-time URM STEM graduate students, by developing their readiness and encouraging eagerness to complete STEM doctoral degrees and by preparing them to take their place as leaders in interdisciplinary research and in academia. The broad significance of TAMUS LSAMP BTD is to increase participation of URM groups in STEM by providing opportunities and activities at the graduate levels that lead to educational and career enhancements of URM graduate students. Between 2008 and 2018 the number of jobs in the STEM field is expected to increase by 1.33 million from 7.64 million which represents a growth of 17% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Nov. 2009 Monthly Labor Review). By increasing the number of URM students that ultimately enter the STEM workforce, TAMUS LSAMP BTD is able to increase the economy, prosperity, and welfare of the nation. Objectives to carry out the program's goals include (1) retention of fellows into doctoral programs with funding after completion of the NSF BTD program, (2) preparation to meet the challenges of completing doctoral programs of study and for possible academic careers in higher education, and (3) leadership skill development necessary to succeed as young URM professionals upon completion of doctoral programs of study.<br/><br/>This will be achieved through collaborations among the College of Science (COS), the Dwight Look College of Engineering (COE), the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), and the College of Geosciences (COG) at TAMU. Twelve first-time graduate students from URM groups, in five departments in COS, fourteen in COE, fourteen in COALS, and four in COG will be selected as BTD Fellows. The Fellows will be nurtured for two years as a cohorted community benefiting from a program of academic and personal development activities and social support, to sustain their commitment and success to their degree programs and advancement toward doctoral programs by the end of their second year.  The BTD students, with differing STEM disciplines and a common purpose, will share coordinated resources and intellectually enriching group activities with each other, and also with the larger population of STEM, minority and other graduate students at TAMU, to the benefit of all.<br/><br/>Beyond the intellectual impact of BTD, the program will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by advancing pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees."

The situation is not improving, as the fraction of PhDs in physics awarded to underrepresented minorities (URM) among US citizens, about 5-6%, has not increased over the past decade. We propose to increase, within the next decade, the fraction of physics PhDs awarded to URM students toward levels more representative of the fraction of URMs that currently receive physics Bachelor?s degrees. We will do this by creating a national network of sustainable research-focused programs that bridge the transition from institutions where URM students receive their undergraduate education to top research universities. The American Physical Society (APS) occupies a unique position in the community to catalyze action and leverage resources to succeed in these goals and to bring about sustainable change in physics graduate education. <br/><br/>This project will establish ""Bridge Experiences"" that will help diverse students prepare for and make the transition to doctoral studies in physics. These Bridge Experiences will adopt best practices from existing programs, and follow either a Master?s degree or a post-Baccalaureate example. We have brought together Doctoral Granting Institutions (DGIs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and concerned organizations to inform and help build a national effort that will offer sustainable solutions to improved support, mentoring, and progress monitoring to ensure that students make the transition smoothly and complete their studies. Physics offers an ideal test-bed for Bridge Experiences, as only modest numbers of students are required to demonstrate success in mitigating the losses that currently occur in the transition to doctoral studies. We choose to focus on doctoral students because these students will become a cadre of future leaders who can catalyze national change in science education. In addition, the research and assessment components of this project will identify, document, and disseminate best practices that can serve as a model for other disciplines to encourage more of the nation?s capable underrepresented minorities (URM) undergraduates to pursue doctoral degrees. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit This program will use existing knowledge of Bridge Experiences that have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing minority participation at the doctoral level. Our project incorporates strong evidence about support structures that predict academic success of URM students, and establishes links between MSIs and DGIs through research activities, collaboration, and visits. We will conduct research on admissions and retention in physics doctoral programs, and the correlation of GRE scores with successful completion of a PhD. The program will utilize our 30+ year experience in supporting minorities through our Minority Scholarship Program and its associated mentoring efforts, our long-standing connections with the physics research community, and our decade-long efforts in working with individuals and universities to promote teacher education through the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts This project will provide a model of graduate education for URM students that can be applied to other Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields as well as improved links between MSIs and DGIs. In addition, physics is taken by nearly every STEM student, and significantly increasing the number of minority PhDs in physics will enhance the diversity of the physics academy and professional workforce. This project is intended to meet the challenges posed by the National Academy?s report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, including ensuring that the workforce brings a diverse perspective to scientific and technological challenges. Since many doctoral students we prepare will become tomorrow?s academic, industrial and government leaders, educating more minority PhDs will have a multiplicative effect in educating and inspiring students at all stages in the system, and will help address disparities that persist today."

The AGEP Engineering Alliance works with URM postdoctoral scholars to provide them with mentoring, professional development training and the skills necessary to succeed in academic faculty positions. The model also addresses the needs of the early career faculty, including teaching pedagogy training, grant-writing and student mentoring education. The model work is through partnerships between the Georgia Institute of Technology, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, William Marsh Rice University, and the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of URM graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. While this Alliance is primarily funded by the AGEP program, additional support has been provided by the NSF INCLUDES program, which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change; the Directorate for Engineering's  Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) and the Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program; and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources' Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) and Centers for Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program.<br/><br/>As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The AGEP Engineering Alliance has the potential to advance a model to improve the success of URM early career faculty in the field of Engineering, which ultimately leads to improved academic mentorship for URM undergraduate and graduate students in STEM.<br/><br/>One of the research components of the Alliance investigates Engineering post-graduation plans for PhD graduates and their faculty pathways, and another study examines the policies and practices of higher education Engineering programs.<br/><br/>The AGEP Engineering Alliance team will work with the BSCS Science Learning to conduct formative and summative evaluations. They will also engage an Executive Board of institutional administrators and leaders, as well as an external Advisory Board.  The boards will provide feedback to the Alliance team and suggest adjustments to the project's management, to the research, and to the model development, implementation, testing, evaluation, dissemination, sustainability and reproduction potential.

A primary goal of MoLSAMP is to increase the recruitment, retention and successful STEM degree completion of URMs by at least 125% by the year 2021. This goal will help to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM education and the workforce, and with the success of MoLSAMP supported activities, inform the broader efforts of colleges and universities nationwide to diversify the STEM student population and ultimately strengthen our nation's science based workforce. Minority students face a variety of challenges that contribute to their underrepresentation in STEM degree programs. These challenges include insufficient preparation for college level STEM coursework, financial hardship and failure to socially and culturally integrate during the first year of college. MoLSAMP scholars will receive a variety of support mechanisms to mitigate these factors, including intrusive academic advising, ample opportunity to explore applied science through research and internship opportunities, social, academic and career networking opportunities through MoLSAMP organized social gatherings, social media platforms, mentoring programs, and summer bridge programs. MoLSAMP activities will also include measures to increase successful transfer of students from St. Louis Community College to four year degree Alliance institutions, and a 25% increase in URM students entering graduate programs. Successfully and substantially increasing the number of URM students completing degrees, entering graduate programs, working in research laboratories and importantly, teaching and mentoring the next generation of URM STEM students, should provide a scaffold for a sustainable increase in diversity in STEM education and industry."

The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree. <br/><br/>The University of Georgia (UGA) is the host site for the 2017-2019 Bridge to the Doctorate (B2D) program for the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLAMP) under the leadership of University of Georgia. This is the first post-baccalaureate program at the institution that supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry. <br/><br/>Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at UGA serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM Ph.D. degrees and entering the STEM workforce.  Formative and summative evaluation will occur with the summative evaluation including a comparison group to assess impact of the program interventions on student outcomes.  The evaluation question asks:  Are PSLAMP completers who participate in B2D more likely than PSLAMP completers who do not participate in B2D to complete doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines?<br/><br/>The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing future STEM leaders, the value added is seen in the visibility of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation."

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, West Virginia State University (WVSU) will conduct research to provide in-depth knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that regulate seed storage compounds, including the identification and characterization of genes that regulate the storage of lipids, starch, and proteins in seeds. This project will strengthen WVSU's plant biosciences research program, ensure student achievement in research, and the creation of a pipeline of graduates who will go on to pursue STEM careers in the plant sciences.  In addition, this project will enhance intra-and inter-institutional interdisciplinary research collaborations and provide collaborative mentoring of students. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of action of cupins and their associated gene networks in plant nutrient metabolism and storage pathways using the Arabidopsis model. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) determine whether cupins are required for seed storage compound regulation in Arabidopsis, 2) determine if ectopic expression of cupins in Arabidopsis alters the production of seed compounds and plant physiology and growth, and 3) characterize the transcriptome signature of wild-type and cupin mutant Arabidopsis plants that produce varying levels of seed storage compounds.  Findings from this work will determine whether cupins, a previously unidentified network of proteins, are master regulators of seed storage compound metabolism. Cupins may significantly reduce the negative effects of current agricultural practices on the environment, including overuse of arable land and water and increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. This work will be conducted in collaboration with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The research and educational activities will advance the academic mission of WVSU."

One problem creating this shortage is that more than half of all college students who declare a major in STEM fields drop out or change their majors in the first two years of their post-secondary education.  This problem is particularly acute for first generation college students.  If we could increase the STEM degree completion rate by just 25%, we would make up 75% of the additional workforce needed over the next decade.  This project assembles undergraduate students, K-12 educators, college faculty and policy makers in West Virginia to form the First2 STEM Success Alliance.  The Alliance aims to improve the college enrollment rate and success of undergraduate STEM students, with emphasis on rural first generation (FG) students through their first 2 years of college. At the core of our shared vision to improve student STEM success is the assumption that the students themselves should be co-creators of the solutions.  The First2 Alliance will engage over 350 undergraduate FG students in the Networked Improvement Communities (NICs), research internships, peer-mentoring activities, and the FIRST Ambassador Program. As FIRST Ambassadors, students are guided to explore the disconnect between home life and STEM study, and conduct outreach to hometown students and K-12 stakeholders, their collegiate institutions, and their state legislators to illuminate the disconnect and suggest policy/practice changes to better support rural first generation STEM student success.  <br/><br/>Our change strategy is to implement the proven methodologies of Networked Improvement Communities (NICs) to  study, improve and replicate promising programs that impact STEM persistence. Specifically, First2 Improvement teams will: 1) improve preparation for and transition to college; 2) replace ingrained institutional practices that stifle the development of STEM self-efficacy with 3) connect rural home culture and college STEM culture.  As a rural state, West Virginia lags behind in the development of networks, alliances and  long-term collaborations.  The First2 Student Success Alliance will execute a comprehensive plan to build organizational capacity for a long-term Alliance, which includes a permanent hub organization and in so doing we will learn how to collaborate effectively and will document what we learn. The First2 Alliance model can be disseminated  to assist other rural states in developing their own STEM-capable workforce.  Finally, the First2 Alliance will advance our knowledge of  barriers to and solutions that increase  the success of first generation students in STEM. There are many studies that inquire into the factors that correlate with post-secondary retention in general, and with STEM attrition specifically but few that focus on rural students.  The First2 Alliance will conduct a rigorous educational research study aimed at advancing understanding of the factors affecting rural students' entry into and persistence in STEM career pathways.  From an improvement science and research perspective, we hypothesize that our work will apply to improving the persistence of all first generation STEM students, not just rural students.<br/><br/>This NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). EPSCoR enhances research competitiveness of targeted jurisdictions (states, territories, commonwealth) by strengthening STEM capacity and capability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This consortium of sixteen institutions is a unique reconstituted alliance with an urban/rural dichotomy, encompassing a distance of 550 miles between two states.  CO-WY AMP will continue to work tirelessly to increase the representation of underrepresented students in the Western U.S. by preparing them to excel in an economically competitive global workforce. <br/><br/>CO-WY AMP will use Engagement, Capacity and Continuity: A Trilogy for Student Success (ECC Trilogy) as a model to advance students in the sciences and quantitative disciplines on all partner campuses, which include two research-intensive universities, five high research universities, three comprehensive universities, one liberal arts college, and five community colleges. The three factors of the ECC Trilogy are defined as: engaging the student both academically and socially to foster positive attitudes and increase subject mastery (Engagement); preparing the student for fundamental knowledge necessary to advance (Capacity); and providing access that offers resources necessary for advancement (Continuity). CO-WY AMP will apply the trilogy model through the following goals: <br/>1) Increase retention and subsequent attainment of baccalaureate degrees;<br/>2) Increase the quality and quantity of students transferring from 2-year to 4-year institutions by providing skill-building interventions to strengthen students' mathematical knowledge and Summer Bridge experiences to enrich STEM achievement;<br/>3) Facilitate pure and applied undergraduate research experiences both domestic and international and develop summer research experiences at both 2 and 4-year institutions; and<br/>4) Expand capacity for preparation and matriculation into graduate programs.<br/><br/>The knowledge generating research study, namely ""the Mathematics Research Study"", seeks to understand ultimately whether the algebra skills of community college students could be improved using cognitively-guided and self-reflective supplemental materials outside of the classroom environment.

The MI-LSAMP currently consists of four, 4-year institutions (University of Michigan, lead institution; Michigan State University; Wayne State University; Western Michigan University) and two community colleges (Mott Community College and Washtenaw Community College). The goals of MI-LSAMP are to significantly increase the:<br/><br/>1) Retention and graduation of underrepresented students in STEM bachelor's degree programs via comprehensive support programs and mentored research; <br/>2) Number of students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups transferring to STEM bachelor's degree programs; and <br/>3) Number of students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups pursuing graduate degrees in STEM fields.<br/><br/>These goals support NSF's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens."" The goals will be accomplished through activities such as pre-first year summer programs, faculty mentored research, student-to-student mentoring, and a comprehensive 2-year STEM-emphasis transfer program that will include a specialized curriculum and the establishment of a complete wrap-around academic and social support at the community college partner institutions. In addition, the community college students would be afforded the opportunity to participate in a summer bridge program between high school and their first year in community college and then again the summer between community college and transfer to a 4-year institution. The increased engagement with community colleges, greater involvement of faculty mentors from diverse STEM disciplines, and heightened institutional commitment to underrepresented students' well-being and success will produce higher rates of retention and graduation; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The knowledge generating research study is focused investigating the community college pathways to STEM Baccalaureate degrees for students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in STEM.

B2B STAMP will employ three strategies for success: 1) math acceleration for first and second year students, 2) peer mentoring, and 3) undergraduate research experiences (URE) for students as they mature academically in their sophomore year and transition to baccalaureate STEM degrees. The B2B STAMP retention and progression strategy of providing math acceleration, peer mentoring and undergraduate research experiences will strengthen the next generation of STEM Scholars who can compete in the STEM workforce while advancing science, technology, and sustainability goals and achievements for the people of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands."

This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Delaware State University aims to examine the feasibility of increasing the output energy in ultra-short laser pulses by over 100 times via the Stimulated Raman Backscattering (SRBS) technique. If this project succeeds, it could transform ultra-high intensity lasers, which in turn would have great technological and scientific impact.  The project will strengthen research capacity and provide educational opportunities to students in the area of plasma physics. This project is funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>An alternative to the present chirped pulse amplification for high power laser is the Stimulated Raman Backscattering (SRBS) scheme, where a resonant interaction in plasma coherently mediates energy transfer from the long pump into the much shorter seed. The backscattered short seed should undergo simultaneous amplification and compression, and since plasma is impervious to optical damage and has unique dispersion properties, its power can grow to extraordinary levels. Feasibility of SRBS lasers was demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. Still, despite some progress over the past decade, the maximum amplified pulse energy was limited to milli-joule levels due to early saturation. This project addresses obstacles in SRBS through an integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental approach, and aims to develop a solid theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism for the early saturation, verified by simulation and confirmed with experiments; develop a scheme to overcome the saturation limit and prove that the saturation barrier can be resolved; and demonstrate how a coherent, single spiked, and single cycled petawatt laser pulse can be generated via a moving soliton cavity in a millimeter-long plasma."

USF's FGLSAMP BD Project will provide the unique academic setting and multiple opportunities to facilitate the professional advancement of LSAMP graduates committed to both achieving outstanding careers in engineering, computational, mathematics, and scientific disciplines (physical, biological, geosciences), and shaping the nation's 21st century STEM research agenda. The new FGLSAMP BD Activity will boldly build upon the overwhelming success of six previous FGLSAMP USF BD awards (94% of students are expected to earn an advanced STEM degree) by institutionalizing the best practices initiated with the 2004 BD Project to all USF STEM majors. The project also embodies proven organizational and operational principles by extending the successful LSAMP model of empowering minority undergraduates toward achieving academic and social integration and professionalization in the sciences into graduate STEM programs.  <br/><br/><br/>By around 2020, more than half of the nation's children are expected to come from minority or ethnic groups according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In response to these changing demographics, both the National Academies and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) have documented the need to increase the participation of individuals from historically underrepresented groups in S&E to help maintain the nation's competitiveness in technology and research innovation. As such, an expected benefit of this university-wide, unified, institutionally integrated FGLSAMP BD project will be to help revitalize the national talent pool of domestic PhD trained scientists and engineers. Another benefit of the FGLSAMP BD activity will be to help address the critical shortfall of individuals from underrepresented groups who become STEM faculty. Through evidence-based practices (e.g., proposal writing preparation, peer-to-peer mentoring, minority scientist role model interactions, engagement with undergraduates and K-12 students, etc.), this FGLSAMP BD activity will seek to encourage a greater number of URM students to pursue both academic careers and nontraditional STEM career pathways (entrepreneurship, governmental research, industry, etc.) The five measurable objectives for the project are as follows: 1) Recruit twelve (12) minority students as NSF FGLSAMP BD fellows by fall 2016 into all USF STEM Colleges, 2) Initiate professional development activities to prepare FGLSAMP BD fellows and FGLSAMP scholars across the Alliance for competitive NSF GRFP applications and other fellowship programs, 3) Support the transition of all USF FGLSAMP BD fellows into STEM PhD programs, 4) Prepare FGLSAMP BD fellows to become globally engaged researchers through cutting-edge research projects and interactions with international scientists; and 5) Implement new graduate student mentoring and outreach initiatives that will both encourage students to pursue academic careers and also help to broaden the national participation of URM students in STEM."

One problem creating this shortage is that more than half of all college students who declare a major in STEM fields drop out or change their majors in the first two years of their post-secondary education.  This problem is particularly acute for first generation college students.  If we could increase the STEM degree completion rate by just 25%, we would make up 75% of the additional workforce needed over the next decade.  This project assembles undergraduate students, K-12 educators, college faculty and policy makers in West Virginia to form the First2 STEM Success Alliance.  The Alliance aims to improve the college enrollment rate and success of undergraduate STEM students, with emphasis on rural first generation (FG) students through their first 2 years of college. At the core of our shared vision to improve student STEM success is the assumption that the students themselves should be co-creators of the solutions.  The First2 Alliance will engage over 350 undergraduate FG students in the Networked Improvement Communities (NICs), research internships, peer-mentoring activities, and the FIRST Ambassador Program. As FIRST Ambassadors, students are guided to explore the disconnect between home life and STEM study, and conduct outreach to hometown students and K-12 stakeholders, their collegiate institutions, and their state legislators to illuminate the disconnect and suggest policy/practice changes to better support rural first generation STEM student success.  <br/><br/>Our change strategy is to implement the proven methodologies of Networked Improvement Communities (NICs) to  study, improve and replicate promising programs that impact STEM persistence. Specifically, First2 Improvement teams will: 1) improve preparation for and transition to college; 2) replace ingrained institutional practices that stifle the development of STEM self-efficacy with 3) connect rural home culture and college STEM culture.  As a rural state, West Virginia lags behind in the development of networks, alliances and  long-term collaborations.  The First2 Student Success Alliance will execute a comprehensive plan to build organizational capacity for a long-term Alliance, which includes a permanent hub organization and in so doing we will learn how to collaborate effectively and will document what we learn. The First2 Alliance model can be disseminated  to assist other rural states in developing their own STEM-capable workforce.  Finally, the First2 Alliance will advance our knowledge of  barriers to and solutions that increase  the success of first generation students in STEM. There are many studies that inquire into the factors that correlate with post-secondary retention in general, and with STEM attrition specifically but few that focus on rural students.  The First2 Alliance will conduct a rigorous educational research study aimed at advancing understanding of the factors affecting rural students' entry into and persistence in STEM career pathways.  From an improvement science and research perspective, we hypothesize that our work will apply to improving the persistence of all first generation STEM students, not just rural students.<br/><br/>This NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). EPSCoR enhances research competitiveness of targeted jurisdictions (states, territories, commonwealth) by strengthening STEM capacity and capability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. This Alliance is also funded by the NSF Research Traineeship Program (NRT) and the NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP). <br/><br/>As the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between URM and non-URM undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote URM STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for URM students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The Texas A&M System AGEP Alliance has potential to advance a model to improve the success of URM graduate students and post-doctoral scholars as they enter and advance in the STEM professoriate.<br/><br/>The Texas A&M System AGEP Alliance is developing, implementing and studying a new model for advancing dissertating STEM doctoral candidates as they complete their doctorates, enter postdoctoral fellowships, and succeed in faculty positions.  Participants include women and men who are either African American, Hispanic American or Native American and who are majoring in the fields of Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Marine Biology, and Wildlife Science. The model development, implementation and testing, focuses on a unique set of interventions, including using individualized development plans for participants as they transition from dissertator to postdoctoral scholar to faculty; providing participants with professional development opportunities related to communication, writing, networking and job preparation/transition; supporting participants with mentors at the institutional and field-specific expert levels; and offering participants opportunities to experience academic culture and activities at historically black colleges and universities. The integrated research will address the effects of stigmatization on male and female adults who are non-STEM and STEM African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  The formative and summative evaluation is being conducted by Drs. Erin Burr and Kimberle Kelly, from the Oak Ridge Associated Universities. There is an external advisory committee which will provide feedback to the team on the effectiveness and outcomes of the project, as well as a separate external advisory group for the integrated research studies."

HSCCs have large enrollments of Hispanic and low-income students and are therefore important partners for increasing the participation of diverse individuals in STEM education programs and careers. Many HSCCs have not been successful in securing federal grant projects, which is often attributed to the lack of infrastructure at HSCCs to develop and implement large federal grants. This project will increase the numbers of HSCCs that successfully pursue federal grants, particularly from the National Science Foundation, ultimately increasing recruitment and retention in STEM through enhancements to these institutions' STEM curricula, strengthening ties to industry and community partners, and developing robust articulation pathways to four-year STEM programs. The KickStarter project will provide intensive technical assistance to 10-15 HSCCs. In addition, all community colleges in the country will have an opportunity to benefit from access to the tools, materials, and lessons learned through KickStarter webinars and conference presentations.<br/><br/>The KickStarter team will implement an innovative and comprehensive technical assistance model designed to address the issues associated with the HSCCs' low level of success in submitting and securing federal STEM grant proposals. According to the proposers, the issues most often cited in reviews of declined federal proposals include the lack of readiness to conceive, justify, and execute complicated projects. The KickStarter technical assistance model will address these issues by developing a ""Readiness Framework"" in collaboration with the HSCCs. The framework will be based on institutional self-evaluation of student support services, industry engagement, and technology and curricular alignment. This framework will guide the development of STEM proposals that demonstrate capacity for project implementation and align with the institutional mission and STEM education goals of the HSCC. The KickStarter team has expertise in building community college partnerships with industry and community organizations, and deep knowledge of and experience with federal grant programs and grant management. This project has the potential to become a technical assistance model for other minority-serving community colleges, such as two-year Historically Black Colleges and Tribal Colleges."

The AGEP CA HSI Alliance model focuses on pedagogical training and faculty career mentoring to prepare historically underrepresented minority (URM) doctoral students, who are at the stage in their training where they are completing their dissertations, for teaching-focused faculty careers at colleges and universities. While the model work is through partnerships between UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Merced, CSU-Fresno and CSU-Channel Islands, the project is creating a model that will be applicable in other states with multi-tier systems, as well as the UC and CSU systems.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. This Alliance is also funded by the NSF's Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST).<br/><br/>The Alliance model is targeting processes for developing, implementing and testing faculty career mentoring and instructional trainings, including: (1) a summer institute for students to learn pedagogical practices for CSU curricula and classrooms; (2) a pairing of CSU faculty members with UC doctoral students to mentor them on discipline-specific teaching strategies and goals; (3) a semester-long teaching fellowship to incorporate research, assessment, and service-learning opportunities into CSU classrooms; (4) assistance with transitions to postdoctoral fellowships, when necessary, as part of the preparation for a teaching faculty position; and (5) networking and social support from the AGEP cohort and program while the URM doctoral students complete their dissertations and enter the STEM academic faculty workforce.<br/><br/>The research component is investigating the attitudes and assumptions of Ph.D. students and faculty members regarding pursuing faculty positions at non-research-intensive institutions. It is assessing career goals of URM and non-URM STEM doctoral students, as well as STEM faculty values and norms regarding their students' careers.

The specific aims of this project are to: 1) characterize the in situ midgut microflora of the red deep-sea crab and the microbiome in the in situ benthic ocean environment of the red deep-sea crab; and 2) characterize the stability of microbial communities after exposure to surface water microbiome in a controlled closed system. This study will contribute to our understanding of: a) the effect of dispersal on microbial communities by comparing datasets from three geographic locations; b) the role of environmental microbial flora in establishing the stable symbiotic communities within the crab; c) the effect of seasonal variation on the microbial communities from benthic environment and those associated with crabs. It will also set a biological reference point for future research. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of microbial ecology specifically: microbial dispersal, the effect of seasonal variation and how the crab gut communities are influenced by their environment. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), University of Delaware and Atlantic Red Crab Company (local fishing industry)."

The project at Lane College seeks to improve the first-year experience for Biology and Chemistry majors. The project aims to improve student retention, engagement, and academic progress in STEM by infusing research and peer-led team learning in General Biology and General Chemistry foundational courses. Lane College freshmen are mainly from underserved minority populations, and many are first generation college students who would not otherwise receive the benefit of higher education. In addition, very few students engage in undergraduate research opportunities and most are underprepared for a career in STEM. This project will engage a large number of underserved minority students in scientific research, improve student foundational laboratory skills, and provide students with qualifications for graduate and professional school. It will significantly increase the number of Lane College students completing the Biology and Chemistry programs. These benefits will result in an increase in the number of minority students entering STEM fields, thereby leading to a more diverse workforce. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to improve STEM retention through student-focused approaches that enhance student learning and core competencies within foundational courses: General Biology and General Chemistry. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) Adopt and implement an evidence-based Peer Tutoring approach in foundational courses for Biology and Chemistry to increase student retention and academic performance; and 2) Develop core competencies necessary for success in a career in science early through inquiry-based experiences in General Biology and General Chemistry Laboratory courses. The benefits of achieving the objectives of this project include: 1) increased student learning of fundamental concepts in Biology and Chemistry; and 2) improved STEM education and research at Lane College while honing students' interest in STEM fields as a major and as a career. This project is a collaborative effort between the Biology and Chemistry departments within the Division of Natural and Physical Sciences and Mathematics."

The current project is one of the first to investigate usage of such wires in an cylindrical detector. More generally, the usage of carbon mono laments could be a boon for experiments requiring detection and tracking of low momentum protons and nuclei due to the potentially significant reduction in energy lost over traditional metal wires. The technology for producing carbon nanotube wires offering conductivity surpassing that of copper wires has just now become available, with mass production likely available over the next few years.<br/><br/>This EAGER is co-funded by the Directorates for Education & Human Resources and Mathematical & Physical Sciences."

This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to detect flashes caused by small objects impacting the giant planet Jupiter. As demonstrated by recent impacts recorded by amateur astronomers, the intensity of impact flashes indicates the size of the impactors; if enough flashes are observed, the measurements will reveal the size distribution of those impactors. This in turn can help understand how the outer solar system has evolved since its formation. The project will facilitate installing a roof-top observatory, in which a telescope will be operated by a team of undergraduate students who will take charge of conducting the Jovian impact survey. The roof-top observatory will also enable the university to host outreach events for local students from elementary and high schools as well as the general public.<br/><br/>The project's objective is to measure the size distribution of Jovian impactors, which are thought to be members of the Jupiter Family Comets (JFC) that originate beyond Neptune's orbit. Most JFCs are too dim for direct telescopic observation from Earth, so the project will observe Jupiter impacts to measure the sizes of objects that are otherwise impossible to observe. If the JFC size distribution shows signs of numerous collisions in the past, it would be consistent with the hypothesis that Uranus and Neptune violently migrated outward early in the solar system history and scattered primordial planetesimal objects. If the JFC population contains more small fragments than expected from collisions, it would reveal that most comets eventually break up during their repeated close encounters with the sun. If the JFC population contains few small objects, it would indicate that at least some JFCs have been left undisturbed since the formation of the solar system. The main technical challenge here is to detect a sufficient number of impacts to build a statistically significant size distribution. The goal of the current exploratory project is to reduce uncertainties regarding the number of impacts per year to enable a larger impact survey in the future.<br/><br/>This EAGER project is co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

The AGEP CA HSI Alliance model focuses on pedagogical training and faculty career mentoring to prepare historically underrepresented minority (URM) doctoral students, who are at the stage in their training where they are completing their dissertations, for teaching-focused faculty careers at colleges and universities. While the model work is through partnerships between UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Merced, CSU-Fresno and CSU-Channel Islands, the project is creating a model that will be applicable in other states with multi-tier systems, as well as the UC and CSU systems.<br/><br/>This alliance was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552). The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. This Alliance is also funded by the NSF's Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST).<br/><br/>The Alliance model is targeting processes for developing, implementing and testing faculty career mentoring and instructional trainings, including: (1) a summer institute for students to learn pedagogical practices for CSU curricula and classrooms; (2) a pairing of CSU faculty members with UC doctoral students to mentor them on discipline-specific teaching strategies and goals; (3) a semester-long teaching fellowship to incorporate research, assessment, and service-learning opportunities into CSU classrooms; (4) assistance with transitions to postdoctoral fellowships, when necessary, as part of the preparation for a teaching faculty position; and (5) networking and social support from the AGEP cohort and program while the URM doctoral students complete their dissertations and enter the STEM academic faculty workforce.<br/><br/>The research component is investigating the attitudes and assumptions of Ph.D. students and faculty members regarding pursuing faculty positions at non-research-intensive institutions. It is assessing career goals of URM and non-URM STEM doctoral students, as well as STEM faculty values and norms regarding their students' careers. It is also examining the perceptions of faculty normative beliefs held by doctoral students at UC campuses. Framed in terms of social norms theory, the research is comparing the degree to which doctoral students' perceptions of faculty members' views match the faculty's own stated views and norms regarding career choices. <br/><br/>The AGEP CA HSI Alliance team will work with external consultants at SmartStart Evaluation and Research, to conduct formative and summative evaluations. They will also engage an Executive Board of UC and CSU administrators and leaders, as well as an external Advisory Board.  The boards will provide feedback to the Alliance team and suggest adjustments to the project's management; to model development, implementation, testing, dissemination, and sustainability; to the mechanisms for replication and reproduction; to the evaluation; and to the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for underrepresented.  The Michigan AGEP Alliance for Transformation (MAA): Mentoring and Community Building to Accelerate Successful Progression into the Professoriate represents a collaboration between the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University.<br/><br/>The long-term vision and planned outcome of MAA is to increase the success U.S. citizens who are underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in all fields of STEM through graduate study, postdoctoral training and the professoriate.  This vision and outcome is being addressed by pursuing the following three overarching goals of the MAA:<br/>1) Adapting two existing models, one for fostering multidisciplinary learning communities with diverse students and the other for improving faculty mentoring of URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to the needs of the five MAA campuses; <br/>2) Studying their effects on the academic identity and career progress of U.S. citizens who are URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in STEM programs; and <br/>3) Implementing more widely on campuses those models that lead to improved academic outcomes and widespread institutional change.<br/><br/>The objectives for this project are:<br/>Objective 1: Designing, adapting and implementing evidence-based mentoring initiatives, on all five campuses, that are focused on improved mentoring for U.S. URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in all fields of STEM.  <br/>Objective 2: Designing, adapting and implementing evidence-based initiatives to promote interdisciplinary learning communities, on all five campuses, that are focused on improved mentoring for U.S. URM STEM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  <br/>Objective 3: Conducting research about the ways in which improved mentoring and improved sense of community are linked to a sense of academic identity, and the ways in which academic identity is linked to important academic and career outcomes, for U.S. URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in all STEM fields.<br/>Objective 4: Conducting research about the ways in which departmental and university variables moderate the relations among mentoring, community, academic identity and academic outcomes for U.S. citizens who are URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in all STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The primary activities that contribute to the model for the alliance include: <br/>1. Designing, adapting and implementing the University of Michigan's Mentoring Others Results in Excellence (MORE) model as a foundation for improving mentoring of U.S. URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in STEM.  This includes training facilitators who run faculty mentoring workshops, conducting mentoring workshops, training advanced level students for intergenerational mentoring, and developing/distributing individualized mentoring agreements to faculty and STEM programs.<br/>2. Designing, adapting and implementing the Michigan State University's interdisciplinary learning community model as a foundation for improving the sense of belonging, peer support and academic identify of U.S. URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in STEM.  This includes training facilitators, conducting institution-specific community meetings, and holding MAA-wide community meetings for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.<br/><br/>The MAA includes a social science research study that will explore the mechanisms that help explain the under-representation and attrition of URM students in STEM, as well as the contextual and individual factors that can promote academic persistence and success in those fields.  The research team predicts that racial/ethnic stigma experiences in students' academic contexts lead to dis-identification from the academic discipline, which then leads to lower academic performance and completion.  They also predict that contextual-level resources, such as high-quality mentoring, moderate these relationships.  Examples of specific study hypotheses being tested include:<br/>1. Students reporting more negative department diversity climates (stigma experiences) will report lower sense of belonging (affective indicator of academic identity) in their academic departments than students reporting positive diversity climates.<br/>2. Students reporting having higher quality mentoring relationships with their faculty advisors will report more positive academic identity outcomes (higher perceived preparation, higher sense of belonging, higher curricular/professional involvement) than students reporting lower quality mentoring relationships.<br/>3. Quality mentoring will moderate the association between stigma (e.g., reported negative department climate) and academic identity (e.g., reported sense of belonging), such that the negative association of negative department diversity climate with sense of belonging will be stronger for students reporting lower quality mentoring relative to those reporting higher quality mentoring."

Deciphering the factors and regulatory pathways affecting antimicrobial resistance in commensal Neisseria will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that evolved in commensal and pathogenic species. The goals of this study are to characterize antimicrobial resistance levels of planktonic cells, of cells in biofilms, and to identify the factors and regulatory mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance in these cell populations of commensal Neisseria species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project at Lincoln University seeks to create an affordable mobile application (app) that focuses on the application of mathematical concepts to biological problems. This research will develop, test, and evaluate a novel, low cost, independent app to facilitate the teaching of biology application problems and to enhance student quantitative literacy. Both the content and the app will be developed by students from underrepresented groups, with subject matter expert oversight. It is expected that this app will increase student engagement which will contribute to greater student success in performing biology application problems. This app will help students improve math competency at their own pace, and allow the professor to help them at the point where they are having difficulty. Thus, this app will improve faculty ability to address one important stumbling block that can prevent students from continuing in STEM fields. One expected benefit of wide scale use of this app is increased retention of students in STEM majors.<br/><br/>The proposed project's overall goal is to provide students with learning opportunities to apply mathematical concepts to life science problems and to provide instructors with real time information on student learning outcomes through the development and validation of a low cost interactive math app. To achieve this goal: 1) students will be recruited to assist in development of the app, 2) student focus groups will be formed to test app content and provide feedback, 3) math and biology faculty will be recruited to develop curricular modules that incorporate the app, and 4) the app will be evaluated in three Biology courses. The features of the app, including multiple levels of difficulty, tutorials, sample problems, and feedback to students and instructors coupled with the extensive question bank, will assist in strengthening the quantitative literacy of students at a wide range of universities."

The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs.<br/><br/>The TAMU Alliance is a collaboration between five doctoral degree granting institutions who are members of the Texas A&M University System, to advance URMs around the unifying theme of Energy and Sustainability.   The collaborating institutions include: Texas A&M University Main Campus (TAMUMC), Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMU-K), Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU), West Texas A&M University (WTAMU), and Texas A&M University Corpus Christi (TAMUCC).  These institutions are engaging the following non-doctoral degree institutions who are also members of the Texas A&M University System:  Texas A&M International University (TAMUI), Texas A&M-San Antonio (TAMUSA), Texas A&M-Texarkana (TAMUT), Tarleton State University (TSU), and Texas A&M-Commerce (TAMUC).  <br/><br/>The vision of the collaboration is to develop an AGEP Alliance that opens multiple paths to the doctorate and professoriate for underrepresented minority (URM) populations by successfully developing and sustaining large-scale, distributed, yet interconnected STEM communities among the diverse Alliance institutions that increase participation, reduce barriers, and promote success of URM doctoral students preparing for careers in the professoriate.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of the TAMU AGEP Alliance is to increase the number of successful URM STEM faculty by measurably increasing the number of STEM doctoral degrees awarded to URM students each year and increasing the number of underrepresented minorities (URMs) transitioning to STEM faculty positions (or to competitive postdocs that lead to faculty positions).<br/><br/>The short-term operational goal of the TAMU AGEP Alliance is to develop, implement and assess a set of transportable strategies to ultimately increase the number of successful URM STEM faculty by increasing the number of URMs who enter participating doctoral programs, the percentage of URMs completing STEM doctoral degrees, and the number who transition to faculty positions (or to competitive postdoctoral positions), and by reducing their time to doctoral degree.<br/><br/>There are four defined objectives for the TAMU AGEP Alliance participants, who are all U.S. citizens, who are URMs in STEM.   The Alliance defines a student participant as an URM U.S. citizen, with a demonstrated interest in energy and sustainability, who is classified as a doctoral or master degree student.  Objectives follow:<br/>Objective 1. Increase the number of URMs entering STEM doctoral degree programs at the five collaborating TAMU AGEP institutions.<br/>Objective 2. Reduce the average time to degree for the TAMU AGEP Alliance URM STEM doctoral students, and increase the percentage of students across the Alliance completing their doctoral degree in five years.<br/>Objective 3. Provide the TAMU AGEP Alliance students with the preparation necessary to compete for faculty positions and increase the number of URMs transitioning from STEM Ph.D. programs to faculty or competitive postdoctoral positions.<br/>Objective 4. Foster TAMU research collaborations to support Alliance-wide collaboration with undergraduate, master's and PhD student researchers that will result in an increase in the number of URM STEM doctoral research dissertations co-advised by faculty from at least 2 partner institutions.<br/><br/>The interventions that form the model for the TAMU AGEP Alliance include: joint institutional recruitment of URM doctoral STEM students; participation of institutions and prospective students in an annual alliance conference; use of regional travel, a virtual social network, and webinars to provide community building and joint mentoring opportunities for AGEP doctoral students; student retention stipends based on level of project participation and timely progress toward degree; student participation in research and professional development training conferences, a mini-grant competition for research seed funding, a learning community, and transitioning activities for post-doctoral fellowship placement and/or faculty positions; and engage faculty in cross-institutional collaborations and partnerships with the NSF-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN-SEES): Climate, Energy, Environment and Engagement in Semiarid Regions (CE3SAR).<br/><br/>The TAMU AGEP Alliance social science research study focuses on two questions related to feelings of inclusion of URM STEM graduate students at each of the Alliance institutions in both experimental and applied settings: <br/>1) What effect does experiencing isolation or ostracism have on the productivity and progress of URM STEM graduate students and their intentions to continue to the professoriate? <br/>2) What factors (e.g., institutional, interpersonal, individual) promote or mediate against URM STEM students' experiencing feelings of isolation or ostracism?"

Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy, practice, culture, and organizational climate.  The ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) academic workforce.<br/><br/>Villanova University (VU) is in a time of transition in leadership, strategic priority, and most importantly to its new national status as a Doctoral Research University.  The PIs propose to intentionally manage this transition to ensure that faculty, specifically STEM female and underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, flourish in the changing climate.  Three main thrusts will be orchestrated to accomplish their goals.  The first thrust, change management, will include retreats for administrators with a special focus on diversity and inclusion and faculty workshops focused on resilience during change.  Hiring, promotion, and assessment, the second thrust, will include diversity statements for job candidates; diversity and inclusion goals; funds for bringing candidates to campus; broad stakeholder bias training; and policy review for bias.  The final thrust, improving the culture for diversity, inclusion, and equity, will include administrator and faculty workshops on creating a diverse and equitable culture; workshops on allies, inclusive classrooms, and microaggressions; the expansion of intersectional conversations for faculty; leadership activities;  Employee Resource Groups (ERGs); and the training and support of faculty allies.  This ADVANCE IT project will result in new strategies to ensure equity for all STEM faculty during institutional transitions to increased research expectations of faculty.  . <br/><br/>As part of the Villanova ADVANCE IT project, research on the effects of chairperson mindfulness training on departmental climate will be conducted. Biases are especially prevalent when people engage in automatic rather than controlled thinking and automatic thinking is more likely when psychological resources are low such as when people are coping with stress.  Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is at the cutting edge of psychological research and practice.  Given these elements, the proposed research intends to measure the impact of mindfulness training of department chairpersons' stress and the potential change in departmental climate from the perspective of departmental stakeholders.  The use of a randomized control group makes the experiment especially powerful as a way to isolate the effects of this training on departmental climate.  Furthermore, given the centrality of the academic department to institutional change during the transition to increasing research expectations of faculty, this focus is especially promising.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A diverse network of Patriot League Institutions will be involved: Lehigh University, Georgetown University, Bucknell University, Lafayette College, and the United States Military Academy.  These small to mid-sized universities represent a range of missions, Carnegie classifications, geographies, and organizational structures.  This project will address gaps in mentor structures and practices by establishing Faculty Success Fellowships for two cohorts of eligible associate professor women in STEM across the network.  The program includes a peer-mentoring component that includes faculty from across the network of institutions to expand the faculty peer network.  Expected outcomes include: improved perceptions of mentoring and support; improved measures of career satisfaction and progress; enhanced mentoring skills; and campus leaders with understanding about how to align promotion expectations with requirements.<br/><br/>This project is specifically designed to address the many reasons that STEM women faculty remain at associate professor rank longer than men, 1 to 3 years, or 24.2% more, before promotion to full professor (Bilimoira, 2011; MLA 2009; Buch, 2011).  Some of the reasons are tied to inequitable mentoring at the associate faculty level (Buch, 2011).  The intervention is adapted from Lehigh's ADVANCE program, strengthened with information from previous ADVANCE programs, and uniquely refined to each institution's context by local implementation teams.  The Fellowships permit faculty to design and implement a mentored resourced plan of action leading to early success.  The vertical mentoring structure will be reinforced with a peer-to-peer mentoring component to minimize isolation, foster accountability, increase their support networking, provide outside perspectives, and encourage future collaborations.  Administrative leadership (Deans and Department Chairs, as appropriate) is essential to success; the proposal supports their inclusion through ongoing communication.  The iterative evaluation provides insight into existing and evolving attitudes about mentoring, facilitates knowledge about implementation process, and will improve trainings.  The findings will create and advance knowledge about the design and implementation of mentoring programs for mid-career success of women faculty in STEM.  This project will strengthen our understanding of how best to support associate professor faculty to full professor, where most higher education leaders emerge.  <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.

Already by school entry, children display striking individual differences in math skills that can set them on a path for high or low math performance and participation in STEM disciplines. Latino children, who are disproportionately from low-SES households, are largely vulnerable to delays in math in the school years relative to non-Latino white children, making it urgent to examine when and why this gap emerges. To this end, this project will examine the early math skills of 300 Latino and non-Latino White toddlers and their relation to the quantity and quality of math-related learning opportunities that mothers and fathers provide for their children during everyday interactions. In addition, mothers' and fathers' math abilities, attitudes toward math, and beliefs about the importance of math for children will be examined to determine which of these factors may explain variation in the provision of math-related learning opportunities in the home. Findings of this project will be communicated to educators, practitioners working with parents, staff at community agencies, and parents of young children. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, research on workforce development, and research on broadening participation. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to advance science on early math cognition and aspects of the home environment that support math learning across three core systems: (1) the approximate number system (ANS), an imprecise, nonsymbolic representation of number, (2) the exact number system, a precise, symbolic representation of number, and (3) spatial math, a system that represents shapes, space, and relations among objects in space. These core systems of math are building blocks to mathematical cognition throughout the lifespan. This project will investigate core math skills in toddlers from Latino and non-Latino white backgrounds and the factors that contribute to individual differences. In a sample varying in ethnicity and SES, investigators will describe individual differences in mathematical cognition in 2- to 3-year-olds from Latino and non-Latino white backgrounds, document the roles of mothers' and fathers' math-related practices in children's math skills using new video coding tools and measure, test associations between parenting practices and toddler math skills, and identify the factors that explain variations in mothers' and fathers' math-related practices. This project will inform the design of interventions to support emerging math skills and address the participation of members of groups underrepresented in STEM related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project at St. Philip's College (SPC), a minority-serving institution designated as both a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), seeks to recruit, retain and provide math acceleration for first time in college (FTIC) students. SPC's students face many challenges to post-secondary educational success and unfortunately, only a small percentage of students enroll and succeed in STEM courses. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Enrichment by Design (STEMed) project will address the need for low entry students to improve their pathway to a successful STEM education. This project will allow students to move into college-level mathematics courses sooner than usual, therefore graduating earlier. This reduction in obstacles will increase the number of students graduating from SPC, transferring to a 4 year institution and continuing their STEM education, and/or entering the workforce. While SPC improves its developmental math and STEM programs, STEM students from diverse backgrounds will increasingly obtain a quality education. The local community and the nation will benefit from the increase in these future STEM professionals in the workplace.<br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of the STEMed project is to decrease the time FTIC students take to complete their STEM degree and graduate by focusing on recruiting, retaining, and accelerating FTIC STEM students through developmental math. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) recruit FTIC STEM students from San Antonio Independent School District and SPC's Veteran's Office; 2) implement the Accelerated Math Preparation (AMP) Program to help FTIC STEM students advance into college level math; (3) provide Student Incentive Stipends (SIS) for those in financial need who complete the program; and 4) mentor students until graduation and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The expected outcomes are to decrease degree completion time and increase the number of STEM degree graduates."

Oregon State University (OSU) will create an equitable work environment for women and others from traditionally underrepresented groups through a series of new and unique programs.  These programs will focus on educating university faculty and administrators about how gender, race/ethnicity, and social class combine to disadvantage women in academic Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The centerpiece will be a new program called Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) where faculty will be educated on how gender-based inequality in the workplace can be removed through changing our behaviors.  Activities aimed at recognizing and reducing discrimination of women and underrepresented groups in STEM can be used at other universities.<br/><br/>The goal of OREGON STATE ADVANCE is to transform the institution's climate, structures, and relationships to create an equitable and just workplace.  OREGON STATE ADVANCE will institutionalize supportive policies and processes and revolutionize understandings, relationships, and practices by fostering greater comprehension of the roles difference and power play in social institutions.  Progression toward this goal will be guided by three major objectives: (1) Recruit, retain, and promote more women STEM faculty across the majority of OSU's Colleges by building upon established initiatives and implementing new policies and programs that will lead to a significant increase of women STEM faculty at OSU; (2) Recognize the importance of gender's intersections with race/ethnicity, social class, and other axes of oppression in affecting women's lives; (3) Develop OSU's Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) faculty development program to provide targeted educational opportunities for STEM faculty and administrators.  Theorists have developed a well-defined understanding of systems of oppression.  OREGON STATE ADVANCE operationalizes these theories within an effort to transform the institution through changing behavior, relationships, policies, procedures, and structures. Additionally, researchers have found that ""sense-making"" activities further institutional transformation. This project will examine the impact of utilizing systems of oppression theories as a way of helping administrators and faculty understand the ways difference, power, and privilege construct institutional experiences, disadvantaging women in STEM fields.  Additionally, the project assesses the effects of understanding oppression on institutional transformation and an improved climate for women in STEM.  In very tangible terms, the availability of OREGON STATE ADVANCE individuals and teams to lead DPD seminars at other institutions and the provision of summer institutes and online support resources offer an opportunity for widespread influence for the project.  Additionally, the development of a peer-reviewed online ADVANCE journal will further disseminate ADVANCE findings, as well as other research on women and other underrepresented groups in STEM."

The project will create systemic institutional change by scaling up the levels of awareness about and interventions used to address implicit bias in scientific research and learning settings. The University of New Hampshire UNH, working with three partner institutions, Ohio State University, University of Virginia, and University of California at Irvine, will use rigorous research methods to develop and scale up the evidence-based, interactive intervention resources. Once developed and piloted at these institutions, the bias awareness guide and intervention tool will be distributed nationally. Information about the awareness tool and decision guide for addressing bias incidents will also be distributed broadly via professional associations such as The Association for Women in Science.<br/><br/>The research methodologies for developing this bias awareness guide and decision tool include the collection of extensive information from faculty across the partnering institutions. Thus, the partnership enables the project leaders to oversample STEM faculty whose personal backgrounds fit multiple underrepresented categories. In so doing, the researchers are able to incorporate rank and social identity differences between persons potentially acting in implicitly biased ways as well as rank and social identity differences among those on the receiving end of bias incidents. The project therefore captures intersectionality of faculty whose actions reinforce or disrupt barriers to equality as well as the intersectionality of those who must navigate equity barriers. Research conducted at the University of New Hampshire as part of its ADVANCE IT program confirms that bias incidents in the academic workplace create a negative climate for STEM women faculty and for other faculty with minority status in their respective fields. Negative climate, their research also shows, has a significant negative impact on STEM women faculty members' job satisfaction and increases their intention to quit. Prior research also shows that the greater faculty members' beliefs in their colleagues' propensity to intervene when bias incidents occur, the lower the impact of bias incidents on workplace climate. Thus, increasing both faculty members' awareness of bias incidents and individual skills for addressing bias incidents when they occur helps to maximize positive workplace climate outcomes. The project's novel contributions also include the use of video vignettes to accurately contextualize intersectional faculty experiences, which will in turn enable the multiple institutions who adopt the bias awareness and intervention tools to raise awareness about and propensity for intervening in bias incidents of multiple kinds and in multiple contexts across their institutions. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of women faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate."

The project seeks to investigate the dynamics of active matter systems. The research crosses the fields of mathematics, physics, and biology. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of biophysics courses. The project will also contribute to the development of a Biological Physics Concentration at the university.<br/><br/>Unlike ensembles traditionally discussed in Statistical Mechanics research, active matter systems consist of objects that consume energy and propel themselves, and thus are never in equilibrium.  Building on the discovery of bull sperm collective dynamics in viscoelastic fluids, this project focuses on using experiments to quantify and understand the phenomenology of phase separation in active matter systems.  The primary objective of this project is to map out the coexistence curve of clustered and isolated phases. The research goal will be approached by two methods: a ""pressure"" based method that involves building a microfluidic device to increase cell density, and a ""temperature"" based method, in which the relative strengths of alignment and randomizing factors are tuned by changing fluid properties.  Findings from this project will answer fundamental thermodynamics questions, such as how to quantify parameters like pressure or temperature in a living active matter system, and how to formulate an equivalent equation of state.  Moreover, since viscoelastic fluids are naturally present in the mammalian female reproductive tract, this project would also help to understand the regulation and mechanisms of sperm movement.  The results provide underlying basic science knowledge that could potentially be used to improve animal husbandry."

The goal of this project is to define how host environment impacts global gene expression in a model species of Streptococcus: S. parauberis. This will be accomplished by: 1) establishing the set of genes that are differentially expressed during growth of S. parauberis at temperatures mimicking a mammalian (bovine) host and in a fish host; and 2) establishing the set of genes that are differentially expressed during growth of S. parauberis in serum from a mammalian (bovine) host and from a fish host. This project could help determine the mechanisms by which Streptococcal bacteria adapt to their host environment and will contribute to our knowledge base regarding the basic cellular processes that support microbial survival.

With support from the National Science Foundation, the Collaborative for the Advancement of STEM Leadership (CASL) aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM through a targeted focus on leadership. This collaborative project embraces a more expanded position of creating new knowledge about the relationship between leadership and broadening participation, and transferring that knowledge into institutional practices that can be promulgated through a national community of practice. Initially, the impact of the Collaborative will be among select HBCUs, but, because of its broad reach into mainstream STEM reform communities, these efforts will eventually impact all institutional types and address the growing need for quality leadership for broadening participation in STEM. As a result, tens of thousands of underrepresented minority STEM students, enrolled at both HBCUs and non-HBCU campuses, will experience the kind of academic environments that are most conducive to their learning and persisting as STEM majors.<br/><br/>The goal of CASL is to establish the foundational tenets of the research and practice of leadership for broadening participation in STEM. The Collaborative will achieve this mission through: 1) research activities that will contribute to an increased knowledge base on leadership development for broadening participation in STEM; 2) knowledge translation activities that will use an evidence-based approach to leadership development to increase the number of HBCU leaders with culturally responsive competencies and capacities; and 3) outreach activities that will develop a national Community of Practice to define, codify, and promulgate design principles and practices for broadening participation and thereby increase the visibility/influence of HBCUs at the center of STEM higher education reform. The distributed structure of the Collaborative lends itself to the development and sustainability of an integrated discovery analytical framework that serves two primary purposes: 1) it provides robustness and flexibility in facilitating exploratory and emergent lines of inquiry that directly address research questions about the relationship between leadership and broadening participation in STEM; and 2) it facilitates an iterative and dynamic approach by supporting the integration of new insights and research questions that emerge over the project's duration into the Collaborative's ongoing activities, and vice versa."

Gaining an understanding how small molecule affect this protein can help scientists understand and control cell death. Undergraduate students will gain research experience in organic synthesis and biochemistry. <br/><br/>The cell has many adaptive mechanisms used for the cellular repair during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. If proteostasis is not re-established, unfolded proteins are tagged for clearance through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Aberrant cells have been shown to exploit these prosurvival mechanisms as a way to circumvent cell death. However proteasome disruption leads to cell death. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a key component of the UPS which may be targeted to investigate its role in proteostasis. Small molecule heterocycles such as imidazoles have the potential to allosterically bind to VCP to disrupt the UPS in rogue cells. The utilization of a two-step synthesis of a library of novel imidazole compounds through microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions will allow a variety of imidazole compounds to be rapidly synthesized.

Specifically, SNNA-LSAMP will provide these students with intensive, near-peer mentoring; out-of-class STEM activities that enhance disciplinary socialization; undergraduate research opportunities; internships; priority registration for enrollment in STEM courses; and priority access to all academic support services provided on alliance campuses. Furthermore, SNNA-LSAMP will facilitate the smooth transitions for participants transferring from its community colleges to its universities, as well as provide upper-division participants with step-by-step guidance through the process of applying to graduate school. SNNA-LSAMP will improve the STEM classroom experience for URM students by providing workshops that enhance the multicultural competence of professors and instructors at alliance institutions. Consequently, SNNA-LSAMP will be a vital component of efforts to diversify and significantly expand the pool of highly qualified STEM workers in southern Nevada and northern Arizona, accelerating the region's ongoing transformation into fertile ground for STEM startups and will be an attractive destination for established STEM-based businesses seeking to relocate."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. The need for cultivating STEM talent has been well established. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. American students from diverse ethnic groups are underrepresented in STEM fields, and represent an untapped resource for the STEM workforce in the U.S. The Indiana STEM LSAMP (IN STEM LSAMP), which consists of three research institutions: Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (lead institution), Indiana University Bloomington and Ball State University; two four-year regional universities: Indiana University Northwest and Indiana University South Bend; and Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis, will address the critical need of increasing the participation and advancement of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines through its comprehensive and holistic plan that is built upon the elements of the LSAMP Model (academic integration, social integration and professionalization). <br/><br/>IN STEM LSAMP activities will result in significant increases of STEM degree holders among historically underrepresented racial/ethnic populations in Indiana and the nation by providing these students access to faculty research mentoring, academic support, and STEM-related professionalization. To achieve alliance goals, all IN STEM LSAMP partners will implement the following cohesive high-impact practices to increase the retention rate of first-year full-time students and to strengthen students' disciplinary engagement: a) mathematical placement and online review support, b) summer bridge programs, c) freshman learning communities, d) peer mentoring programs, e) degree mapping, f) faculty-mentored research, and g) annual research conference. Additionally, the alliance will facilitate seamless transitions into STEM undergraduate and graduate degree programs by i) increasing program activities for community college transfers and ii) improving undergraduate disciplinary connections and preparation for STEM graduate programs. The project will generate new knowledge regarding the relative contributions of the selected high-impact practices to the academic success of underrepresented students. Additional new knowledge will be gained regarding the efficacy of pre-transfer programming at community colleges and STEM degree program collaborations for success in the retention and graduation of underrepresented students in STEM fields at the four-year college level. The alliance's accomplishments will have widespread effects beyond the region as its talented STEM graduates enter national research and development enterprises and thus, will diversify the STEM workforce of the U.S."

Careful evaluation is expected to expand understanding of such initiatives in a disciplinary context. <br/><br/>The ADVOCATE FORWARD project is designed to improve the recruitment, retention, promotion, and sustainability of women faculty in engineering.  North Dakota State University (NDSU), through its ADVANCE program, developed and implemented a signature program called Advocates & Allies (A&A) designed to improve gender equity through the direct and proactive engagement of male faculty.  The program is comprised of two-parts: Advocates, senior male faculty who educate themselves about issues of gender [in]equality; and Allies, male faculty whom the Advocates train as proponents for gender equity in their departments.  These men serve as change agents, committing to be active and vocal proponents of gender diversity and equality specifically in terms of increasing the number of female faculty, encouraging the hiring and promotion of female faculty in administrative positions, and ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of women within their units.  NDSU has seen increased participation of women in all science and engineering faculty and academic administrative positions as a result of its ADVANCE project and the A&A program has been endorsed as a model program by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).  This project will test, refine, and grow the program into a national model.  The core adaptation and implementation network partners include: NDSU; the Ohio State University; the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of North Texas, and the University of Wyoming.  This project has the potential to lead to the adoption of the A&A as a national model by ASEE following implementation and adaptation of the program by the network partners.  This project will provide evidentiary support of how male advocates and allies can uniquely assist engineering programs in attracting and retaining more women faculty.  In so doing, it will help grow a large cadre of faculty leaders trained as advocates and allies to advance the number of women (at all levels) in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will shed new light on the role, function, and utility of developing and implementing gendered-faculty advocate and ally groups in higher education as a means to advance efforts to support women faculty in STEM, particularly in engineering.  Research on male faculty advocates and allies is virtually nonexistent.  Most of the work in the area of ally groups in higher education has focused on male students or gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered support groups.  The project goals include: (1) acquire new knowledge on the development and implementation of faculty advocate and ally groups in higher education as a means to improve climate for all faculty and women faculty in engineering in particular; (2) demonstrate the efficacy of advocates and allies in promoting gender equality and equity; and (3) become a fully established, self-sustaining locus of research, training, and support in proactively engaging men in gender equity efforts in schools of engineering across the country.  The partner institutions offer a unique mix of characteristics: public/private, ADVANCE/non-ADVANCE, PhD/non-PhD granting, small/large, wide regional representation, and broad ethnic and gender diversity.  These varied characteristics are essential to identifying and developing broadly applicable implementation models and training.  This project focuses on engineering disciplines where there are a declining number of women studying and earning advanced degrees and more Ph.D. trained women are opting not to seek jobs in academia. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers."

AccessINCLUDES links to the NSF INCLUDES Network by sharing knowledge and results from NSF disability-focused projects and their network organizations to better prepare the NSF INCLUDES National Network to: 1. address disability-related issues in their research (e.g., design interventions to be accessible; recruit, support, and report outcomes for participants with disabilities); 2. make meetings, trainings, courses, and other project activities welcoming and accessible to individuals with disabilities; 3. design project resources and products to be accessible to individuals with disabilities; and 4. develop durable, new collaborations between multiple stakeholders and organizations that lead to future innovative projects and resources that are inclusive of individuals with disabilities. Ultimately, including more individuals with disabilities in STEM fields broadens participation and enhances these fields with their unique perspectives and expertise.<br/><br/>Individuals with disabilities inform all aspects of the project. Participants include (1) current and future NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Projects, Alliances, and the Coordination Hub, and (2) disability-focused broadening participation. All project activities support and disseminate outcomes from three conferences, one two-day on-site and two half-day webinars, all designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Conference participants engage in an online community of practice focused on the project goal and objectives and conference development. In the conferences AccessINCLUDES participants, informed by research and practice with respect to broadening participation; STEM, disabilities, change management, and organizational development, advance knowledge relevant to increasing the success of individuals with disabilities through research, instruction, activities, and products of NSF INCLUDES projects. Resources collected and developed and the two dissemination webinars are tailored to the needs of the NSF INCLUDES National Network, so that they have lasting value for making Network projects more inclusive of individuals with disabilities. The project ensures long-term impact by building on two associations, NSF INCLUDES projects and NSF-funded disability-focused projects, and creating durable relationships among projects that enhance the infrastructure for STEM broadening participation research and practice; increasing the participation of people with disabilities in STEM; and disseminating transformational research and practice to enhance understanding and promote replication and impact in the NSF INCLUDES National Network and other STEM and disability-focused organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Careful evaluation is expected to expand understanding of such initiatives across institutions and institution types.<br/><br/>This project will focus on producing policy changes to support gender equity and create culture change within the South Dakota state university system.  This project will include six institutions: South Dakota State University (SDSU), the University of South Dakota, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Northern State University, Dakota State University, and Black Hills State University.  This project has system wide leadership commitment and involves teams of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in the policy review and development.  The model, if successful, could be adapted to other higher education systems.  It is expected that this project will result in: evidence of effective top-down change mechanisms in higher education; amended or new policies that promote gender equity in STEM; and contributions to the research on processes for systemic change in higher education.<br/><br/>This project will test the proposition that the central establishment of equity policy and indicators at the system level is required not only to demonstrate improvement in diversity but to actualize it (Blackmore, 2011; Castilla, 2008; Kalev, Kelly and Dobbin, 2006).  Research from industry indicates the effectiveness of ""top-down"" change for increased gender equity.  By implementing and assessing this process in academia, new evidence and subsequent models for centralized change will be produced for use beyond this state system.  In this project, Scott's model (1987) of change is used to demonstrate that change is most effectively implemented through policy driven by a central authority.  The project will expand and assess understanding of the probability of gender equity improvement in higher education state systems through policy implementation by a centralized authority.  This work will also establish evidence for how centralized policies can change individual faculty assessment practices across a higher education system, linking the system and institutional level in Scott's theory of change.  In addition, this project will contribute to the knowledge base on how centralized policies can change individual norms in career planning and aspirations, linking the system, institutional, and individual level in Scott's theory of change.  This project builds on previous ADVANCE work at the University of Maryland in policy analysis, and work completed at Montana State University to solicit policy innovation. <br/><br/>The ADVANCE PLAN program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers."

The CREST-PRF research project titled ""Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Confined Fluids Using Nitrogen Vacancy Centers"" aligns with the goals of the PRF program and the CREST Center for Interface Design and Engineered Assembly of Low-Dimensional Systems (IDEALS) at CUNY City College of New York, where it is housed. The project's work focuses on the study of fluid dynamics at nanoscale volumes, an area of research of broad interest across scientific disciplines and with a high potential to generate benefits to society. Collaborations with other researchers, in both international and domestic laboratories, will enhance the progress of the work. Outreach to area schools will provide opportunities for high school students to be exposed to cutting edge STEM research.<br/><br/>The project's main goal is the empirical characterization of confined fluids as the dynamic transitions from bulk-dominated to interface-dominated. The work employs a novel technique, utilizing Nitrogen Vacancy Centers (NVCs) in diamonds to confine nanoscale volumes of fluids, to enable their study using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Extending previous work, the superb spin properties and unmatched spatial resolution of NVCs can be used to perform magnetic resonance spectroscopy on fluid volumes orders of magnitude smaller than what is feasible with standard means. With established techniques of dynamic decoupling and correlation spectroscopy, the diffusion dynamics of the fluid of interest can be probed, providing great insight into this poorly understood regime. Experiments with NVCs bring together specialized fields including semiconductor physics, atomic physics, magnetic resonance, quantum optics, and quantum information processing. Knowledge generated and processes developed through the project's work will be broadly applicable to innovations beneficial to society, ranging from energy storage to biomedical technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Renewable Energy and Advanced Materials (CREST-CREAM) at Norfolk State University (NSU). Compared to traditional inorganic semi-conducting materials, soft organic and polymeric semiconducting materials exhibit inherent advantages such as lower cost and less energy consumption on large scale manufacturing. However, the charge generation and transport mechanisms of soft materials are not quite clear and the conversion efficiencies of soft materials are still relatively low on average compared to typical inorganic semiconductors. The major goal of the proposed research is to enable a greater understanding of the fundamental scientific mechanisms and principles behind charge generations, charge transports, and morphological effects of soft organic and polymeric materials. Such research could lead to less expensive, lightweight, flexible, biocompatible, environmentally friendly, and higher performance alternatives to traditional inorganic semi-conducting materials and devices. These future materials/devices can contribute positively and critically to renewable and clean energy technologies, bio-technologies, health care, and therefore can contribute to a more sustainable human population growth. <br/><br/>The specific research objective of this project is to systematically investigate the effects of charge doping on the electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric, and morphological properties of conjugated or semiconducting polymers. In addition to traditional chemical/photo/electrode doping, a relatively novel concept of ""halogen-bonding"" doping will also be systematically investigated and evaluated as an alternative low-cost and convenient method of engineering charge generation, transport and morphological changes in soft organic/polymeric materials.  Halogen bonding is a relatively weak bonding mode similar to hydrogen bonding and may be used to facilitate polymer self-assembly for increased solar cell and device performance. State-of-the-art techniques will be used to characterize potential changes in morphology and to test the final devices constructed from these engineered materials.  This research is expected to generate new knowledge that will be widely disseminated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is critical to understand the experiences of hiring committee members, and of candidates for faculty positions, in order to advance STEM academic hiring practices. Having a more diverse STEM academic workforce contributes to promoting the progress of science.<br/><br/>The project team will investigate whether and, if so, how bias against women creeps into the process of selecting and interviewing tenure-track faculty candidates at a highly ranked public research university. There are three studies: Study 1 analyzes the deployment and outcomes of faculty using evaluation rubrics in the processes of rating candidates and recommending them for interviews and for hire. The research team will compare rubric ratings and outcomes to its own assessment of scholarly production, impact and teaching quality, extracted from candidates' CVs. Also, video-recordings of the candidates' formal job talks will be analyzed to determine social interactions, such as the number and tone of questions and interruptions, which may vary depending on whether the candidate is male or female. Study 2 surveys advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and newly hired faculty to examine if men and women self-report being treated differently during academic STEM interviews, and to determine if men and women react differently to similar interview events such as interrupting. Study 3 surveys early career scholars to determine their perceptions of discipline-specific understandings and stereotypes about merit and how these perceptions may or may not affect how they navigate their own interview processes.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) seeks to advance the research capacity of a biologist by developing a collaboration with a leader in the field of soundscape ecology at Boise State University. The investigator and several minority undergraduate students will work on a research project examining the influence of noise on wildlife. Noise is an important and growing component in both natural and human systems. Anthropogenic sounds, including those from transportation networks, power generation, motorized recreation, urban development, and fossil fuel extraction are loud and pervasive. Remote wilderness areas are not immune and transportation noise is a near universal component of the modern acoustical landscape with noticeable levels of airway, railway, and roadway noise reaching nearly all corners and counties in the continental USA. Meanwhile natural sounds, such as a morning birdsong chorus or the thunder of a mountain river, can be loud and prominent environmental features that are present in virtually all environments. A substantial body of work has revealed that organisms change behaviors and distributions due to noise, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The education and research experiences provided by this project will contribute to WSSU's efforts to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in wildlife biology and also help prepare students for graduate school and the Nation's STEM workforce.<br/><br/><br/>Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain noise avoidance by animals: 1) masking of important auditory information (when the signal and noise acoustically overlap), 2) distraction, a limitation of available processing resources (independent of signal and noise overlap), and 3) noise aversion (associated with a stress response). To tease these hypotheses apart, the researcher and students will conduct a series of lab-based experiments focused on performance and stress in animals foraging in noise. Several species of bats and birds that vary in their reliance on sound for hunting will be pitted against prey in a large flight room. Simultaneously, behavior will be filmed with high-speed cameras and heart-rate, a measure of perception and stress, captured using radio tags. Predators will be trained to locate prey-generated sounds. During the experiments the animals will be observed foraging in quiet control or two noisy soundscape conditions (each with different frequency profiles). If masking is responsible for noise avoidance, then a reduction in foraging success should occur only when the noise overlaps with prey signals. If distraction underlies noise avoidance, foraging deficits will be equal for both noise conditions. However, if aversion explains noise avoidance, a heart rate response will be observed with no decline in foraging success. Understanding the mechanisms driving noise avoidance is critical for the development of sensory ecology theory and anthropogenic noise policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University aims to study the ecological role of predatory bacteria, Bdellovibrio-like organisms (BALOs), in marine waters.  The project outcome can reveal interactions not only amongst the bacterial predators but also among the predators and their prey bacteria under various environmental factors. <br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this study are to: investigate how viruses, Halobacteriovorax, and heterotrophic protists effect one another in decreasing bacterial abundance; quantify the relative proportion of all three mortality mechanisms on bacterial loss; determine environmental effects on predatory activities of protists, viruses, and Halobacteriovorax; and model population dynamics of predators and prey. The approach to accomplishing these objectives is to measure loss rates of a virus, heterotrophic protist, and a Halobacteriovorax on the mortality of bacteria in laboratory microcosms and field studies. The novelty and innovativeness of this approach is that while many of these components have been examined independently, this would be the first time that mortality is quantitatively partitioned for this complex system. The expected high-payoff from this innovative Early-Concept for Exploratory Research project is transformative results that dramatically increase understanding of tri-trophic planktonic interactions that significantly influence oceanic biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nutrients through the microbial loop and reveal Halobacteriovorax as a major bacterial predator."

The project at Norfolk State University aims use a novel optical non-contact cell stretching method to create a controlled stretch in biological cells. Accordingly, the project outcome can unveil mechanisms governing heart electrical abnormalities via modeling and relate the electrophysiological measurements to mechanical stretching by enabling reproducible stretch conditions in vitro to mechanistically characterize various human disorders including heart failure. <br/><br/>Excitable biological cells, such as heart cells, exhibit mechano-electric sensitivity by which their electrical behavior is modulated by mechanical stimuli or stretch. This is especially critical in chronic diseases such as heart failure where increased stress may induce life-threatening abnormalities, called arrhythmias. Specialized stretch-activated ion channels in cells are thought to be responsible for this phenomenon. However, these channels are not well characterized, partly due to a lack of efficient cell stretching and simultaneous electrical recording techniques. In this project, a novel optical non-contact stretching method, using counter-propagating laser beams, is proposed which is capable of producing a controlled stretch in biological cells in the most realistic condition. A microfluidic platform for performing automated, high throughput electrophysiological recordings from cells will be designed. Tightly focused laser beams will be used to stretch the cells while simultaneously performing the patch clamp recordings. The proposed optofluidic chip will be used to systematically characterize the stretch-activated ion channels in cardiac cells. The experiments combined with advanced computer-based modeling will provide useful insights into the mechanisms of arrhythmias in heart failure conditions. The cell-stretching technique could be extended to study several other diseases such as cancer, brain tumors, Parkinson disease and even plant disorders. <br/><br/>This EAGER project is funded by the Engineering Directorate."

Mathematics and science faculty will collaborate first to revise the College Algebra course which serves the majority of entering STEM freshman. They will then adapt the approach to Trigonometry and Calculus I, the mathematics courses STEM students take after completing College Algebra. This project will produce an empirically based model that bridges the gap in student preparation between developmental and college-level mathematics coursework, as well as link professional development with changes in instructional practices and students' mathematical practices at the college level. The project will examine undergraduate students' mathematics learning and achievement in the context of a historically black university, where 81% of the undergraduate students are from racial and ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM.

These core systems of math are building blocks to mathematical cognition throughout the lifespan. This project will investigate core math skills in toddlers from Latino and non-Latino white backgrounds and the factors that contribute to individual differences. In a sample varying in ethnicity and SES, investigators will describe individual differences in mathematical cognition in 2- to 3-year-olds from Latino and non-Latino white backgrounds, document the roles of mothers' and fathers' math-related practices in children's math skills using new video coding tools and measure, test associations between parenting practices and toddler math skills, and identify the factors that explain variations in mothers' and fathers' math-related practices. This project will inform the design of interventions to support emerging math skills and address the participation of members of groups underrepresented in STEM related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Center goal is to enhance knowledge of basic properties and environmental characteristics, toxicity, and applications of nanomaterials. There is a compelling need for studying potential toxicity of nanomaterials and advancing efficient, fast and inexpensive computational approaches to predict toxicity of new species. Understanding of structures, characteristics and biological activities of man-made nanomaterials is critical to prediction of their impacts on the environment and human health. Nanoparticle exposure is common, but short- and long-term exposure effects are currently not fully understood, especially since the primary and agglomerate sizes, surface area, and the characteristics of the surface play such important roles. Conversely, nanotechnology can also be used to create new nanomedicines, sensors, pollutant filters and catalysts with important societal benefits.<br/><br/>The Interdisciplinary Nanotoxicity Center focuses on two research subprojects: addressing nanomaterials discovery and deployment. Subproject 1 focuses on multifunctional nanoparticles and their model counterparts: structures, properties, interaction with environment and applications. The aim of this project is to systematically study structure, energetics and optics of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles and their bioconjugates in various environments. Multifunctional environmental safe magnetic core-plasmonic shell nanopaticle based assay for the detection of toxic pathogens selectively from water will be designed and developed, and the possible use of multifunctional nanoparticles for selective removal of toxic pathogens from drinking water is investigated.  <br/><br/> Subproject 2 investigates toxicity of nanoparticles as a function of environmental factors: experimental studies and computational modeling to include different aspects of the development and production of nanomaterials and investigation of their toxicity. The overarching goal is to develop an operational model for directing production of green metal oxide nanoparticles and to conduct in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies under selected environmental conditions by using engineered metal oxide nanoparticles of controlled size and shape. In addition, computational studies are carried out to develop reliable computational models effective for prediction of physico-chemical characteristics and toxicity of nanomaterials. <br/><br/>Both research areas are strongly interconnected and designed to enhance knowledge of basic properties and environmental characteristics, toxicity, and applications of nanomaterials. The Center utilizes the Universal Design for Learning model to maximize learning outputs of diverse student populations."

With support from the National Science Foundation, Fielding Graduate University, in partnership with the Society of STEM Women of Color, Inc., proposes to enhance and implement the STEM Women of Color Conclave as a Broadening Participation Workshop series that will facilitate the preparation of a cadre of its participants for academic leadership roles. GPRA Strategic Management, Inc. (GPRASMi) will serve as the collaborative organizational partner in implementing the proposed Conclave Workshops. This effort will foster a strategic collaboration and provide access to formal postgraduate training in leadership studies. The overall goal of this effort is to increase the representation of STEM women of color in academic leadership positions by enhancing the quality of the leadership development experience. The proposed Conclave Workshops will heighten the profile of STEM women faculty of color who, in turn, will constitute a powerful knowledge network for broadening participation through effective academic leadership. As a long-term outcome, the proposed leadership development experience for women of color is likely to yield a cadre of academic leaders with the acumen needed to address the shifting demands of higher education, and the cultural sensitivity to yield academic success and better STEM career outcomes, particularly among underrepresented minorities.  As such, the proposed Workshops will extend beyond the leadership capacity of its participants to the thousands of underrepresented minority students with whom they will interact.<br/><br/>The proposed project will enhance the leadership development experience for women of color who provide the kind of academic and psychosocial support for underrepresented minority students that leads to better STEM learning outcomes by: 1) convening broadening participation workshops focused on leadership development for STEM women of color; and 2) providing access to opportunities to earn continuing education credits as credentials necessary for acquiring legitimacy in and contributing to STEM academic leadership. The specific objectives are: 1) to convene a two-day Broadening Participation Workshop: National Conclave for STEM Women of Color; and 2) to provide access to continuing education (CE) credits for Conclave participants. This project will contribute to redefining higher education leadership to meaningfully include an awareness of, affinity for, and sensitivity to the academic and psychosocial needs of underrepresented minority students, thereby broadening participation. Collectively, these efforts are expected to impact a network of thousands of STEM higher education reformers committed to diversifying STEM faculty, as well as a wider pool of faculty and academic administrators, from all disciplines, who are committed to recruiting and retaining STEM women faculty of color."

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Paine College will conduct research on the role that rainfall plays in mobilizing bacterial pathogens which are linked to human health. The project will help build the research capacity at Paine College and will have a major impact on a large population of minority students. The research opportunities and modification of existing curricular offerings will provide undergraduate students with advanced skills in environmental science and enhance teaching and learning at Paine College. In addition, Paine College will enhance its outreach activities to the community by training students majoring in Education who will develop an online teaching module for high schools.  <br/><br/>The project will integrate water quality surveillance, microcosm studies, environmental sampling, traditional culturing and quantitative molecular analysis to assess the ecological implications of rainfall events on mobilization of four opportunistic enteric pathogens and elicitation of acid stress response (ASR) within a freshwater floodplain. The principle objectives are to: 1) characterize the role of rainfall events in mobilization of sediment associated bacterial communities into a seasonal wetland, and 2) characterize ASR elicitation of the bacterial community within a wetland and riverine system. Findings from this work will strengthen understanding of bacterial community structure and function in aquatic ecosystems, may aid in identification of seasonal environmental ""hot spots"" of bacterial pathogenicity and may transform paradigms of seasonally influenced bacterial diseases. This project has the potential to transform current mechanistic linkages of opportunistic pathogen mobilization into seasonal wetlands and the contributions of these aquatic ecosystems in conditioning bacterial pathogenicity and community structure."

TCUP's funding of projects that address these goals expands opportunities for Native people to pursue challenging degrees and rewarding careers in STEM, to conduct research studies on culturally significant topics, and fosters generational appreciation for STEM education. In alignment with TCUP's goals, United Tribes Technical College has initiated a research study focusing on renewable energy production. The project will work to develop a more efficient method for reforming biogas into a renewable energy source that can be generated from organic waste materials. The production of renewable hydrogen offers many options for power generation, as well as potential conversion of hydrogen to renewable ammonia for use as fuel or fertilizer. Given the large number of farm and ranch operations in North Dakota and the Northern Plains states in general, the project is highly relevant and holds potential benefits for the region.<br/><br/>The project will examine reforming of methane to hydrogen and carbon dioxide via a combination of steam-methane reforming (water-based) and dry reforming (carbon dioxide-based). Additionally, water-gas shift activity will be designed into the catalysts. This ""mixed"" reforming presents several technical challenges which include coking of the catalyst, incomplete conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and catalyst longevity.

Research collaborations have become an increasingly essential part of a successful career in mathematics.  In theoretical sciences, unlike laboratory sciences, there is no structure in which collaborations and mentor relationships naturally arise.  It is thus critical that women, beginning early in their career, attend research conferences in their area of specialization, interact productively with other participants, and have access to research-based networks.  To facilitate such networks, AWM plans to organize a series of conferences and workshops aimed at fostering research collaborations and building sustainable networks.  These networks will be established at Research Collaboration Conferences for Women (RCCWs), which are week-long conferences, held at mathematics institutes, where junior and senior women come together to work on pre-defined research problems.  AWM will expand the number and scope of the RCCWs and organize a series of follow-up events to help sustain and grow the resulting networks.  Expected outcomes of this project include more invitations to speak at conferences, more collaborative research, a higher level of productivity for the women involved, and decreased attrition.  The networks created by this project will not be static and will welcome new researchers as they enter the field.  <br/><br/>Studies conducted through this project will focus on understanding the effectiveness of research collaboration networks in helping to advance women's research careers to the highest levels of the profession.  By promoting research collaborations and forming networks of women with related research interests, the proposed workshops will help both senior and junior women increase their visibility in and contributions to the research community.  This project will also add to our understanding of the impact of networks and mentor relationships based on shared research interests in addition to shared demographic characteristics.  The research and interactive seminars designed for this project have the potential to become models for future events of this kind and for other theoretical sciences. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers."

The two PDE-components act on separate and adjacent media. Two specific models under consideration are: (1) Fluid-structure interaction (FSI), where the model consists of the Navier Stokes equation coupled on the interface with dynamic elasticity; and  (2) Structure acoustic interaction (SAI), in an acoustic chamber with an elastic or thermoelastic shell as a flexible wall. The SAI model consists of hybrid coupling between an acoustic wave equation and a shell equation which is possibly nonlinear. Control theoretic issues to be studied are: (a) stabilization, particularly stabilization of unstable equilibria in FSI and stabilization of SAI subject to weak dissipation; and (b) well-posedness, particularly seeking suitable feedback control such that the solution to FSI with moving interface is well-posed. Both models could be generalized to other structures where the developed mathematical technology could be applied to other coupled systems."

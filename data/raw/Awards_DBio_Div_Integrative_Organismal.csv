Meanwhile, progress in understanding plant genomes and novel information technologies are transforming the pace, scale, and strategies used to conduct plant science research, allowing, for example, much richer appreciation for the connections among genes, environments, and plant form and function.  These advances in plant science promise to revolutionize crop breeding and help to keep pace with future population growth, environmental pressures, and energy needs.  In the past decade, the Gramene (www.gramene.org) database has served the research community as a portal to information about gene structure and function for multiple plant species.  Tools offered through the Gramene portal allow researchers to develop novel hypotheses on the bases of the most recent information and analyses, using a standardized framework. Yet, there are many remaining opportunities to more fully leverage functional information available from diverse plant species.  In this project, Gramene will substantially expand the number of plant genomes incorporated into the portal, add new capabilities for studying gene expression, pathways, and networks, and fundamentally improve the database architecture and user interfaces to facilitate sophisticated systems-level analyses. At least twenty reference genomes, annotated by the scientists who are studying them and including crop plant, model organism, and other species, will be incorporated into the expanded Gramene portal. Rice, maize, and Arabidopsis will be emphasized through the addition of publicly available data from expression, epigenomic, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A single internationally-coordinated resource for these data types will be maintained through collaboration with the Ensembl Plants project (plants.ensembl.org). To better capture information about the function of plant genes, Gramene will adopt two powerful tools: the Reactome (www.reactome.org) platform, which can be used to represent curated pathways and for performing pathways-based analyses; and the ATLAS (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/) platform, which can be used to display and analyze expression profiles. These interfaces, along with Ensembl, BioMart, and a GWAS viewer, will form an integrated analysis system that is built on structured metadata and implemented through a high-capacity data warehouse and an advanced search engine.<br/><br/>To engage and nurture early career scientists, the project will provide research training opportunities for postdoctoral associates and students at all levels. Training on the use of Gramene tools will be accomplished through presentations and workshops held at internationally attended conferences; broader audiences will be reached through a series of webinars.  Another major objective is to achieve broad interoperability among community resources. Standards development will be accomplished via outreach to collaborative data partners and scientists identified through several NSF-supported Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). Establishing common protocols, vocabularies, and semantics will have the powerful effect of bringing scientists together in research and educational fields, both domestically and abroad. A further objective is to engage biologists who are best qualified in their field to contribute to genome annotations on the basis of experimental evidence. Gramene will hold annual jamborees to train scientists in the use of standard curation tools that produce consistent definitions of data types and metadata. Finally, the ubiquitous publication of peer-reviewed journals online enables new opportunities to better link genome databases with the scientific literature. Gramene will collaborate with the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), publisher of two high-impact journals, to prototype ways to couple collection of structured experimental data to the manuscript acceptance and publication process. As a whole, this project will contribute to long-term progress in merging information sciences with natural sciences that will ultimately lead to positive impacts on technology and society."

Hampton (University of Minnesota-Duluth)<br/><br/>Collaborators: Martin Heil (CINESTAV, Irapuato, Mexico) and Patrick von Aderkas (University of Victoria, Canada)<br/><br/>One-third of all crop species produce floral nectar and are dependent on animals for reproduction. Moreover, crops such as cotton, bean, pea, apple, cherry, peach, and blueberry, all produce extrafloral nectar to attract mutualistic predatory insects, which protect plants from herbivores. U.S. pollinator-dependent crops alone have an annual value of nearly $25 billion, and extrafloral nectar represents one of the few defense mechanisms for which stable effects on plant health and fitness have been demonstrated. This project will employ genomics technologies to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the synthesis and secretion of nectar components across species and nectary types. If successful, this project will provide significant new insight into these processes and the plant-animal interactions mediated by specific nectar components that will allow targeted studies to improve overall pollination efficiency, enhance biological control of pests that attack crops, and have the potential to greatly impact apiculture.  With regard to outreach and training, the project will provide interdisciplinary research training for students and postdoctoral associates. Project graduate students at Iowa State University will also serve as GK12 Fellows in GK12 Symbi program (http://www.gk12.iastate.edu/). Supported by NSF, the Symbi program is a partnership between ISU and middle schools and high schools that serve primarily under-represented students in the Des Moines Public School District. GK12 Fellows will serve as ""resident scientists"" who will work with teachers to develop innovative, hands-on and engaging science activities for select middle school or high school science students.  Finally, the project will also provide research experiences for high school students from Cornell High School (Cornell, Wisconsin).<br/>   <br/>The central hypothesis driving the project is that the genetic programs underlying nectar synthesis, secretion and function are at least partially conserved between diverse species and nectary types. To address this hypothesis, the project will apply comparative genomics approaches to the characterization of the (i) synthesis, (ii) secretion and (iii) biological function of nectar components across a diverse set of core eudicots, including Brassica sp., cotton, tobacco, squash, Lima bean, and acacia. The specific objectives and approaches include:<br/><br/>1. Comparative expression profiling of nectaries throughout the secretory process. Both the floral and extrafloral nectary transcriptomes and proteomes of the respective species will be examined at several time points throughout the secretory process;<br/><br/>2. Comparative metabolomics of nectars. Nectar metabolites will be comprehensively characterized through a non-biased GC-GC/MS-MS and LC/MS-MS approach;<br/><br/>3. Comparative and functional analysis of nectar proteins. Specific arrays of proteins have been reported in several nectars, which confer both protective and attractive properties. Thus, the proteomes of both floral and extrafloral nectars will be defined and functionally characterized across species.; and, <br/><br/>4. Informatics, database building & initiation of mechanistic studies. Mining of global expression data from actively secreting vs. inactive nectaries will allow the identification of genes and cellular processes central to the basal pathways for active nectar secretion across species. Metabolomic data will be linked to activities identified from expression data to assess their impacts on nectar production and composition. <br/><br/>All validated data will subsequently be integrated into an existing public online database (www.nectarygenomics.org), with subsets of data also being made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the iPlant Collaborative (www.iplantcollaborative.org)."

Legumes like soybean annually fix 60 million metric tons of nitrogen, which have a fertilizer replacement value of $7- 10 billion. A long-term goal of N2 fixation research is to transfer the symbiotic ability of legumes to non-legume crops like corn or tomato. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the complex events that occur after the bacteria penetrate the root. These gaps are hindering efforts to engineer nitrogen fixation into non-legumes. Hence, the main objective of this project is to elucidate the initial events that take place during the formation of structures that mediate the movement of bacteria through the root. This project will use high-resolution methods to characterize macromolecular events at a single-cell level. The experimental data will be analyzed with sophisticated modeling tools to improve our understanding of the first events of the legume-bacterial interactions that lead to symbiosis. The knowledge gained will support efforts to transfer the rhizobial symbiosis to non-leguminous plants. In addition to the research mission, the project will create new programs to provide transformative elementary education, as well as training programs for the professional development of middle school and high school teachers. Finally, this project will develop an innovative Sophomore Bioinformatics/Plant Science program to provide integrated training in plant research and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Data integration and system modeling of complex biological processes require detailed, functional genomic data, preferably obtained in a cell-specific way in order to avoid the effects of signal dilution due to the presence of non-responding cells. The long-term goal of this project is to further basic understanding of the agronomically important soybean N2 fixing symbiosis. A unique focus of this project is the ability to sample and analyze the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome at a single-cell resolution. These methods, as well as sophisticated data analysis and modeling tools, will be applied to the intermediate stages of soybean nodulation; specifically, the infection thread progression and bacterial release into nodule cells. These are key events in nodule formation/function that remain largely undefined. The data generated will be used to construct predictive, computational models of the plant response to rhizobial infection thread initiation and growth. The knowledge gained from this research, together with precision breeding techniques, will be instrumental to improving soybean quality and meeting the growing demand for food and fuel expected in the forthcoming years. Moreover, filling in the gaps in our understanding of the rhizobial-legume infection process will be critical to ongoing efforts to transfer this symbiosis to non-leguminous plants (e.g., maize). The project also includes strong outreach programs focusing on the introduction of plant science to elementary, high school and undergraduate students."

The genetic processes that control tassel and ear development also underlie construction of inflorescence architecture across the grasses, including other grain and cereal crops that help feed the world. Thus, understanding the architecture of the maize ear is of especially broad relevance for agricultural research. When water availability is limited during the early growing season, early season drought stress disturbs or blocks maize ear development, which negatively impacts yield. Critical regulators of plant development and networks of gene expression that control distinct steps in generating maize ear architecture have been identified, but how they interact with drought stress is unknown. The project will use current knowledge as a foundation for understanding how two kinds of variation, in natural genetic factors and in the environment in the form of early season drought stress, modulate ear architecture. <br/><br/>Three scientific objectives will be pursued. First, existing high throughput genomics data will be integrated with more traditional breeding data as the basis of a web-accessible database. Serving as a repository for additional project data, and as a resource for queries by standard and specialized analysis tools, the database will thus provide rapid and complex data responses to address a spectrum of biologically relevant questions, including those in the project's second and third research objectives. Second, the nucleotide differences responsible for natural, quantitative genetic variation that controls the complex trait of inflorescence architecture will be elucidated. The project will use genomics tools and resources to identify and clone key genetic factors that have quantifiable effects on inflorescence architecture through their interactions with known genes. These quantitative genes will be integrated into emerging regulatory networks. Third, the mechanisms by which early season drought stress impacts the developmental processes that define the architecture of the maize ear will be identified. Here the project will couple spatial and temporal assessments of ear development to high throughput gene expression profiling. <br/><br/>These drought studies will spearhead interdisciplinary research at the interface of plant stress biology and development. Together the research will establish the molecular basis in maize of what plant breeders have historically called background effects, or the genetic landscape within which genes of major effect act, and illustrate how drought stress alters the timing and execution of endogenous mechanisms that regulate changes in inflorescence architecture. <br/><br/>Previous drought stress studies in maize have mostly focused on mid and late season growth periods, however early season drought stress, which affects the establishment of inflorescence development programs, also leads to substantial reductions in yields. Predicted changes in global climate and expanded cultivation of maize in developing countries will likely increase the impact of early season stress on yields. Understanding the genes and gene interactions that control maize inflorescence development, and how this transcriptional network responds to abiotic stress is necessary to provide the tools for sustaining maize yields. The project will provide insights to the important background effects that breeders seek to understand and address, and can work with. Thus, the research may ultimately be useful to plant breeders selecting for inflorescences that will be more productive in environments where drought stress is encountered. Seed stocks from the project will be available at the Maize Genetics Co-op Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/) and all project data will be made available from the project web site (http://www.maizeinflorescence.org), and distributed to permanent, public repositories such as MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/). The project integrates highly controlled greenhouse conditions and agriculturally relevant field conditions with genomics resources to understand how environmental and developmental pathways converge. This work will cultivate broad and comprehensive training opportunities across diverse disciplines that encompass plant development, quantitative genetics, abiotic stress responses and bioinformatics. Educational training workshops will be organized to provide experiential learning opportunities both in the US and Mexico, in the lab and in the field. Postdoctoral scholars and graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be mentored in the context of this multi-disciplinary research program."

Investigation of the evolutionary basis of human relationships through study of factors influencing social bonding in chimpanzees, humans' closest living relatives, will reveal how and why social bonds are important. Chimpanzees, like humans, are very unusual among mammals in that males remain in their birth group, while most females join another group at adolescence. Kinship is a powerful basis for friendly bonds, but dispersing females must leave their kin and join groups of unrelated individuals, many of which are hostile to these new competitors.  This project takes advantage of the uniquely long-term field study of the Gombe chimpanzees, initiated by Jane Goodall in 1960, to examine factors influencing whether females disperse, how they integrate into a new community, the kinds of relationships they establish with other females, and how they benefit from these bonds. Results, disseminated in scientific papers, the press, film documentaries, and widely visited websites will keep these iconic chimpanzees in the public eye, and will continue to draw young people (especially women) into science. The project involves undergraduates from underrepresented groups and provides scientific training and education experience to Tanzanians. It provides crucial information for community conservation efforts around Gombe and across Africa.<br/><br/>In the first half of the decadal research plan, the objectives have been to compile and analyze 40 years of spatially-explicit ecological and behavioral data to identify factors influencing female distribution and social association, and to initiate collection of behavioral data on young females in three communities as they settle. In the next 5 years, the first objective is to continue data collection on maturing females to produce a sufficient sample to test the hypothesis that female settlement is based on the location of high quality resources, the density and dominance rank of resident females, and the presence of related or familiar females. The second objective is to collect detailed data on adult female behavior to test hypotheses arising from initial analyses about the nature and consequences of female relationships. Do social bonds enhance the ability to compete for resources and/or dominance via coalitionary aggression? Do bonds with other mothers benefit male offspring by promoting their interactions with male peers? Results will contribute to greater understanding of chimpanzee behavior and provide a basis from which to consider the evolution of mammalian social organization and human relationships.

Where, when and how new genes arise are far-reaching biological questions with practical implications. If scientists could identify emergent genes that confer new traits, the breeding potential for crops could be greatly expanded. During the quest for understanding where new genes come from, it is now known that genes can arise anew from regions of the genome where there were none previously. These so-called ""orphan genes"" may be key ways that species can evolve and adapt to challenging environments through the expression of new traits. To uncover orphan genes, this project taps into the sequenced genomes of maize, a major crop of worldwide importance, and Brassica, another model crop. Both species have major genomic resources available for orphan gene discovery. The research will identify orphan genes and evaluate traits possibly conferred by the genes in maize lines adapted to particular conditions. Candidate orphan genes that influence agronomically important traits will be selected and functionally analyzed. Computational tools will be developed to mine the sequence datasets and the resulting data will be integrated into community databases. At all stages, students will be trained in computational and genomic science. To reach high school students and early undergraduate students, new computer games modules are being developed and tested with the intention of increasing an understanding of the function and potential of orphan genes. A long-term outcome is that researchers and society will be able to design new solutions to improving crops through harnessing orphan genes. <br/><br/>The premise that new genes can arise from non-genic DNA sequences is borne out from massive DNA and RNA sequencing data.  This concept sharply contrasts with the long-accepted view that novel gene functions primarily arise from a slow process of accumulated mutations and rearrangements of already-established genes. A hypothesis is that a major role of orphan genes is to regulate the defense and metabolic responses that enable evolutionary adaptation to new environments.  This research will identify orphan genes of major agronomic species, focusing first on maize and Brassica. These results will inform a systematic analysis of orphan genes at the level of subspecies, thus categorizing orphan genes in the context of the adaptation and selection that has occurred as the result of human intervention for improved agronomic traits. Based on the resultant data, specific orphan genes will be selected for experimental functional analysis. Data will be integrated into community databases, and code will be available to the public. New computer game modules will be targeted to high school and early undergraduate students.  The goal is to develop data and computational tools that facilitate predictive understanding of the function of orphan genes in driving evolutionary adaptation, to harness these resources for improving crops, and to disseminate the information to researchers and students.  These capabilities will empower researchers to explore the significance of recently-emerged orphan genes, and transform fundamental knowledge into innovative solutions that improve crop traits."

In dietary specialists, anatomy may limit these movements to those that are ideal for chewing a narrow range of foods. In contrast, generalists may be capable of more variable movements to deal with broader diets. Given these potential differences in the adaptability of the chewing movements, the role of input from oral sensory receptors may also differ between generalists and specialists. The goal of this study is to determine how oral sensory information and morphology interact to influence the complex jaw and tongue movements that occur during mastication in mammals. Understanding the link between anatomy and diet has been a cornerstone of studies of mammalian biology and evolution but there are no comparative studies on the contribution of oral sensation to chewing movements and coordination within the context of dietary evolution. Results will shed light on potential selective pressures influencing the evolution of sensory and motor systems involved in mastication, a behavior that is implicated in the early evolution and radiation of mammals. In conjunction with the scientific outcomes of this project, PIs will contribute to public school education, public outreach, training of scientists at all levels and the development of research infrastructure. The Williams lab will work with the Ohio University Department of Education, the South East Ohio Center for Excellence in Mathematics and Science, WOUB Public Media and local public school teachers to develop and implement educational modules on evolution, adaptation and functional morphology for middle and high schools. The Gerstner lab will conduct interactive science activities at local schools, and public venues and field institutes in Michigan and Utah.

Data will be made available through public online databases and FDA methods will be disseminated through the web-accessible Comprehensive R Archive Network.<br/><br/>Mastication involves very complex, small and fast movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. In each chewing cycle, jaw movements align the teeth to break down food. The tongue, supported by the hyoid, maintains the food on the teeth. Morphological specializations for diet influence these movements, as do interactions between oral sensory receptors and central and peripheral motor systems. Currently, we do not know whether dietary adaptations influence an animal's range of kinematic responses to changes in sensory stimuli, or how oral sensory systems relate to the adaptive profile of diverse species. Using X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), this project will determine how 1) morphological specialization for diet impacts chewing kinematics and 2) movements are affected in the absence of oral sensory feedback. XROMM allows the continuous measurement of the 3D masticatory movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. Comparisons will be made between 4 dietary generalists and 4 phylogenetically-matched specialists. Data are first analyzed by extracting predetermined kinematic variables from continuous movement profiles. As this approach leaves most of the data unanalyzed, the final aim of this work is to develop and test new analytic tools under the rubric of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and compare results to the previous analyses. FDA is an ideal partner for XROMM because it analyzes the entire movement profile. Results will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings."

The objective of this award is to develop a Genome to Phenome Network (G2PN) Research Collaboration Network (RCN) aimed at promoting comparative analysis of vertebrate and invertebrate animals to enrich our understanding of the relationship between genomes and phenomes. The G2PN will bring together groups using diverse experimental approaches to understand how the genome ultimately manifests the phenome.  The G2PN will provide tools necessary for scientists to exploit comparative genomics approaches to understand genome to phenome relationships. In addition, the activities of the G2PN will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the science of comparative biology and genome to phenome relationships. Participation of researchers from universities and colleges serving historically underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged.  The G2PN will also generate educational modules to further enhance student training in G2P concepts. All of the resources developed by the G2PN will be freely available to the scientific community, communicated at scientific meetings, and published in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>A major objective of the G2PN will be to encourage researchers to leave their silos and develop collaborative teams that will exploit comparative approaches to enhance our understanding of genome to phenome relationships. The G2PN RCN goals include: Establishing an international G2PN with scientists studying a diverse range of animals; G2PN activities that will directly foster the development of comparative studies by promoting standardization of experimental approaches, data and metadata collection and bioinformatic analyses; promoting new collaborations and proposals among scientists from different specialties through international meetings, web sites, publications and social media; and promoting understanding of comparative genomic studies through the development of training modules using diverse educational modalities. Ultimately, this RCN will improve our understanding of the relationships between selective pressures, genomic changes and phenotypic outcomes.  The standards developed by this RCN will find applicability far beyond the science directly affected by the G2P network. These standards will facilitate laboratory work and data comparability across a broad range of species and studies."

It is expected that chromatin mapping will reveal previously undetected and biochemically functional regions of the maize genome, while integrating genetic information from maize and other plant genome research projects. Together these efforts will provide basic information about chromatin structure that could accelerate crop improvement strategies to address current and future challenges in food and biofuel production.  With regard to outreach and training, the project will provide research training for postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from underrepresented groups.

Measuring the differential nuclease sensitivity (DNS-seq) across the entire maize genome will uncover localized sites coupled to evolutionarily conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, and gene expression levels.

Even closely related plants display different types of fleshy fruits that accomplish dispersal through variation in color, shape, size, texture and other traits. A major question for plant biologists and fruit crop scientists is how these diverse fruit types evolved and what factors control their development. If scientists could explain the molecular basis of different fruit types, new breeding tools could be used to increase the value of fruit crops and basic research could be advanced. The Rose family (Rosaceae) is an excellent example of how fruits have been selected and adapted to different types of dispersal. Members of the family, including the familiar strawberries, apples, and roses, all have unique fruits and floral structures from which the fruits are derived. This project investigates how these different fruits develop at the molecular level. Using comparative genomic and bioinformatics methods, the research will identify shared and unique genes that control the pattern of fruit development among five representatives of the Rose family: strawberries, peach, plum, apple and raspberry. Computational methods will be used to identify regulatory gene networks that explain how and when the diverse fruits form. High school teachers will be brought into the research program during the summer to study fruit science and computational data analysis, and curricula will be developed for use in the high school classroom. By integrating teachers into the research, the next generation of students will be impacted broadly and will gain hands-on exposure to genomics and bioinformatics. <br/><br/>The project investigates the molecular genetic mechanisms that underlie the phenotypic diversity of fleshy fruits in the Rosaceae. By leveraging the evolutionary conservation of genes within the Rosaceae genome, the power of comparative genomics will be used to identify key genes and mechanisms of fleshy fruit development. The recently published Rosaceae genome sequences (apple, strawberry, peach, raspberry and plum) provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this fundamental biological question. First, detail morphological and histological changes during floral and early stage fruit development will be characterized for the chosen Rosaceae species. This knowledge will guide sample collection for RNA-sequencing methods immediately before and after fertilization in specific floral tissues. Innovative bioinformatic tools and strategies will be developed to identify toolkit genes and regulatory gene networks, whose spatial or temporal shifts of expression may alter fleshy fruit programs in different species. Functional tests including RNAi, CRISPR, and tissue-specific ectopic expression will be carried out to test predicted toolkit genes using the established transformation systems in strawberry, FasTrack plum, and apple. The ultimate goal is to identify causal relationships between changes of toolkit gene expression and evolution of distinct fleshy fruit types. The research activities will be integrated with several educational and outreach programs including training of students and postdoctoral researchers in genomics and informatics, bioinformatics workshops for high school teachers from rural West Virginia and predominantly minority-serving schools of Prince Georges County of Maryland, and outreach to the public about Genetically Modified Organisms and fruit genomics. All sequence data will be made available through the public NCBI database and through the community database for the Rosaceae."

Decades of experimental research in animal taxa and epidemiological studies of humans have demonstrated that nutrition in the womb and behavioral care after birth are instrumental for the developing young. Mother's milk sustains infant growth, development, and behavioral activity, but little is known about the effects of milk on offspring brain and behavior, especially after weaning during adolescence and adulthood. Importantly, mother's milk is food, medicine, and hormonal signal. This project will investigate how mother's milk ingested in infancy influences neurobiology and social behavior in adolescence and adulthood by programming behavior during early life. Longitudinal, interdisciplinary research on how mother's milk shapes offspring, not only addresses key theoretical questions in animal behavior, but has important implications for infant nutrition, clinical recommendations, and human well-being. Such knowledge will inform maternal decisions about breast-feeding initiation and duration, improve replacement and supplemental formula compositions, influence clinical interventions during early life, and can shape institutional policy (e.g. parental leave). Researchers in the Comparative Lactation Lab create research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees, particularly through minority tracks of the PRISE (Program for Research in Science & Engineering) and HGWISE (Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering). The results will be communicated to the general public through ""Mammals Suck... Milk!"" a blog written accessibly for clinical and lay audiences, as well as science outreach lectures in K-12 classrooms, natural history museums, and science centers. <br/><br/>The study will address two key questions in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta): 1) How does early life nutrition and hormonal signaling via mother's milk affect social behavior, particularly social networks, mating, and maternal behavior during transitions from adolescence to adulthood and 2) How are these behavioral effects mediated through the organization of temperament and neurobiology during infancy. Neurobiological (PET and MRI) and behavioral investigations of lactocrine programming, both nutritional and hormonal, are needed in long-lived, socially-complex, singleton-rearing taxa. This project provides an unparalleled and ephemeral opportunity to prospectively assess neurobiological and behavioral outcomes in a targeted cohort of adolescent and adult rhesus monkeys that were intensively studied as infants, including systematic analysis of the milk their mothers produced. Longitudinal integration of early life experiences with neurobiology, behavioral phenotype, and fitness outcomes addresses fundamental aspects of maternal effects and developmental programming and advances an understanding of how selection has shaped maternal investment strategies and consequences for offspring. Results generated from the proposed research will be disseminated to the scholarly and clinical community via open access publication and data will be made searchable, available, and citable through the online Dryad Data Repository."

Understanding evolution is essential for figuring out solutions to modern problems such as antibiotic resistance, a major problem in medicine, and for understanding how life on our planet became so diverse and how it will change next. Animal weapons including such intriguing structures as horns on bighorn sheep, antlers on deer, and tusks on elephants, have fascinated people for centuries. The earliest-known human paintings show wild animals fighting with weapons. In spite of the interest these structures have attracted, understanding of weapon diversity is in its infancy. This project will increase understanding of why even closely-related species can have profoundly different weapons. Simultaneously, it will provide important insights into why other shapes and forms in nature can be so variable. Data and specimens collected as part of this project will be stored in scientific archives and museums, where they will be shared freely with other researchers for use in future projects. This project will also contribute directly to the science education of more than two hundred college students. These students will learn how to do science and to recognize that science is a process, not just a collection of facts. The researchers will also interact and share their results with the general public through blogs, presentations, and student-made videos about experiences doing science.<br/><br/>The diverse traits resulting from sexual selection offer outstanding opportunities for understanding the evolutionary interactions between behavior and morphology. It is now well established that mate choice and male-male competition can select for differences in the sizes of ornaments and weapons. However the evolution of the shape of these traits is more puzzling. Why has such shape diversity evolved? In the case of animal weapons, habitat-driven changes in male-male competitive behavior are hypothesized to be a central factor. However, explicit tests of this hypothesis are virtually nonexistent. This project will examine the roles of fighting behavior, ecology, and function in the evolution of weapon shape, capitalizing on the extreme weapon shape diversity and myriad of fighting styles in leaf-footed bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae) to address the long-standing puzzle of weapon shape diversity. Methods include experimental selection analyses, finite element analysis, phylogenetics, and ancestral state reconstructions. The successful completion of this project will offer an unprecedented analysis of the evolutionary interplay between behavior and morphology, using the medium of weaponry. Data and specimens will be stored and shared with other scientists through international archives, including NCBI, DRYAD, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Over 200 undergraduates will contribute to the completion of this project through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE), and curricular materials developed for this purpose will be shared with other educators through workshops and publications. Training in the integration of research and education will also be provided to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. Substantial outreach will be accomplished through the production of short videos by students, blogs, research spotlights, social media, and public presentations."

It is not fully understood how the diversity in root architecture contributes to crop yields or plant biomass in part because roots are buried underground and difficult to study. This research takes a quantitative approach to analyze the wide diversity of root architectures. Bean roots grown under experimental conditions will be imaged and the resulting data will be used to create new mathematical and computational tools to discern causes of root variability. Combined with genomic information, the analytical tools will identify genetic elements underlying root shapes in response to environmental and genetic variation. The research will point to new opportunities for breeding targets in crops such as bean and extended to maize. The research also couples with an education program that integrates computation with plant research, thus addressing the critical national need for a computationally trained plant science workforce. The novel tools will be publicly available and deployed using national cyberinfrastructure: further the technologies will be integrated into two courses that enable basic science and computational biology within an experiential learning environment. A new student award is implemented through the Plant Center and the Georgia Informatics Institute to highlight advances attained by working at the computational and plant science interface. Together, the integration of science and education sets forth a path for fast dissemination of results into breeding programs. <br/><br/>After decades of research on plant roots it is still a mystery how and why root architecture arises in seemingly endless variations of shapes. The research introduces the phenotypic spectrum as a new quantitative theory that extends the established concept of plasticity by a new dimension. The phenotypic spectrum of one genotype consists of distinct root architecture types, each of which is hypothesized to be associated with a different plasticity curve across environments. Theoretically, the phenotypic spectrum emerges for a population of one genotype if all elementary geometric measurements at all locations within each individual root system are taken and each individual is summarized by a whole root descriptor. Descriptors with similar characteristics correspond to one architecture type. Hence, the spectrum is not observable with current phenotyping tools that capture only one location in a root system per trait. Quantifying the phenotypic spectrum demands the development of unprecedented whole root descriptors and simulation techniques to capture the differences in the 3D spatial organization of the whole root architecture. In doing so, a new combination of differential geometry and imaging approaches as well as a newly developed statistical analysis is proposed. The experiments will provide an understanding of how to describe and evaluate the interplay of different root architecture types in the greenhouse and the field by linking both with the developed descriptors. The educational goal is to increase the number of researchers at the interface of computational and plant sciences through two courses using the developed tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most often, the mRNA transcript is used as a template for translation into protein molecules.  The transcription process produces a pre-messenger RNA, which is extensively processed to yield a mature mRNA ready for translation.  Because the structure of most genes in animals and plants is one where the DNA sequence information used to specify protein (exons) is interspersed with stretches of DNA sequences that are non-coding (introns), one of the modifications that pre-mRNA undergo is the splicing out of intron sequence and the joining of the exon sequences. In many cases, this splicing process can be directed to purposefully skip exons, retain introns, and change the exon boundaries. This process, called Alternative Splicing (AS), enables the production of distinctly different messages from a single gene, and this can increase the number of different proteins a gene is able to produce. The extent and roles of AS in plants is not well understood; however, a thorough understanding of AS, especially within crop plants that produce food, industrial and fuel products, is necessary to enable prediction of phenotype from genotype and utilize crop genetic resources to their full potential. The outcomes of this project will be the genome-wide identification and public release of AS isoforms within 42 plant species.  Analysis of these data during this project will provide a better understanding of the evolutionary history of AS in plants and provide access to some of the genetic features involved in regulating AS. With regard to outreach and training, this project will develop a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that provides hands-on training for undergraduate life science majors in modern genomics, lab techniques, high performance computing and ""big data"" OMICS analysis, skill sets that have become increasingly important in research and medicine.<br/><br/>An understanding of the extent of AS in plants and the biological processes that AS transcript isoforms impact are not well established. However, it is proposed that alternatively spliced transcripts may play significant roles during growth, development and stress response, and failure to identify these and understand their significance hampers the understanding of gene to phenotype, and slows crop improvement efforts. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the function, regulation and evolution of alternative splicing (AS) in plants.  Specifically, the project will address the following questions: 1) What genes produce alternatively spliced transcripts and what processes do they affect? 2) How is AS in plants regulated? 3) What are the evolutionary histories of AS isoforms in plants? To address these questions, this project will identify and characterize AS events broadly from available public data and investigate their ancestral states in plants. Specifically, AS isoforms will be identified across and within 46 genomes representing 42 plant species broadly distributed across the kingdom. Once identified, AS isoforms will be characterized with regard to their conservation and evolutionary history. Finally, evolutionary conserved AS events will be selected to investigate sequence and epigenetic features associated with AS that may play a regulatory role. All data and resources generated in this project will be made available to the public through the project website, as well as long-term through the NCBI's SRA and CyVerse."

Different groups of arthropods used different methods to enable breathing air, a critical requirement for life on land, a change that occurred separately in at least 7 groups.  The goal of this project is to investigate how an air-breathing respiratory system evolved separately in multiple arthropod groups.  Did evolution of aerial respiration involve alteration to the same anatomical structures and genes in each group, or does each arthropod group use a different solution to the problem of breathing air?  To resolve this question, the embryonic formation of respiratory organs in eight arthropod species will be investigated.  Genes and proteins will be tested to determine whether the same genes are used in the respiratory system of all arthropods.  Genome sequencing will further test and identify genes that create unique respiratory structures (e.g., the book lung of spiders).  The outcomes of this research will be integrated into a new laboratory-based course on invertebrate zoology, to be taught annually through the Department of Zoology, using live specimens.  A museum exhibit will be developed on the movement of arthropods onto land, and using evidence from fossils, genes, and developmental biology.  One postdoctoral fellow, one graduate student, and ten summer undergraduates will be trained during the work, emphasizing recruitment of women and underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Investigating the parallel evolution of aerial respiration in Arthropoda has previously been limited to studies of functional morphology or expression data from a few taxa. Some developmental data suggest that mandibulate and chelicerate respiratory systems are directly homologous, whereas a separate set of data suggests that respiratory organs of arachnids arose independently from modified walking legs. Respiratory systems of Myriapoda have not been studied in a developmental genetic context at all. To resolve the origins of internalized respiratory systems of arthropods, the proposed work will examine positional, genetic, and serial homology of respiratory organs in eight emerging model arthropod systems. To establish the serial homology of arachnid respiratory organs, Hox misexpression experiments will be conducted to derepress appendages in posterior segments. To establish degree of conservation of the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying tubulogenesis across Arthropoda, gene expression assays will be performed for candidate genes known to be required for establishment of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal tubule system. To assess functional correspondence, knockdown experiments will be conducted in two chelicerate and three mandibulate exemplars for five critical genes in the Drosphila GRN. To investigate the patterning of the arachnid book lung, comparative transcriptomic data will be generated from book lung primordia of spiders and scorpions, toward identifying a set of novel candidate genes putatively involved in book lung morphogenesis for further functional screening. This work will directly address the two competing scenarios of arthropod terrestrialization that persist in the literature, using independent tests of positional, serial, and genetic homology."

The MaizeCODE project aims to create a comprehensive reference encyclopedia of highly useful genomic reference sequence resources for breeders and plant scientists to use to improve economically important crop traits like disease resistance and yield. In addition, this project will provide broad and comprehensive training opportunities for students, breeders and practicing scientists through specific courses and workshops that will address various approaches to obtain and analyze MaizeCODE data. The Education, Outreach, and Training (EOT) effort will prepare faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to analyze MaizeCODE with undergraduate students and will provide travel awards for graduate students to attend MaizeCODE training at professional meetings. The EOT program will be unique in promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines by anticipating and encouraging broad participation in primary data analysis by undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Improved assemblies of the maize genome will provide a foundation for the identification of biochemically active and biologically functional elements encoded in this working-draft sequence.  A comprehensive catalog of these elements will be a critical component in strategies to link genotype with important traits in maize, a classical genetic system. This is the overarching goal of the MaizeCODE project. The human ENCODE project is a model for such a comprehensive catalog. Building on the project team's leadership experience with ENCODE,  this similarly integrated and multi-disciplinary project has three main objectives: 1) to develop high-quality working drafts for two inbred maze lines and one teosinte inbred line, 2) to identify regions of the maize genome that are transcribed, methylated, bound by specific modified histones in six cell types that are the major progenitors of the root and shoot systems (focusing on histone modification in three root cell types) and transcription factors in five unrelated tissues and 3) to store, collate, display and disseminate the data to the broader community of plant biologists worldwide. Given the wealth of ""genome to phenome"" studies in maize, and the emerging realization that much of the variation under selection acts at the level of gene regulation, it is expected that this project will have broad and significant impact on maize genetics research and breeding, with the potential to inform similar research in other grass crops. The project expects to extend significantly the functional annotations and the current understanding of the regulation of gene activity in maize, adding critical content to established databases and graphical genome display centers.

This award supports fundamental research to combine the strengths of machine learning and crop models. Machine learning algorithms will be used to predict intermediate plant traits, which will then be fed into a crop model to predict grain yields across different environment and field management practices. Both conception and execution of this EAGER project depend on collaborations across multiple disciplines, including high-throughput phenotyping, object recognition, machine learning, optimization, computer simulation, and crop modeling. If successful, this research is expected to improve not only accuracy but also interpretability of yield prediction models, which will open numerous opportunities for downstream research and discoveries. The interdisciplinary effort will enhance the impact of science and engineering education across disciplines, while providing a collaborative and inclusive environment for all students to engage in cutting edge research activities.<br/><br/>Underlying yield prediction is one of the grand challenges of biology: understanding how phenotype is determined by genotype, environment, and their interactions. Machine learning algorithms are able to predict crop phenotype to reasonable accuracy based on genotype information, but most models have a black box structure and their results are hard to interpret. On the other hand, crop models offer biological insights into causes of phenotypic variation by providing explicit explanations of the interactions between traits and environmental conditions in different phases of the crop growth cycle, but the collection of trait measurement data and calibration of model coefficients are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. The proposed approach is a nested model. Deep learning algorithms will be trained to predict leaf appearance rate from genotype and empirically measured trait data. Training data will be extracted from images of plant leaves obtained via field experiments that employ novel phenotyping technique. Next, the resulting predicted traits and environment data will be fed into the crop model to predict yield.

Given the difficulties of studying aging in humans, the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, will be used as a model to link the activity of specific genes known to affect aging. A mathematical model of the relationship between environment, genes, and longevity will be generated to reveal which genes and environments are most important in determining aging and longevity and to enable the prediction of lifespan. This information will be used in future work that focuses on whether these predictions can be extended to other organisms, and ultimately to humans.

Mathematical and statistical models that can predict lifespan of an individual based on lifelong activity of key aging pathways will be developed. The research tests whether variability in activity of key genes (due to biological noise or environmental or genetic perturbations) is propagated to variability in lifespan. To address this question, a microfluidic platform that enables monitoring of multiple individuals throughout their lifespan, while quantifying the activity of key aging pathways through endogenous fluorescent reporters, will be developed. The proposed platform will allow data pairing, where gene activity at the single individual level can be paired with its lifespan. Experimental tools that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of in vivo gene activity and combinatorial environmental perturbations will be developed. These tools hinge on microfluidics, computer vision, automation, and new reporter strains engineered by CRISPR to track gene activity under endogenous regulatory control. The acquired data sets will be used to derive data-driven mathematical models that describe the stochastic dynamics of gene activity and its downstream phenotypic outcome: lifespan. Novel statistical techniques will be combined with mathematical models to infer phenotypic heterogeneity and robustness within populations.

This leads to delays and increase in costs of development of new varieties that are more productive, disease resistant and tolerant to environmental stresses.  In the case of forestry, this wait can be decades-long, thus hampering tree improvement for the timber, paper and bioenergy industries.  Development of new cultivars could be accelerated if there was a way to tell what useful traits a plant would have based on its DNA alone.  The ability to use DNA to predict the traits of a grown plant, from its development to its productivity, remains one of the recognized grand challenges of plant biology. Even more relevant and incomplete is the understanding of the chain of events that lead from DNA to trait. A complete understanding of a plant's biological system will allow the identification of the key regulatory points that impact its traits of economic importance, while also allowing their prediction. In this project novel approaches will be developed to predict the development and the growth properties of plants, and their immediate regulators. These approaches will integrate information beyond DNA to include gene expression data, and create a more complete description and prediction of trait regulation. Tools developed here will be disseminated to the community by the release of analysis software packages, and workshops will be conducted to enhance teaching of quantitative genetics and statistical methods in predictive models to the scientific community. The project incorporates a training component focused on high-school teachers and students. High-school teachers will join the investigator laboratories to learn about real-world applications of genomics and develop curriculum with support of the University of Florida Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET). Students from underrepresented groups will be trained in science through CPET's Student Science Training Program. The proposed research will also provide ample opportunities to train graduate students at the intersection between quantitative and statistical genetics, and genomics. <br/><br/>Genomic prediction of complex traits is a critical tool in animal and plant breeding. However, the ability to fully explain a phenotypic trait is still limited, in part because several dimensions of information are either not available or not incorporated to prediction models. In this project, genome sequence information will be used initially to predict gene expression, and gene expression of the ensemble of genes will be applied to predict whole-plant phenotypes. As a last step, genome sequence and transcriptome data will be integrated for prediction of phenotypes and their regulators. Thus, a model for prediction that incorporates multiple layers of information will serve as a tool for prediction of plant molecular properties (e.g. gene expression), as well as growth and developmental traits. This project will make use of a large Populus deltoides association population for which abundant genome, transcriptome and phenotypic resources are already available or will be developed here. Prediction tools will also be applicable to other species for which similar type of resources are available. The research methods to be applied to each aim will consist of four components: (1) detection of large-effect factors (e.g., individual or groups of variants with large regulatory effects) using single-factor regression methods, (2) development of prediction models that combine whole-genome information from large and small-effect factors, (3) biological validation of findings using genetic modification, and (4) statistical validation using an independent population. Genotypic and gene expression data will be publically available in NCBI's dbSNP and the sequence read archive/gene expression omnibus databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Analysis packages will be deposited in the R Archive (http://cran.r-project.org/), and project details and plant resource access procedures will be described in the project web site (http://sfrc.ufl.edu/forestgenomics/Kirstlab/)."

Plants are able to adapt to challenging conditions by adjusting how they grow and how much nutrients they take in from the environment. Understanding these adjustments of plants in response to environmental challenge is important for a basic understanding of how plants may respond in rapidly changing environments, and will yield insights about ways to increase agricultural production to support a fast growing human population. Basic research suggests that plants, like animals, use a small set of signaling chemicals, hormones, to sense the environment, and to control their metabolism and growth. Since hormones play such a key role in regulating plant development and responses to the environment, it is important to identify the main 'genetic hubs', where environmental signals and hormonal changes are integrated in order to control a plant's life. This basic scientific knowledge will improve our understanding of how plants grow and react to stress and will help in the development of new crop varieties that perform well under extreme conditions. Traditionally scientists have studied how hormones influence gene activity by examining gene expression by measuring the copying of DNA into RNA, the first step in the transfer of genetic information into proteins, which play an enormous variety of functional roles in cells. However, an increase in expression does not always mean that more protein will be made because protein production from encoded RNA molecules is a highly regulated process. Fortunately, the recently developed Ribo-seq technology provides the capability of measuring protein production by every active gene in the genome at once. By using this technology, 'genetic hubs' that connect environmental sensing with the control of plant growth can be uncovered. Understanding how these hubs work at the molecular level will add new tools to the ""biotechnological toolbox"" that scientists can then use to develop better and more resilient crops.<br/><br/>Genome-wide changes in translation activity in response to ethylene have been quantified at codon resolution by taking advantage of the recently developed ribosome footprinting technology, making it possible to identify new translational regulatory elements in Arabidopsis. Importantly, detailed characterization of one of the novel regulatory elements indicates that regulation of translation is not miRNA dependent, and that the element identified is also responsive to the plant hormone auxin, implicating this element in the interaction between ethylene and auxin. These findings not only confirm the basic biological importance of translational regulation and its potential as a signal integration mechanism, but also open new avenues for identifying, characterizing and utilizing additional regulatory modules of gene expression in plant species of economic importance. Towards that goal, a plant-optimized ribosome footprinting methodology will be deployed to examine the translation landscape of two plant species, tomato and Arabidopsis, in response to two plant hormones, ethylene and auxin. A time-course experiment will be performed to maximize the detection sensitivity and diversity (early vs. late activation) of translational regulatory elements. The resulting data, reflecting temporal changes, will be used to generate hierarchical transcriptional and translational interaction network models for the two hormones, and to identify key regulatory nodes.  Finally, the comparison between two plant species will provide critical information about conservation of the regulatory elements, thereby  informing research on future practical applications.  All the sequence data will be made publicly available through the NCBI-SRA.  All biological materials and genomic data will be available through a dedicated project website at brcwebportal.cos.ncsu.edu/plantriboprints).  In addition, software and contents of the genome browser will be deposited at iPlant to ensure long-term public access.  Arabidopsis seeds and DNA constructs will be deposited at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.  A new outreach program to promote interest among middle- and high-school kids in combining biology, computers, and engineering will be developed. A web-based bilingual dissemination tool, Plants4Teens, as well as live monthly demos at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and local schools, will be implemented in this new outreach program. Examples of demonstration modules will include comparisons between simple electronic and genetic circuits."

More specifically, gametophytes are central to plant reproduction; thus this project is directly relevant to several agricultural objectives (e.g., controlling pollen fertility, limiting pollen-mediated transgene flow, inducing apomixis), particularly given the project's focus on a crucial crop plant, maize. Additionally, the project will provide a data framework for other researchers to determine how gametophytes function and how they can be manipulated to generate improved crop plants. This project will train a number of undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scientists in an interdisciplinary fashion through frequent exchanges between the partnering laboratories. Undergraduates will gain experience in modern laboratory techniques as well as computational analysis of large-scale data sets. Undergraduate students will simultaneously be trained as researchers and educators through Stanford University's Science in Service Program. Undergraduates learn to be Science Mentors for high school students and develop laboratory curricula that are then performed by local high school programs under the supervision of the undergraduate mentors. As part of the project, students from the high school programs also participate in the project, getting exposure to genetics and image analysis. <br/><br/>Within the floral tissues of flowering plants, multicellular haploid female and male gametophytes produce the gametes that undergo fertilization to produce seeds. Although gametophytes are small and undergo few cell divisions, they are crucial for producing the next generation, and execute diverse biological processes. Plant seed formation and reproduction, and thus global agriculture, are dependent on gametophyte function. In spite of their critical role in plant reproduction, gametophyte function and development has largely been overlooked due to their small size and imbedded location within the parental tissue. The maize genome, like many crop plant genomes, harbors a large number of mobile DNA elements, called transposons, and control of these elements, often through regulation of epigenetic states, is critical for maintenance of gene function and genome structure. Gametophytes help set epigenetic states in the next generation, however little is known, especially in the female gametophyte, about how transposon expression is regulated, and how that control impacts the concurrent expression of protein-coding genes. This project will use tissue micro-dissection techniques and whole genome analysis to understand the mechanisms that underlie developmental regulation of epigenetic states and cellular functions in the gametophytes of both sexes in maize. This project will screen for new mutants and genes that function in gametophyte development; perform genome-wide analysis of expression of genes, transposons, and different classes of RNAs with cellular detail; generate visual reporters for transposon activity; and characterize transposon expression in developing gametophytes. This project will determine the spatial and temporal expression pattern for genes and transposons in developing gametophytes, as well as define how they function to program gametophyte development. The effect of relevant mutants on transposon expression is expected to increase understanding of the interaction between basic gametophyte development and control of transposon activity in the important crop plant, maize. The sequence gene expression data generated from this project will be widely accessible through the project website (www.maizegametophyte.org) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), and the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (maizegdb.org).

This project will take a comprehensive approach to define the epigenome of bread wheat, the functional consequences of epigenetic modifications, how the genome is re-shaped, stabilized and inherited in newly formed hybrids, and how the environment may influence patterns of epigenetic modification. These are fundamentally important questions in biology and are necessary for understanding trait variation in wheat hybrids.  It is anticipated that this project will have broad impacts across three specific themes. The first of these relates to food security. Food security is an ever-increasing challenge in the face of factors such as urbanization and world population growth. One factor that significantly affects agricultural yields of bread wheat is the epigenetic regulation of high-yielding hybrid lines. A better understanding of this process will help others understand the basic processes involved in the creation and stabilization of hybrid lines and thus improve the efficiency at which they can be derived and contribute to food security. The second broad area where the work will have significant impacts is in the area of climate change. Understanding how changing climate affects epigenetic regulation of an important crop genome will likely have broad implications for the understanding of how agricultural yields will be challenged and can be modified to respond to changing climate. Lastly the project will have broad impact in the area of enhancing scientific education and understanding. Rapidly advancing science and technology presents a challenge in conveying a general understanding of that technology and the science behind it to the general public. This project will be used as a platform to better explain science to the general public using different and new educational tools. In addition to the training of students, the project will provide summer international exchange research training for graduate students associated with the US-EU consortium.<br/><br/>Wheat is a polyploid arising from recent hybridization of goat grass (Aegilops tauschii, DD) with wild tetraploid emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides, AABB) to form hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum AABBDD). This process of hybridization is critical to achieving the high yields produced by modern wheat varieties. However, much is not understood about this process particularly in terms of how epigenetics regulates which parental line is expressed within the agriculturally significant hybrids. This project will generate information about the epigenetic regulation of the bread wheat genome and its role in the stabilization of the component genomes within the hybrids. One aim is to understand how epigenetic variation alters gene expression in hybrid wheat by identifying how epigenetic traits or epigenetic marks are set during hybridization in the formation of new wheat strains and how these are maintained in stable wheat hybrids to allow for high agricultural yields. It is the expectation that this project will provide a much better understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to epigenetics that are involved in the creation and stabilization of high-yielding hybrid wheat strains. All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, all datasets will be accessible through the iPlant Collaborative and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) as well as through publicly available data repositories including GenBank."

As a result, individuals with different final adult body sizes typically differ in the proportions of sizes of their body parts. This phenomenon is called allometry. Although allometry has been extensively described and studied for more than a century, those studies have been largely descriptive and have made simple and unrealistic assumptions about how different body parts grow. This is in part because the physiological processes responsible for producing allometries are still poorly understood and because the theoretical tools used to analyze and interpret allometries cannot deduce growth processes correctly.  As a result, the mechanisms that control size, shape and the relative sizes of body parts remain among the great unsolved puzzles in Biology. The proposed work will develop new practical and theoretical tools for the analysis of how, and why, the relative sizes of body parts vary. Understanding how organs grow to their correct size and shape has profound implications for understanding the causes and mechanisms of normal development and of developmental abnormalities.  User-friendly software will be developed and freely distributed that will allow students and researchers to implement the equations developed in this research and analyze allometries in novel and more productive ways. This project will provide interdisciplinary training in biological mathematics and physiology for a graduate student and a diverse group of undergraduates. Outreach to local schools and regional science museums, with talks and hands-on exercises on insect biology, laboratory visits by junior-high school students from underserved schools, and continuing participation and mentorship with the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science on the biology of insects are integral parts of the Principal Investigator's commitment to disseminating science and making the resources provided by NSF more broadly available to the local community.<br/><br/>The proposed research has three principal aims: (1) to develop an improved theory and new equations for static allometry, (2) to test and validate the theory against rich and diverse data sets from insects and mammals, and (3) to investigate the physiological factors that give rise to allometric relationships. The experimental work will focus on wing-body allometry in Lepidoptera, where the control of growth and size is best understood. Growth and size are controlled by developmental hormones and by the timing and duration of hormone secretion. This work will use several genetic strains of Manduca sexta that differ in body size and that can be reared under different environmental conditions of temperature and nutrition, which also affect size and allometry. This will produce a rich data set that will permit a functional interpretation of the effects of genes and environment on growth patterns and on the resulting allometries. The results of this work will allow researchers to analyze the causes of complex non-linear allometries, and deduce the underlying growth patterns that give rise to those allometries. This work will also provide new insights into the physiological mechanisms by which variation in genetic background and environment alters size, shape and allometry."

This project involves establishing a research coordination network, to bring together scientists from mathematical modeling and biological fields to develop multilevel mechanistic models that integrate existing and new data to predict responses by vertebrates to environmental change-related stressors. Specific goals include the creation of an initial core network of participants with expertise either at different levels of biological complexity and/or at creating and using mathematical models, expansion of the original network with special emphasis in recruiting young scientists, hosting workshops to foster education and formation of new interdisciplinary collaborations, training through exchanges between labs, and development and dissemination of webinars derived from the workshops. Scientific, regional, gender and ethnic diversity of the participants will broaden participation and expose participants to diverse social and scientific cultures. Of the initial participants, eight nations are represented, about half are early career, over half are female, and many are members of under-represented groups in science. Through the synthesis of empirical science and modeling, new knowledge can be generated and used to inform key stakeholders including policymakers, land managers, and the general public. The project will recruit secondary school teachers for training and development of curricular modules for incorporation into high school science programs through teacher outreach, develop webinars for public education resources, and create webinars for use by researchers.<br/><br/>This research coordination network will address a grand challenge in biology, 'Deciphering the Genomes-to-Phenomes (G2P) Relationship' with extension to the population level. This understanding is essential for predicting animal resilience and vulnerability to rapid environmental change.  Participant expertise will span from genomes to populations and will include quantitative modelers at all levels of biological organization. Primary activities include annual workshops to foster discussion and interaction among mathematical modelers and organismal scientists.  Each workshop will include interactive lectures by experts within a topic area, followed by discussion of modeling approaches, and limitations and opportunities within and across levels of biological organization. Next will be communication of new techniques and approaches to generation of biological data and modeling, followed by planning sessions for new collaborations and funding opportunities.  Webinars will be organized to train participants in mechanistic modeling of biological systems across levels.  Collaborations in research and generation of manuscripts and proposals will be facilitated through investment in cross-disciplinary exchanges of network participants.

The cuticle is a waxy, water-proof layer on the outer surfaces of plant leaves and stems that plays a vital role in preventing water loss. It is also where plants first interact with most insects and diseases.  Therefore, the cuticle is important to keep plants healthy while preventing them from drying out in the breeze.  While many prior projects have contributed insights into cuticle composition, development and function, very few have focused on the adult leaves of cereal crops, whose cuticle has a significant impact on the agricultural performance of these key crops. This project will discover genes that control cuticle development and function in corn, evaluate the potential for improvement of the leaf cuticle to help produce crops with increased drought tolerance and resistance to diseases, and generate tools to guide these efforts.<br/><br/>Prior studies have laid a foundation for understanding cuticle biogenesis and function in plants, but very few have focused on adult leaves of economically important cereal crops such as maize, and none have yet been translated to crop improvements. This project will analyze the biogenesis of adult maize leaf cuticle and its genetic basis, and will elucidate the impact of genetically determined cuticle variation on drought tolerance and pathogen penetration. The first aim is to relate genome-wide analysis of epidermal gene expression to changes in cuticle structure, composition, and function across a developmental timecourse. The second aim is to identify loci controlling cuticular evaporation (CE) rate in adult leaves via a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The third aim is to analyze maize lines selected for diversity in cuticle function to elucidate relationships between cuticle characteristics (histology, ultrastructure and composition), cuticle function as a barrier against water loss and pathogen penetration, and drought tolerance. The fourth aim is to elucidate, via network analysis, the relationships between gene expression, cuticle composition, and cuticle function. This final aim is expected to identify key genetic regulators and a systems-level understanding of the genetic basis for cuticle biogenesis and function in adult maize leaves. Project outcomes will include new insights regarding adult maize leaf cuticle development and its genetic regulation, new knowledge of the impact of cuticle modification on drought tolerance and pathogen infection in maize, and genetic tools to guide such modifications. Project outcomes and data will be communicated through multiple open access publications, a project website housed at http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/smith/, and deposition of data to three long-term repositories: the NCBI Short Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), Maize GDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/), and an interactive database to be hosted by the UCSD library (http://library.ucsd.edu/dc). Participation in this project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities preparing young scientists at various stages of their education to enter the science workforce of the future. It will also broaden participation in science by involving approximately 120 undergraduates at all institutions combined, with a focus on students with minimal prior access to research opportunities and/or awareness of science career opportunities."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Douglas Allen.<br/><br/>As the world population increases, crop breeding efforts will need to increase yields while minimizing detrimental impacts on the environment. In particular, understanding how plants acquire and use nitrogen can help determine proper fertilizer use. Plant nitrogen demands vary in different parts of the plant based on whether the tissue is photosynthetic and acting as a source of carbon, as in leaves, or is a sink for carbon and nitrogen as in seeds. Plants with optimized source-sink relationships could break the inverse correlation between yield and protein content that is well-documented over the last 50 years. Training objectives for the Fellow include synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and metabolic flux analysis. Broader impacts include promoting plant science through outreach programs with the St. Louis Girl Scouts, ASPB Planting Science, and Future Trek STEM Careers.<br/><br/>This project will use a genetic approach in maize, sorghum, and the C4 model species Setaria viridis to investigate the interrelationship between asparagine cycling in nitrogen metabolism and the C4 photosynthetic pathway in leaves and seeds of cereals in order to modulate source and sink relationships.

This work will investigate how nature innovates, by using insects as model organisms, and by assessing the significance of two proposed, alternative routes to novelty. The first route posits that much innovation is made possible through the re-use- and re-combination of already existing biological features, from genes to tissue types to organs, not unlike how the pre-existing building blocks of Lego creations can be reassembled and recombined to generate novel structures. The second route in turn emphasizes how novel traits may originate from scratch, piece by piece over time. Ultimately, the work will contrast the mechanisms, efficiency, and consequences of innovation via these two routes, and how they may help us understand why and how life on earth has innovated and diversified the way it has. This work will also be leveraged to further expand an existing, highly successful collaboration with a children's museum to train science teachers in support of Indiana Science Teaching Standards, and to develop teaching resources for special education and ESL students. Similarly, this work will be used to enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in science through the research team's participation in three award winning summer programs and the recruitment of minority High School students into the group for individualized summer research immersion. Lastly, this work will train at least six scientists in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>How novel, complex traits originate, how they integrate into preexisting contexts without disruption, and the developmental properties that facilitate their subsequent diversification, all remain overall poorly understood. This work utilizes horned beetles, and the disparate routes of innovation exemplified by different types of horns, to address these challenges. The first major objective focuses on prothoracic horns, which preliminary evidence strongly suggests have evolved through the repurposing of wing serial homologs, and explores how innovation may be facilitated and biased if it relies on the re-use of preassembled morphological structures, their developmental underpinnings and gene networks. The outcomes of this effort will be contrasted to those of the second major objective, which explores how innovation is enabled and directed in circumstances when large scale exaptation of pre-existing modules is not an option. This second objective will utilize the head horns of horned beetles as a focal trait, which lack even remote homology to other insect structures, and which preliminary data show evolved in the absence of large scale repurposing. Contrasting the outcomes of both objectives will afford assessment of the distinctness and commonalities of both routes of innovation with respect to biases, constraints, and resulting developmental architectures. This work will be executed using comparative RNAsequencing and surveys of gene function across multiple species selected based on their phylogenetic positions and the degree of innovation embodied by their focal traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet corals have suffered widespread global death in the last 50 years due to diverse and interacting threats including heat stress, overfishing, algal overgrowth, pollution, disease, runoff, coastal construction, dredging, changing water chemistry, and habitat loss. Because corals generally grow very slowly, their current reproduction, survival, and growth rates cannot keep pace with the ongoing losses. This project will target the complex and compelling challenge of coral reef restoration through Convergence Research. Specifically, the project will bring together expertise, methods, and researchers from engineering (materials and mechanical) and biology (microbiology, coral reef science, and geobiology) to make transformative advances in coral reproduction and juvenile survival through materials engineering for coral restoration. This program may have impact on coral reef restoration and restoration science, and also on the economies and communities that depend on these ecosystems to support tourism and fisheries. The outcomes of this research may have broad impact in fields outside of coral reef science, including aquaculture, surface fouling, ocean engineering, drug discovery, biomaterials, and microbial biofilm research. The project will support the training of three graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher. To inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, diverse public outreach activities will focus on coral reef science, marine conservation, and education about combining engineering and biology to create powerful tools for ocean health. <br/><br/>This research tackles a fundamental problem blocking coral reef recovery: juvenile recruitment and survival. Currently, corals suffer from widespread recruitment failure and over 98% of coral settlers outplanted for restoration die within two years. Altering coral population dynamics can shift reef systems back toward desirable organisms (corals, coralline algae, herbivores) and away from harmful competitors (pathogens, macroalgae, turf algae, cyanobacteria). The project will use a large-scale, iterative, convergence-based approach to engineer novel substrates for coral propagation. The team will design, fabricate, and test a diverse array of substrates using materials novel to coral restoration. After substrates are deployed to the reef, the performance of each will be assessed by measuring surface microbial community composition; coral larval exploration, attraction, and attachment rates; coral larval settlement rates; ecological community composition; and coral juvenile recruitment, growth, and survival. These data will be measured using metagenomic sequence analysis, experiments with swimming coral larvae, custom-built fluidics systems, ecological community assessments, and skeletal density and microbial community analyses of coral recruits. Substrate characteristics that maximize positive biological outcomes will be incorporated into second-generation substrates with further diversity of millimeter-scale features. The top-performing substrate characteristics will be incorporated into 3D substrates for coral restoration and tested against materials traditionally used in coral propagation. Convergence Workshops will foster the integration of coral biology and engineering, providing hands-on experience in 3D modeling, materials fabrication, and coral propagation. Results will be disseminated broadly through a website, social media, conferences, journal articles, and outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultimately it is the brain that must ?decide? what the cues mean and how to respond.  The goal of this study is to understand how the brain integrates different types of environmental cues to regulate the timing of reproduction.  The researcher will accomplish this using the garter snake to examine how temperature cues stimulate neural regulation of reproductive activity. Garter snakes are especially robust for these studies because its reproductive behavior is regulated exclusively by temperature. Furthermore, Thamnophis sirtalis has one of the most extensive ranges of any ectotherm in North America, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and from east to west coasts. Thus, garter snakes provide a relatively simple yet powerful framework for understanding why (and how) animals respond differently to the same environmental cues. Specifically this project uses a combination of molecular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to determine if temperature-induced reproductive behavior is regulated by changes in thyroid hormone metabolism within the brain. This project will broaden the participation of undergraduates in science education and outreach, with the ultimate goal of improving the scientific aptitude of the community. Additional broad impacts include training diverse students in integrative research, critical thinking, and community engagement.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that temperature-induced activation of the reproductive axis is controlled by neural thyroid hormone metabolism.  The research will use a combination of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, pharmacological manipulation, radioimmunoassay, and behavioral testing to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) Identify the influence of low temperature dormancy on the neuroendocrine GnRH system; (2) Determine if temperature-induced reproductive behavior is regulated by changes in thyroid hormone metabolism within the hypothalamus; and (3) Determine if variation in the temperature sensitivity of reproductive regulatory mechanisms mediates differences in reproductive timing.  This project will advance the understanding of the neurobiology underlying plasticity in reproductive timing, and should reveal mechanisms that may be impacted by climate change.

However, the molecular basis of visual attraction, i.e. the genes, molecular pathways, and neural circuits that integrate visual cues and direct a behavioral response towards a stimulus, has not been characterized as fully. Work on Heliconius butterflies has shown them to be primarily visual, with mate selection specifically mediated by simple visual cues. This project will utilize these unique features of Heliconius butterflies to characterize the fundamental biological process of visual mate choice. The research is likely to have a variety of broader impacts on science and society. Because divergence in color pattern and mate choice causes speciation in Heliconius butterflies, this research will provide an integrative analysis of the functional mechanisms responsible for the origin of species. Finally, a major educational outreach component of the project will implement new teaching and learning activities for students at secondary, undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>The fundamental goal of this research project is to characterize the molecular basis of visual mate choice spanning the continuum from organismal biology and behavior all the way to specific neural circuits and functional mutations.

These nutrients are transported across plant cell membranes and organelle membranes inside of each plant cell.  Transporters are proteins that mediate the passage of virtually every molecule and ion across plant cell membranes. Many natural variants of transport proteins have been shown to be important for key agronomic traits associated with plant growth and yield, and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses.  However, the fundamental biochemical, functional, and structural characteristics of these proteins are largely unknown. To address these questions and the glaring need for new tools in this research area, we are establishing a new center called the Center for Research on Plant TransporterS (CROPS), devoted to the functional and structural characterization of plant transporters prioritized by their agronomic importance. This center will leverage an existing advanced research infrastructure to produce purified plant transporters on a large-scale and rapidly discover/generate novel single-domain antibodies that can be used as valuable tools and potentially transformative and enabling resources for the greater plant science community. In addition, CROPS will determine the molecular structures of key plant membrane transporters and their natural variants, providing a new framework for understanding their functions in the context of their in planta roles, underpinning agriculturally important traits in diverse crop species.<br/><br/>Our understanding of plant transporters has increased dramatically over the past quarter century. This has led to a growing awareness that plant transporters play important roles in many agronomic traits, such as efficient acquisition/use of water and nutrients and crop tolerance to adverse soil environments arising from salinity, acidity, and the presence of heavy metals. Natural genetic variation is the foundation for breeding a wide variety of agriculturally relevant traits. Understanding how genetic variation translates into transporter structural and functional changes is critical to provide for a more efficient exploitation of this variation in crop improvement.  CROPS will focus on key questions regarding agronomic traits that relate to food security and sustainability under marginal conditions and human health/nutrition and food safety. Specifically, through external collaborations and internal expertise, CROPS will target key transporters including those involved in micronutrient acquisition, aluminum tolerance, phosphorous acquisition efficiency, nitrogen acquisition efficiency, salt tolerance and pathogen and insect resistance.  As a first step, CROPS will establish an efficient pipeline based on proven technologies for the production of plant membrane transport resources for the plant scientific community.  These resources include large quantities of purified plant transporter proteins, a powerful in vitro production platform for nanobodies, novel synthetic single-domain antibodies, and state-of-the-art structural determination techniques.  CROPS has a strong commitment to providing access to all data and biological resources to the broader plant membrane transport community.  Access to proteins, antibody reagents, and information about protein structure will be provided through a project website/database and by dissemination through long-term repositories.  Specifically, all structural x-ray and EM structural data (GC and MS) will be deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org) and the EMDataBank (http://www.emdatabank.org).   All plant and synthetic nanobody DNA sequences will be annotated and deposited in GenBank and Gramene.  Plasmid constructs will be deposited in Addgene (https://www.addgene.org), a not-for-profit plasmid repository.   With regard to outreach, CROPS will provide mechanisms for inviting the wider community to tap into its pipeline as a basis for their own research. Researchers will be invited to submit nominations for specific plant transporters of interest. Graduate students and postdocs will receive training and access to some of the most state-of-the-art techniques in rapid antibody (nanobody) evolution, membrane protein structural/functional biology, and molecular-based trait analysis for advancing independent careers. CROPS will have a strong emphasis on providing research training and laboratory experiences to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, with a focus on development of writing and presentation skills as well as mentoring students to take personal responsibility and gain scientific educational and project management skills."

Second, technological advances have resulted in microscopes that can simultaneously image an entire ""sheet"" of this brain, thereby enabling rapid acquisition of whole brain volumes. Third, researchers are taking steps to educate neuroscientists to acquire these data. Together, this will result in a massive upswing in adoption of this experimental modality. However, acquiring the data is one step in the upward spiral of science that will yield transformative scientific results. The subsequent steps are computational. This project will develop cyberinfrastructure resources and software that enable storage and access of large CLARITY brain imaging datasets, alignment and registration to reference anatomical atlas and visualization of the datasets. Additional capabilities for automatic identification and localization of cell bodies and statistical analysis will be provided. The PIs will run annual hackathons for college students and sponsor a summer internship program for undergraduates to broaden the educational efforts in software development for neuroscience.

A one week long Workshop on Molecular Evolution, a ""hands on science"" experience that guides participants from initial hypothesis, to experimental design and data collection, analysis and interpretation, and finally to publication will be a part of this project.  In addition to collecting data necessary for this project, the Workshop will simultaneously demystify the scientific process and the university environment for high school students and teachers alike."

Electric fishes exhibit many interesting characteristics or phenotypes, but very little is known about how these phenotypes are encoded in the genetic material or genome. Understanding this relation is a broad goal in 21st century biology.  Electric fish offer a singular advantage in trying to understand the link between the genome and the phenotype it produces: two groups of electric fish evolved independently in Africa and South America, providing a system where biologists of all stripes can attack genotype-phenotype questions with built-in replication.  There is a growing amount of electric fish genomic data; however, there are no functional tools to investigate this connection.  The purpose of this project is to develop a robust, accessible, and easily transferable genetic manipulation toolbox for the electric fish model system full range of questions under investigation, regardless of a researchers' background. The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, and the second phase of the project will be to disseminate knowledge gained by developing web-based software for sharing protocols, data, and resources, and to train the next generation of electric fish biologists--undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds--in the use of these techniques in preparation for careers in science and technology. <br/><br/>The proposed project, is divided into two phases.  The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, with the specific aims to: (1) generate stable mutant and transgenic lines of electric fish using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, (2) express transgenic material using viral-mediated techniques, and (3) knockdown specific endogenous gene activity using morpholinos.  The second phase of the project is dissemination of knowledge and community infrastructure improvement, with the specific aims to: (1) establish and distribute genomic resources and tools that enable the community to target genes of interest and (2) disseminate protocols developed in Phase 1 by broadening participation in the field and training the next generation of electric fish biologists to harness these powerful new techniques.  The project accelerates significantly research on genotype-phenotype interaction across the full range of NSF-IOS priority areas because it combines the power of genomic manipulation and a globally accessible model system with extensive phenotypic data that span biological levels of analysis from molecules to populations.   Examples of such studies include: (1) insight into ion channel function (2) identification of transduction molecules in electrosensory systems, (3) identification of developmental mechanisms governing the repeated evolution of electroreceptors and electric organs, (5) optogenetics-enabled dissections of brain circuits (6) link genetic changes and the evolution of reproductive isolation.   An outcome of this project is the enablement of the electric fish community to develop new and exciting hypotheses and projects spanning the gamut of biological disciplines, and act as ""ambassadors"" to other non-canonical model systems to apply newly developed techniques."

This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>To achieve lower production costs for rice the current agricultural trend is to shift from transplanting seedlings to direct sowing of seeds. Those seeds may have to germinate under anaerobic conditions due to flash flooding. The study of complex genetic variation and physiology in rice under anaerobic germination is necessary to produce seeds with traits that can fulfill societal and agronomical needs.  The training objectives in this project are to: 1) learn experimental and analytical approaches for genome association analysis of complex trait variation; 2) learn data analysis approaches that involve genome association and physiology data using machine learning implementation; and, 3) participate and lead outreach activities for minority groups and develop a multi-year curriculum focused on food security with Maureen Joy Charter School in Durham (NC). <br/><br/>This project will study complex genetic variation and physiology of anaerobic germination (AG) in rice natural populations, by using new analytical methods to integrate diverse functional information to identify complex trait loci in genome wide association studies (GWAS). These methods can be applied to a range of traits in genetically tractable species. The main research goal is to identify candidate genes that influence quantitative variation for AG in rice, and to determine their mode of action. Specific objectives are to: 1) use GWAS to identify candidate genes associated with AG in sequenced rice genotypes; and, 2) determine the physiological and genetic correlations that contribute towards AG in rice.

The field is now positioned to use this knowledge to explore the natural genetic variation that contributes to plant immunity and to apply it to crop improvement. This project takes advantage of the interaction of tomato with a pathogen that causes bacterial speck, an economically important disease that decreases the marketability and yield of fresh-market and processing tomatoes. This interaction is a powerful system for understanding disease resistance because both the plant and the pathogen are experimentally tractable. In addition, a vast source of natural genetic variation exists in wild relatives of tomato, all of which can be crossed to cultivated tomato. The goal of this project is to leverage this natural variation to identify genes that play a role in plant immunity, characterize these genes using molecular methods, and introduce them into fresh-market breeding lines that are important parents in two public tomato improvement programs. An important aspect of the project is the improvement and promotion of VEGEVADERS, a game to entertain and teach high school students and the broader public about the science and importance of plant-pathogen interactions. The enhancement of disease resistance in fresh-market and processing tomatoes could lead to decreased use of pesticides thus saving growers money, reducing the impact of disease control on the environment and providing food for consumers with fewer pesticide residues. <br/><br/>Diseases of crop plants have major economic and environmental impacts because they decrease yields and require extensive pesticide applications. The overarching goal of this project is to take advantage of the natural variation present in tomato and its wild relatives along with the extensive genome sequence data available to discover new genes/loci that contribute to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The molecular functions of these genes will be investigated by using CRISPR-mediated mutations and other approaches and selected genes/loci will be introgressed into two foundational fresh-market tomato breeding lines. Specifically, the objectives of the project are to: 1) screen 200 tomato heirlooms, breeding lines, and wild species accessions for natural variation for PTI using pathogen elicitors and engineered P. syringae strains with different effector repertoires; 2) identify novel PTI-associated loci/genes and develop DNA markers for use in two tomato breeding programs; 3) develop 150 tomato lines with CRISPR-mediated alterations in candidate immunity-associated genes and characterize them for PTI responses; 4) introduce novel sources of disease resistance into two fresh-market tomato breeding lines and investigate the molecular functions of PTI-associated loci/genes; and 5) enhance VEGEVADERS, a game based on plant-microbe interactions, expand functional genomics web resources, develop a plant breeding workshop, and promote educational outreach. Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs will be trained in bioinformatics, plant breeding, plant pathology, and functional genomics. Knowledge generated in the project will both enhance the understanding of the plant immune system and lead to tomato varieties with improved disease resistance. All data and resources will be accessible to the public upon request and through long-term data and germplasm repositories."

What are the mechanisms that enable perennial plants to adjust to environmental changes, and how does the belowground part of the plant contribute to responses at a whole plant level? In perennial woody crops, including grapevine and most fruit and nut trees, grafting is a surgical enhancement that splices together the stem of the shoot system (scion) with the stem of the root system (rootstock), often joining different genotypes or species into a single plant. Grafting enables the development, clonal propagation, and distribution of perennial crops into new and diverse environments by separating breeding efforts for shoots and roots. This project uses grafted grapevines and genomics to produce a systems-level understanding of how rootstocks modify scion phenotype and plasticity. Results have implications for the national and global grape industry, and woody crops in general, by advancing understanding of the genomic basis and genetic architecture of the influence of the root system on shoot system phenotype. Integrated education and outreach include training post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers in rural and urban locations in Missouri and South Dakota, bolstered by a strong collaborative relationship with the USDA-ARS Grape Genetics Research Unit and industrial partner Ernest & Julio Gallo Winery. Related outreach activities addressing sustainable agriculture, crop evolution, and biodiversity are planned at the Missouri Botanical Garden and U.S.  Botanical Garden. <br/><br/>Clonally propagated, grafted crop species provide the optimal study system for understanding the ability of the root system to modulate shoot system phenotypes across variable climates. Grapevine is an exceptional model for this work with a sequenced and annotated V. vinifera reference genome, reference transcriptomes for wild grapevine species, bioinformatic pipelines for SNP discovery and transcriptome analyses, high-throughput phenotyping methods, and research and production vineyards in diverse environments. This project focuses on root and shoot interactions in grapevine leveraging: 1) an existing common garden research vineyard in Missouri, to analyze inter-annual phenotypic variation in a common scion growing ungrafted and also grafted to three different rootstocks; 2) commercial vineyards across disparate environments of California, to assay environmental influences on root-shoot communication; 3) a new segregating rootstock mapping population replicated in four climatic zones and grafted with a common scion, to characterize genotype x environment interactions of scion phenotypes modulated by the root; and 4) academic and industry partnerships, to conduct extensive interdisciplinary training and outreach. Comprehensive phenotypic data (RNAseq, physiological, metabolic, and morphological) will be generated. Given increasing interest in perennial crops as important components of sustainable agriculture, this project offers a valuable in-depth look at genetic and environmental bases of phenotypic variation in in long-lived plants, a fundamental challenge in biology with important applications in crop improvement. Data generated in this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity to produce genetic x environment interaction models and systems biology analysis of the genetic contribution of rootstocks to scion phenotypes. All data will be made accessible to the public through long-term repositories."

Some of these changes are associated with local human activities, and some are associated with broader climate changes. Increases in salinity are expected to have important impacts because many aquatic organisms evolved in and require low-salinity environments. Ecologists report that increases in salinity adversely affect some groups of aquatic organisms (e.g., aquatic insects such as mayflies, a focus of this project) that are ecologically important and serve as a primary food source for fishes and birds. Thus, modest increases in salinity could greatly affect both the biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. This project is designed to better understand how and why different aquatic insect species vary in their ability to thrive in waters of different salinity. The research will advance understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which salinity affects the metabolism, growth, and survival of aquatic insects, and, ultimately, their distributions and abundance. Project results will help local, tribal, state, and federal water resource agencies and their constituents and stakeholders better interpret monitoring data on aquatic insects, which are widely used as indicators of water quality and ecological conditions.  At least three graduate students and several undergraduate researchers will be supported and trained in the project, and the investigators will contribute to K-12 curriculum development related to water quality and ecological physiology.<br/><br/>The project will expose a new mayfly model species to short-term and long-term salinity gradients to establish how gene expression patterns, oxygen consumption, hemolymph chemistry, and gill physiology link to measures of fitness. Using comparative methods, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the efficiency of ion uptake in dilute environments and the ability to curtail excessive ion uptake in ion-rich environments are key osmoregulatory characteristics that can shape salinity niches. The investigators further hypothesize that the energetic costs of ion transport interact with temperature to influence growth, fecundity, and mortality to define species-specific salinity niches, the expression of which in nature can be observed from niche analyses of field survey data. The study will significantly advance understanding of how both natural variation in salinity and human-induced changes in salinity contribute to organismal performance and species distributions in an increasingly salty world. By integrating different levels of biological organization (genes to biodiversity patterns) and laboratory and field work, the project should significantly advance the synthesis of physiology and macroecology. The project will also help establish and evaluate a promising and needed model aquatic insect species, and will provide foundational understanding of osmoregulation differences across taxa that will inform the use of aquatic insects as ecological indicators of environmental change. Graduate and undergraduate student trainees will be supported, high-school teachers will conduct summer research and develop relevant curricula, K-12 science curricula that integrate science, management, and policy aspects of water quality will be developed and tested, and public outreach workshops will be held for federal and state agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the evolutionary transition from dinosaurs to birds, jaw muscles shifted positions, bony connections were lost, and intracranial joints became increasingly flexible. Studies supported by this award will analyze the evolution of jaw muscle forces within the cranium of non-avian and avian dinosaurs using novel 3D computational methods. These findings will allow the estimation of intracranial joint loading during feeding in extinct taxa and explore the evolution of individual jaw muscles in cranial function. The results will be integrated with neuroanatomical data to uncover the coevolutionary relationships between the brain and feeding apparatus. New 3D models of the dinosaur feeding apparatus will provide the template for numerous future studies of cranial functional morphology in other vertebrates. This work will complement and provide the necessary foundation for multi-body dynamic models of vertebrate feeding, will provide guidance for material properties testing and XROMM analysis, chondral modeling of cranial skeletal tissues, and will develop 3D datasets that can be used to test patterns of cranial modularity and skull function.

Perhaps the best-known human superspreader was Typhoid Mary, who caused 53 deaths due to Salmonella bacteria transmission.  Although the frequency of ""Typhoid Marys"" is unclear, they are probably not rare.  Superspreading is implicated in the rapid expansion of SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and HIV across the globe.  For most infectious diseases, 20% of hosts cause 80% of infections.  The goal of this research is to determine whether glucocorticoids, major vertebrate stress hormones that have been implicated in disease transmission, are involved in superspreading.  Stress hormones could impact superspreading by affecting how parasites (or vectors, such as mosquitos and biting flies) choose hosts on which to feed, how hosts resist or tolerate parasites, or how hosts transmit parasites to other hosts or vectors.  Surprisingly, there has never been a systematic study of the effects of stress hormones on all aspects of one complex host-vector-parasite system.  This knowledge gap is significant and deserves attention because many anthropogenic and natural factors alter stress hormone regulation, and these factors are increasingly important in the context of global change. By knowing how and when stress hormones affect host-parasite interactions, we may become better able to predict and control zoonotic disease outbreaks.  <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: To investigate the role of stress hormones in superspreading, interactions among zebra finches (ZEFI), Culex pipiens mosquitos, and West Nile virus (WNV) will be studied. WNV was chosen because it has decimated some songbird populations and is thought responsible for more than 33,000 human infections and 1150 deaths. ZEFI and Culex were chosen because their genomes have been sequenced, providing opportunities for strong experimental approaches. Stress hormones are predicted to impact i) ZEFI behavior to Culex exposure, ii) Culex blood-feeding preference on ZEFI, iii) ZEFI resistance to WNV infection, iv) ZEFI tolerance of WNV infection, and/or v) ZEFI competency to transmit WNV to Culex. Ultimately, data will be used to determine directly when stress hormones have the largest impacts, information valuable for human and wildlife populations.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:  In animals, superspreading appears important for the transmission of several zoonotic diseases (infections that spill from animal into human populations) such as West Nile virus and some hantaviruses. In the context of global change, basic research on understanding superspreading has significant societal value because zoonotic diseases are predicted to become more prevalent. Collaboration with the Tampa Museum of Science and Industry, which attracts more than one million guests annually, will include the development of a Science Works Theater that helps the public understand disease ecology.  Training workshops for Hillsborough County high school teachers will also be held, providing teachers tools to train incipient scientists in modern disease biology.  For USF students, about 40% of whom come from under-represented backgrounds, robust learning experiences will be provided.  Individuals on the project will learn animal husbandry, minor surgeries, how to work in a high-security infectious disease research facility, modern lab assays, data analysis, and scientific writing."

The PI's laboratory recently discovered metabolites capable of altering the normal dorsal-ventral fate of select stem cells in the early frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo, demonstrating that these molecules, too, are active players during patterning of the vertebrate body. The overall goal of this work is to determine the mechanism of action underlying metabolite-induced cell fate decisions. This will be accomplished through a systems cell biology approach, in which the molecular state of metabolite-injected cells will be characterized using unique single-cell mass spectrometry technologies that were developed and validated in the PI's laboratory. The project will identify how cell-fate altering metabolites perturb close-proximity metabolic networks as well as key proteins of metabolism and known signaling pathways of dorsal-ventral specification. Two single-cell mass spectrometry instruments will be used to perform flux analysis for the injected metabolites and to measure the relative translation of targeted proteins in fluorescently tracked cell clones that form from the metabolite-injected cells in the living frog embryo. The resulting data will identify gene candidates for functional tests via gene knock-down experiments to validate the proposed mechanism of action for metabolite-induced cell fate changes. Understanding small-molecule effects on cell fate commitment raises broad implications in diverse areas of the life sciences.  The work will also train underrepresented groups in techniques bridging biology and analytical chemistry."

The surface lipids on the stigmatic silks of maize are biologically unique because they are rich in hydrocarbons, which are the inert end-point metabolites of the surface lipid network. This project will utilize maize silks as the model biological system to provide a fundamental understanding of this unique, discrete metabolic process by comprehensively dissecting within a single organism the metabolic and genetic networks that produce important surface lipids. Moreover, this project will elucidate the specific surface lipid constituents of maize silks that provide critical protection against environmental stresses (water stress and insect feeding) that commonly impact crops like maize during the often-stressful period of pollination. All metabolite and transcriptome data will be deposited in the Plant Metabolomics Resource database (metnetdb.org/PMR) and the latter will also be deposited in the NCBI-SRA and NCBI-GEO databases. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) data will be searchable at MaizeGDB (http://maizegdb.org/qtl.php) and made available at the integrated web portal for QTL dissection, GeneNetwork (genenetwork.org). Seed stocks for quantitative genetic mapping populations will be deposited at the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).<br/>A significant societal impact of this project will be enhancement of the sustainability of US crop production via increased crop yields and/or decreased inputs. The identification of the protective surface lipids and the genes that produce them will provide the technological know how for applied breeding of customized lipid compositions that protect against many stresses, both in corn as well as in other crops. Further, the chemical similarity between silk surface lipids and petroleum components will be leveraged for applications in network bioengineering to produce advanced biofuels in other biological systems. During the project, >400 high school and college students from diverse socioeconomic, geographic and ethnic backgrounds will be exposed to hypothesis-driven research via three synergistic programs: A) a collaboration with Iowa State University's SCIENCE BOUND program will engage diverse secondary school students in scientific education via hands-on research modules; B) two SCIENCE BOUND students will conduct summer-research projects together with a high school teacher from a rural or high needs district and with a student from Chowan University, a 4-year undergrad institution with significant minority enrollment. These research experiences will help the teachers better engage an even larger number of students in scientific inquiry; and C) a discussion-based undergraduate course will be developed to serve as a bridge between fundamental knowledge learned through coursework and the application of that knowledge for conducting scientific research."

In many of these systems, the mechanisms that produce this variation are poorly understood, limiting the ability to understand how selection acts on communication signals to facilitate the speciation process.   Electric fish, such as mormyrid fishes from Africa, produce weak electric fields for the purposes of communication and navigation through their environments.  There are more than 200 species of mormyrid electric fish; most species have a specific electric discharge, and the mechanisms underlying the production are well understood.  In this project, the researchers seek to identify the genetic basis of electric signal diversity by leveraging the recent discovery of a ""hybrid zone"" between populations of mormyrid electric fish with distinct electric signals to identify genes responsible for differences in electric signals.   The project will draw on next-generation genomic sequencing technologies, as well the development of new transgenic techniques in electric fish.  This research is important because electric discharges are critical in species recognition, and identifying genes responsible for behavioral differences within species will ultimately help biologists understand how changes in behavior can facilitate, or perhaps cause, one species to become multiple species.  In connection with this work, this project will establish a new educational outreach program, focusing on ""forms of energy,"" to middle school students in Olivet, MI.<br/><br/>The more than 200 nominal species of mormyrids produce easily measured and quantified electric discharge signals (EODs), which have a discrete anatomical and physiological basis.  EOD signals are typically species-specific and have been demonstrated to be a necessary component of courtship behavior, particularly for a rapidly evolved ""species flock"" of mormyrids in the genus Paramormyrops.  Recent work has focused on linking these macroevolutionary patterns of electric signal diversity to population-level processes.  Recent discoveries have identified a population level polymorphism in EOD signals within the species Paramormyrops kingsleyae that reflects macroevolutionary patterns of EOD diversity in Paramormyrops and other mormyrids.  The objective of this project is to determine the genetic basis of divergent signals in P. kingsleyae.  The researchers will achieve this objective by completing three specific aims.  The first aim is to determine the divergent genomic regions between sympatric, polymorphic species of electric fish by assembling a reference P. kingsleyae genome, and then align low-coverage whole genome resequencing data from individuals with divergent EOD types.  The hypothesis is that these divergent genomic regions between populations are responsible for differences in EOD complexity.  The second aim is to identify patterns of gene expression correlated with EOD complexity among closely related Paramormyrops species.  The hypothesis is that differences in EOD complexity will be associated with changes in expression of genes relating to electrocyte cell shape and structure.  The third aim is to test the putative effects of candidate genomic regions and/or changes in gene expression identified by interfering with gene function in vivo.  By achieving these three aims, this project will provide the first demonstration of the genetic basis of a vertebrate communication behavior.  EOD diversity is maintained by P. kingsleyae despite the fact that both signal types are maintained in sympatric, fully interbreeding populations.  These differences represent the same EOD characteristics that have been strongly implicated in the evolution of reproductive isolation between species and genera. The outcomes of this project will contribute broadly to understanding how evolutionary novelty arises in natural populations, a substrate for speciation. This project will enhance infrastructure for research by constructing web-based tools for exchanging phenotypic and genomic data in electric fish on the website http://efishgenomics.zoology.msu.edu.

However, drought resistance and yield tend to be inversely correlated. The rate that water flows through the stalk of plants on its way to the leaves is a critical variable in explaining differences in drought tolerance between different varieties of plants. However, current technologies for measuring the rate of this flow are bulky and can damage the plant when they remain applied for long time periods; thus they are not able to monitor plants throughout a growing season. In addition, the data collected from current sensors requires measurements of stem size in order to accurately measure flow rates.  If stems grow over the course of the experiment, these measurements can introduce error is. This project develops a wearable plant sensor that enables accurate long-term quantification of flow rates across many environments and genotypes. Large numbers of low-cost sensors can be deployed in breeding programs enabling direct evaluation of lines.  From these lines specific genetic loci controlling variation in sap flow rates under different environmental conditions can be identified. Likewise data from these sensors can be used in genomic prediction models that prioritize new breeding lines prior to the investment of resources field trials. This research will enhance workforce development by providing research opportunities to next-generation researchers at the intersection of engineering and plant science. <br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate advances in sensors, microsystems, nanomaterials, and plant sciences to realize a novel sap flow measurement method that ultimately advances functional genomics research and the breeding of drought tolerant crops. The objective is to develop a wearable plant sensor for long-term, accurate, and affordable monitoring of sap flow over an entire growing season. The sensor design allows efficient thermal insulation of the microscale sap flow sensing unit from external environments, thus eliminating the traditional need of additional bulky thermal insulation setup and increasing the response to sap flow. Spatial averaging of multiple sap flow measurements around the stem enhances measurement accuracy. By using stretchability of the sensor materials and structures, physical constraints of the sensor on plant growth is minimized for long-term monitoring. The proposed wearable sensors can be manufactured at large scale and low cost, allowing it to be incorporated into breeding programs tolerating drought tolerance. Lastly, the sensors are characterized, calibrated and validated over time using gravimetric measures of plant water use in the greenhouse. Initial pilot field measurements are performed, where the sensors are applied to several maize hybrids grown under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions as part of the Nebraska contribution to Genomes to Fields (an existing public-private partnership).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Jered M. Wendte is ""The Epigenomic Consequences of Increased Heterochromatin Load in Maize"". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Georgia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Robert J. Schmitz.<br/><br/>A major problem facing humanity is the production of an adequate food supply for an exponentially increasing population. One promising strategy to address this problem is the modification of crop plant genomes to produce crop varieties with higher yields and desirable traits through genome engineering. Plant genomes are comprised of several long stretches of DNA, termed chromosomes. Each chromosome encodes thousands of genes, which provide the blueprint of an organism. This project will advance genome engineering technologies in the important cereal crop, maize, by evaluating two potential genome engineering strategies. The first involves the possibility of adding entirely new chromosomes to maize as a means to introduce desirable traits that are encoded by multiple genes. The second involves adding genes that encode proteins that chemically modify DNA to maize as a means to increase trait diversity in maize, which can then be selected on for desirable traits, such as drought or disease resistance. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, and science communication.  Broader impacts include participation in existing programs directed at introducing Hispanic and Native American communities to opportunities in plant genomics sciences. <br/><br/>Epigenetic modification of chromatin plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability by targeting repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs), for heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. In plants, which are characterized by relatively large genomes mostly comprised of TEs that are targeted for heterochromatin formation, heterochromatin also plays an important role in phenotypic diversity. Between plant species, there is remarkable variation in the amount and distribution heterochromatin modifications within genomes. Also, within species, heritable changes in chromatin state, or epialleles, account for an important source of phenotypic variability. However, mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, including factors that influence variation in overall heterochromatin capacity and the initiating events that lead to epiallele formation, are currently lacking. Using advanced genomics techniques and novel genetic resources in maize, this project will address these knowledge gaps by 1) determining if a cell?s capacity for heterochromatin is limited, and what factors could be rate limiting by assessing the impacts of the introduction of large, multi-megabase quantities of genetic material in the form of supernumerary B chromosomes on maize heterochromatin structure; and 2) identifying the determinates of methyltransferase targeting and their role in the initiating events of epiallele formation by assessing the heterologous expression of DNA methyltransferases in maize.  All data will be made available through public repositories including NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the host laboratory website (http://schmitzlab.genetics.uga.edu/data). If successful, this project will provide new important information that can be applied to help guide crop genome engineering design strategies for artificial chromosomes that have minimal detrimental impacts on heterochromatin regulatory pathways. Project outcomes will also help assess the potential of strategies for modulation of the epigenome to induce phenotypic variability that can be selected on for desirable traits.<br/><br/>Keywords: maize, epigenetics, DNA methylation, heterochromatin, artificial chromosomes, genome engineering<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these changes are associated with local human activities, and some are associated with broader climate changes. Increases in salinity are expected to have important impacts because many aquatic organisms evolved in and require low-salinity environments. Ecologists report that increases in salinity adversely affect some groups of aquatic organisms (e.g., aquatic insects such as mayflies, a focus of this project) that are ecologically important and serve as a primary food source for fishes and birds. Thus, modest increases in salinity could greatly affect both the biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. This project is designed to better understand how and why different aquatic insect species vary in their ability to thrive in waters of different salinity. The research will advance understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which salinity affects the metabolism, growth, and survival of aquatic insects, and, ultimately, their distributions and abundance. Project results will help local, tribal, state, and federal water resource agencies and their constituents and stakeholders better interpret monitoring data on aquatic insects, which are widely used as indicators of water quality and ecological conditions.  At least three graduate students and several undergraduate researchers will be supported and trained in the project, and the investigators will contribute to K-12 curriculum development related to water quality and ecological physiology.<br/><br/>The project will expose a new mayfly model species to short-term and long-term salinity gradients to establish how gene expression patterns, oxygen consumption, hemolymph chemistry, and gill physiology link to measures of fitness. Using comparative methods, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the efficiency of ion uptake in dilute environments and the ability to curtail excessive ion uptake in ion-rich environments are key osmoregulatory characteristics that can shape salinity niches. The investigators further hypothesize that the energetic costs of ion transport interact with temperature to influence growth, fecundity, and mortality to define species-specific salinity niches, the expression of which in nature can be observed from niche analyses of field survey data. The study will significantly advance understanding of how both natural variation in salinity and human-induced changes in salinity contribute to organismal performance and species distributions in an increasingly salty world. By integrating different levels of biological organization (genes to biodiversity patterns) and laboratory and field work, the project should significantly advance the synthesis of physiology and macroecology. The project will also help establish and evaluate a promising and needed model aquatic insect species, and will provide foundational understanding of osmoregulation differences across taxa that will inform the use of aquatic insects as ecological indicators of environmental change. Graduate and undergraduate student trainees will be supported, high-school teachers will conduct summer research and develop relevant curricula, K-12 science curricula that integrate science, management, and policy aspects of water quality will be developed and tested, and public outreach workshops will be held for federal and state agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific, regional, gender and ethnic diversity of the participants will broaden participation and expose participants to diverse social and scientific cultures. Through the synthesis of empirical science and modeling, new knowledge can be generated and used to inform key stakeholders including policymakers, land managers, and the general public. Finally, the workshop will promote teaching, training, and learning and thereby increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.<br/><br/>This workshop will advance discovery and understanding by fostering integration and synthesis of knowledge spanning from genomes to populations. This understanding is essential to the creation of quantitative models for predicting animal resilience and vulnerability to rapid environmental change. Modeling across levels of biological organization is inherently integrative, interdisciplinary and transformative. The objective of the proposed workshop is to coalesce biologists and modelers working at different levels of biological organization who typically do not interact. The goal is to establish a new collaborative network of scientists with expertise that spans from genomes to populations to facilitate development of novel quantitative approaches to address the urgent challenge of predicting how vertebrate species and populations will respond to a changing environment.

For example, predators attacking highly coordinated fish schools have little success due to how efficient information transmission is in the group. The technological challenges of filming and tracking large groups of animals have limited our understanding of how they are so effective at predator avoidance, but recent advances in computer vision and high-speed filming now allow us to accurately recreate these information transmission networks and show how information moves through animal groups. Insights into these networks have put forth predictions that are at odds with long-established hypotheses on where in the group animals are safest: classic behavioral ecology theory suggests the center, while new network data suggests the edge of the group. The research carried out here will for the first time test these competing hypotheses. Live interactions between a northern pike predator and schools of golden shiners will be filmed in the laboratory and then recreated from a sensory network perspective using sophisticated computer vision software to better understand how information is transferred and the ramifications of individual location in the group. The experiment will provide insights into the fields of behavioral ecology, sensory ecology, game theory, and network science. It will provide scientific and statistical training to graduate and undergraduate students, and findings will be disseminated at scientific conferences, through blogging, and through science outreach to local high schools.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>For decades, Hamilton's Selfish Herd theory has served as the expectation for the spatial distribution of predation risk in animal groups. In this model, cohesive grouping emerges as animals move to position other individuals between themselves and a potential hidden predator, hence minimizing their ""domain of danger"". Support for this theory has been mixed for mobile animal groups such as fish schools, however, because the Selfish Herd theory does not allow for prey to respond to the predator. Real predator-prey interactions, on the other hand, are dynamic. Until very recently, directly testing Hamilton's Selfish Herd theory in fish schools has been impossible due to technological limitations on the quality and quantity of behavior data. Recent advances in computer vision and high-speed cameras, however, now allow for accurate measures of the fine-scale movements of all members of fish schools, as well as estimations of the visual information available to them. Networks constructed from this visual information are an accurate predictor of how movement decisions transfer through schools of fish. Here research will directly test the non-exclusive hypotheses of whether spatial positioning or network structure is a more accurate predictor of mortality risk by filming predator-prey interactions between golden shiners and a northern pike predator in the laboratory."

The data will be helpful to forests geneticists working on oaks throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and it will also provide new insight about the evolution of adaptation to climate and contribute to the current understanding of which parts of the genome are important in adaptations to different environments, and which provide information important in managing oak forests under climate change.  <br/><br/>The ability of plants within the same species to grow across heterogeneous environments is a major topic for plant science. Given the rapid rate of climate change, the ability of long-lived plant populations to respond to these changes is an urgent question. The major goal of this project is to use state-of-the art whole-genome sequencing approaches to develop genomic resources for understanding local adaptation of valley oak (Quercus lobata) to different environments, as well as provide a resource to the broader scientific community and natural resource managers. Taking advantage of unique features of this keystone California oak, this project will (1) provide a complete, high-quality sequence of the valley oak genome with structural and functional annotations of genic regions and repetitive elements; (2) whole-genome sequences and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 190 trees from natural populations, and (3) candidate SNPs that are under natural selection along climate environments, which will contribute to understanding local adaptation to climate and provide further annotations relevant to environmental adaptations. In addition to addressing the fundamental question of how individual plants adapt to different climates, a long-term significance is that the project will provide new knowledge on how genomic diversity can respond to changing climate conditions.

Likewise data from these sensors can be used in genomic prediction models that prioritize new breeding lines prior to the investment of resources field trials. This research will enhance workforce development by providing research opportunities to next-generation researchers at the intersection of engineering and plant science. <br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate advances in sensors, microsystems, nanomaterials, and plant sciences to realize a novel sap flow measurement method that ultimately advances functional genomics research and the breeding of drought tolerant crops. The objective is to develop a wearable plant sensor for long-term, accurate, and affordable monitoring of sap flow over an entire growing season. The sensor design allows efficient thermal insulation of the microscale sap flow sensing unit from external environments, thus eliminating the traditional need of additional bulky thermal insulation setup and increasing the response to sap flow. Spatial averaging of multiple sap flow measurements around the stem enhances measurement accuracy. By using stretchability of the sensor materials and structures, physical constraints of the sensor on plant growth is minimized for long-term monitoring. The proposed wearable sensors can be manufactured at large scale and low cost, allowing it to be incorporated into breeding programs tolerating drought tolerance. Lastly, the sensors are characterized, calibrated and validated over time using gravimetric measures of plant water use in the greenhouse. Initial pilot field measurements are performed, where the sensors are applied to several maize hybrids grown under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions as part of the Nebraska contribution to Genomes to Fields (an existing public-private partnership).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will carry out a series of comparative gene expression analyses across homologous and analogous organs within Classes and across Kingdoms in order to determine whether there are shared, and perhaps universal, gene expression networks regulating the development of planar appendages. The data and insights may enable the development of new fundamental concepts in biology. This project will also enhance student learning in undergraduate and graduate courses and provide  opportunities for participating undergraduate students to develop their critical thinking.

This fact suggests that there must be additional, presently undefined, emergent GRNs that are required for planar development. The experimental design is based on comparative transcriptome analyses between planar and non-planar homologous organs and planar and non-planar non-homologous, analogous organs in selected lineages of angiosperms and arthropods.  These comparative analyses will seek to detect regulatory modules at different levels and help identify shared and perhaps universal toolboxes governing the development of planar structures.  Data from RNAseq libraries will be mapped to de novo assemblies to quantify expression, and to determine gene functional identities. Expression counts of genes will be comprehensively analyzed to identify functional co-expression gene networks.

They play important roles in grain yield and biomass accumulation, and understanding the genetic signals that regulate the number, size and fertility of tillers is of critical importance for optimizing yield potential in the world's major food, animal feed and biofuel grass crops. In addition, the initiation of tillers is important for perenniality in many grasses, and as such, full knowledge of the tillering pathway will contribute to the development of perennial biofuel and grain crops. The panicoid grasses are immensely important for all of these uses, and the full suite of genes that comprise the tillering pathway and the components that have been selected during domestication are largely unknown.  This project exploits evolutionary variation and changes during domestication in three panicoid cereals (maize, sorghum and foxtail millet) and their wild, highly tillered ancestors to uncover the genetic regulation and evolutionary modification of tillering.  Forward and reverse genetic approaches and transcriptomic analysis in both ancestral and domesticated backgrounds will provide insight into the gene networks necessary for growth and development of tillers in panicoid grasses. It is anticipated that the results from this comparative project will extend to and inform experiments across a wide range of agronomically important taxa.<br/><br/>In addition to training postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students, this project aims to immerse high school science teachers from rural schools and from areas serving high proportions of underrepresented student populations in a research environment that will be combined with professional development activities.

Participation in PAMM NET will be open to the public, and will begin with the unification of four independent and international projects funded through the joint NSF-JST Metabolomics for a Low Carbon Society program.  This unification will further amplify NSF's current investment in plant, algae and microbial metabolomics, and will be achieved through regular videoconferences and annual face-to-face program meetings and workshops.  This team will serve as a nucleus to build forth a more unified national and international PAMM NET that will identify and pursue solutions to the key challenges that still impede the full potential of metabolomics.  This will be facilitated through the recruitment of a network coordinator who will serve as a dedicated advocate for the organization, facilitate integration, and provide logistical support for consensus reporting of the network outcomes.  The initial nucleus and the network coordinator will then recruit public participants from the US and global plant, algae, and microbial metabolomics communities to build working focus groups.  These focus groups will actively discuss the current grand challenges associated with metabolomics and potential solutions to these challenges.  The PAMM NET recognizes that many challenges will need the involvement of the larger biology, technology, and bioinformatics communities and PAMM NET will therefore recruit feedback and active participation from these diverse groups to best formulate empirical solutions to the grand challenges.  PAMM NET will further contribute to the development of a US National Chapter of the Metabolomics Society to better serve and provide long-term solutions for the needs of the US metabolomics community.  PAMM NET will build a repartee with other federally funded programs such as the NIH-supported National Metabolomics Centers to better coordinate efforts across federal funding divisions and scientific disciplines.

These programmatic workshops will include hands-on demonstrations of different aspects of metabolomics research that will range from the use of sophisticated chromatographic, mass-spectrometric and NMR-based tools for metabolite analysis, to computational and statistical analyses and interpretation of metabolomics data. In addition, this RCN will organize and support an annual workshop associated with international plant biology or metabolomics meetings (e.g., Annual Meeting of the Metabolomics Society or the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Plant Biologists).

However, the direct linkages of vein traits to whole plant performance are not completely understood.  This project will test and extend current theory for the role of leaf veins in plant function, using the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will determine the genes underlying different vein traits and how these lead to higher-level functions including water transport and growth. This work will result in discoveries of how genes determine plant function, create resources for improving plant productivity, and clarify the evolution of natural species, with critical impacts in the fields of plant physiology, ecology and genetics. Numerous undergraduate students will be integrated into the project, receiving training is scientific methodology and data analysis. The project includes the creation of a new web resource to enable K-12 students, teachers, and members of the public to conduct their own analyses to estimate how vein properties affect plant function. The work aims to advance national prosperity and welfare through applications in agriculture and ecological sustainability and education of science students and the public in plant biology.<br/><br/>Leaf venation is increasingly recognized as important to plant performance, with applications from agriculture to paleobiology. This understanding is based on comparative studies across diverse plant species, which showed that major structural features of leaf venation influenced leaf gas exchange. However, the theory for the importance of vein traits has not yet been tested rigorously in a model system, such as A. thaliana. Vein mutants have been identified with leaf phenotypes showing altered vein cross-sectional anatomy, spacing, patterning and/or connectivity. The project will utilize both leaf vein mutants and natural ecotypes previously subjected to genomic sequencing in a combination of physiological experiments, modeling, and genetic analyses. Hypothesized mechanistic trait linkages and genome-wide association of traits will be measured to address two research questions: (1) How do leaf vein traits influence hydraulics, gas exchange and growth? (2) What are the genetic loci associated with leaf vein traits, and how do they determine higher-level function across A. thaliana genotypes? The project breaks new ground in the ability to model how gene sequence determines key plant traits that scale up to whole plant function. The integrative approach will provide new insights into plant physiology and genetic architecture and set the stage for numerous further analyses at the intersection of these fields. Broader Impacts work will capitalize on the great appeal of leaf venation for scientists, students and laypeople. In collaboration with undergraduate students and under-represented high school students, a crowd-sourcing website will be created, ""VenationNation"", to provide unique resources for researchers, citizens and students to become involved in leaf venation research.  The site will contain downloadable images of leaf vein systems and protocols to calculate and interpret vein traits with self-teaching and course curricula. This site will increase the involvement of citizens and students in science, provide resources for teaching, create pathways toward understanding of principles of plant science, and aid in the global dissemination of the research."

This work predominantly has focused on how the song system allows male songbirds to learn and produce song. The role of this circuit in female songbirds, which do not sing, has largely been ignored. Rather than acting as a circuit that generates vocal behavior, this work investigates the hypothesis that the ""song system"" in females serves to organize preferences for males' songs and guides their behavioral reactions to song in the form of a copulation solicitation display that ensures survival of the species. The project capitalize on the robustness, selectivity, and social malleability of the copulatory behavior in the brown-headed cowbird, to investigate how the song system transforms a sensory stimulus (the song) into a motor command that controls a postural response. The project also provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in interdisciplinary research, and it includes science education activities aimed at elementary school children as well as a comprehensive summer course in neuroscience for high school students.<br/><br/>The proposed work integrates disparate fields of science, including neuroscience, behavior, and engineering to provide unique insight into the evolution of neural circuits that control behavior. In the first aim, the investigators use a combination of classic pathway tracing techniques and recently developed transsynaptic tracer (vesicular stomatitis virus) to map the connectivity from the forebrain to the individual muscle groups that are activated during the production of a copulation solicitation display (CSD). In the second aim, the investigators record neural activity in forebrain song control nuclei HVC and RA during the production of CSD in female cowbirds to quantify the nature of the forebrain motor commands that control this highly selective sexual behavior. To evaluate the relationship between recorded neural activity patterns and the behavior, we will use a computer vision approach to quantify the copulatory behavior. In the final aim of the proposal, the investigators record neural responses to song in higher-order auditory forebrain areas (NCM, NIf, CM) within the context of CSD production. These experiments serve to test the hypothesis that these forebrain areas, which have known projections to song control nuclei, encode song valence and provide a direct link between song quality and the females' behavioral response. The neural and behavioral data will be made available at public internet site dedicated to Song Bird Science."

Specifically, out-of-season frosts damage crops costing billions of dollars annually, and restricting growing seasons to avoid potential frosts likely costs in the tens of billions. Also important, the global population is expected to rise and the need to grow more crops on the same land is immediate. Poor understanding of freezing tolerance mechanisms constrains development of more tolerant crops. This project will ultimately provide new knowledge that can guide strategies to engineer freezing tolerance in crop plants. An enzyme named ""Sensitive to Freezing 2"" (SFR2) is known to help plants survive freezing by changing the building blocks of chloroplast membranes. Although SFR2's action is known, the way that SFR2 is activated to respond to freezing conditions and the way that its actions provide an advantage are only hypothesized. This project tests the hypotheses using a unique blend of genetics, biochemistry, and biophysical approaches. It is expected that the results will immediately enhance efforts to generate cold-tolerant crops and will also impact research on membrane temperature stability in other species and engineering systems. Throughout the project, training of Nebraskan post-doctoral researchers and graduate students in plant science will be improved to include public communication and other convergent skillsets. In doing so, members of the general public in Nebraska will also benefit.<br/><br/>An enzyme known as Sensitive to Freezing 2 (SFR2) remodels the chloroplast envelope membranes by reducing monogalactolipids and increasing oligogalactolipids. Plants expressing catalytically inactive point mutants of SFR2 are more susceptible to freezing than wildtype plants. Recent evidence from the investigator's lab indicates that SFR2 is activated during freezing by cytoplasmic acidification. Acidification of the cytoplasm also occurs during other stresses in which SFR2 is not active. This and other data suggest that SFR2 activity is tied to a more global cellular response to freezing temperatures in which it directly stabilizes the chloroplast envelope membranes by altering their physical properties. This project will test this hypothesis through the following objectives: (1) Define how membrane stability is affected by SFR2-dependent changes to lipids. (2) Determine if SFR2 activity is repressed by post-translational modification. (3) Define the diversity of chloroplast envelope membrane freezing stabilization mechanisms. These objectives identify mechanisms allowing membrane integrity during freezing temperatures and define how they work (Obj. 1, Obj. 3), and they define a critical cellular freezing signal (Obj. 2). Finally, they will also provide a comprehensive understanding of chloroplast envelope stabilization mechanisms useful in multiple fields. The following training and science literacy objectives are integrated with the above research: (4) Provide comprehensive training for next-generation scientists to be effective researchers and communicators.

The model system for this research is the interaction between toxic Pacific newts (Taricha) and their resistant predatory garter snakes (Thamnophis).  Newts are defended by tetrodotoxin (TTX), one of the most lethal toxins ever discovered.  This neurotoxin binds to the outer pore of voltage-gated sodium channels, the proteins responsible for propagating electrical impulses in muscles and nerves, thereby paralyzing muscle and nerve organs.  Despite this, multiple garter snake species feast on newts, in large part due to specific changes to the sodium channel protein expressed in muscle.  However, these adaptive variants likely bear a high cost; biophysical work on sodium channels suggests that amino acid mutations that reduce TTX binding to the protein are likely to reduce sodium channel function.  If this tradeoff scales to the organism, then it may explain why TTX resistant garter snakes are geographically localized, and have not swept across the landscape.  Further, this tradeoff may explain why resistance-conferring mutations in snakes represent only a small subset of mutations known to reduce TTX binding to the protein.  Nevertheless, the cost of naturally occurring protein variants remains unexplored, as does any relationship between this biophysical tradeoff, tissue function, and organismal performance.  Using a truly integrative approach, the investigators will: 1) quantify the apparent tradeoff in this molecular adaptation; 2) determine how resistance to prey toxin and biophysical tradeoffs scale up to the tissue; and 3) determine how tissue resistance and performance in different organs (muscle and nerve) combine to determine the adaptation of the snake.  This research will provide a framework for understanding how a tradeoff at the molecular level can influence an individual's response to its environment, ultimately impacting adaptive evolution and species interactions across the landscape.  The study provides a tractable model with a clear ecological context to help determine when and why adaptive evolution may be limited, as well as the possible downstream consequences of those constraints on adaptation.<br/><br/>The project will lead to training of two graduate students and several undergraduates in a highly integrative investigation where they will participate in molecular data generation, protein analysis, physiological assays, and whole organism performance trials, all in the context of predator-prey coevolution.  The research themes of this project will be extended to an outdoor education program for families from Reno, Nevada.  This project will sponsor 5 inner-city families to participate in a weekend-long outdoor program where they stay at a field station and explore the biodiversity and ecology of forest ecosystems that exist only 30 minutes from the urban setting in which they live. Applications will be made available to elementary and middle school children engaged in the UNR Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement program (MESA). MESA strives to engage low-income, first-generation students and will be an ideal conduit for identifying students that have interest in science but with financial needs that would otherwise preclude attendance of a program like Family Camp.  The PI has chosen a family-based model because he has observed that exposing an individual child to this nature-based experience has a much higher and longer-lasting impact if their immediate family participates as well.  This model provides a set of positive, shared family experiences that can be remembered and reinforced, creating a supportive environment as the child continues to develop and explore an interest in science.  Such educational opportunities are particularly rare in an EPSCoR state like Nevada but will have significant impact on promoting biodiversity and organismally-based research and education in our community."

We know very little about the cellular mechanisms that enable rapid actions of CORT, or about the ability of CORT to affect context-dependent effects. A long-term goal of the research is to identify and characterize the multiple rapid effects of CORT on those neurons that have clear behavioral relevance. The proposed research will use in vivo single-unit and slice whole cell electrophysiology, behavior, and imaging to investigate the following questions: (1) How do hormones impact neurons on different timescales to affect the selection of context-appropriate behaviors? and (2) How do small ephemeral signaling molecules, endocannabinoids, behave as the switch upon which hormones act? Findings from these studies promise to elucidate two novel mechanisms in which CORT modulates intrinsic electrical properties of behavior-associated neurons and receptor-mediated endocytosis of behavior-regulating hormones. Furthermore, this research offers four significant broader impacts: (1) Advancing discovery and understanding while promoting authentic teaching, training, and learning, because student-training is integrated with teaching at all levels and is developed through a combination of research-based courses and collaborative student-faculty research; (2) Participation of underrepresented groups is actively encouraged through a highly impactful workshop to develop science self-efficacy, and by attracting underrepresented students through collaboration with PNW-LSAMP. (3) Enhancement of infrastructure for research and education through collaboration with an assessment expert to develop tools and methods to evaluate learning outcomes, and development of an imaging workshop for novice faculty and students in the region; (4) Broad dissemination of the findings of this work through public lectures, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed publications."

The root system of a plant is typically composed of a main root with multiple branches and the branching pattern has substantive impacts on the plant's performance. This project focuses on discovering the mechanisms that determine where along the main root the branch roots will be placed. The PI recently discovered that the pattern of root branching varies as plants progress through different stages of their life cycle. Coincident with an early change in the pattern of root branching, the arrangement of leaves in the shoot also changes, raising many questions about how the positioning of leaves and roots is controlled and coordinated. The results of this work will enhance the United States' position as a leader in scientific research by adding to the understanding of fundamental principles that guide plant growth and may contribute to the ability to breed plants with higher yields or enhanced acquisition or use of water or nutrients such as nitrogen. The project also will contribute to training the next generation in science and technology by directly involving undergraduate students in the research, a practice that has been shown to be effective in recruiting and retaining students in science.  The project will also support laboratory research experiences for area high school students, who will be mentored by the PI and undergraduates, further extending the project's educational and scientific impact.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph: <br/>Distinct phases of development have long been recognized in plant shoots. In contrast, the potential for phase-dependent changes in root development receives little attention, although changes in meristem size and root thickness are known to occur. New data from the PI's laboratory show that the positioning of lateral roots varies as the root matures, and that proteins that direct auxin transport affect these stages differently. In addition, loss-of-function of several genes that affect lateral root positioning also affect the time at which plants switch from a juvenile to a mature pattern of leaf arrangement. This project will: (1) establish the timing of developmental changes that take place in the root and test the hypothesis that genes known to control phase change in the shoot also control phase in the root. It will also (2) investigate genetic and molecular interactions between the identified genes and test hypotheses as to how regulation of organ spacing in the root and shoot are coordinated. This project will increase the opportunities for undergraduates to actively participate in science through the PI's laboratory, through a credit-bearing course that will be revised to make involvement in this research the centerpiece of the educational experience, and through opportunities for travel to a leading plant developmental biology laboratory outside of Oberlin. The PI and undergraduates will also partner with the local public high school, bringing multi-day investigative experiments to the high school and creating opportunities for motivated high school students from underrepresented groups to work in the PI's laboratory."

These achievements include DNA sequences and measurements of traits relevant to productivity and quality for large numbers of varieties within individual crop species, powerful computational approaches and data management tools, increasingly detailed molecular understanding of plant biology including responses to the environment, and new methods to precisely test the function of particular DNA sequences. Building on these resources and tools, this project will address the longstanding challenge of identifying DNA sequences responsible for traits that vary in a quantitative way, called ""quantitative trait loci"" (QTL), and making them amenable for crop improvement.  While QTL are key determinants of crop productivity, they have been exceedingly difficult to study, and very little is known about them. This project focuses on QTL for disease resistance, disease susceptibility, and tolerance to acid soils in the globally important crop species, rice. The project will isolate DNA sequences associated with high levels of these traits and test whether those sequences are responsible by moving them into rice varieties that show low trait levels and measuring the result. The project will improve understanding of crop resistance to stresses caused by pests and poor soil conditions and lead to improved crop productivity. More broadly, the project will establish effective ways to connect variation across individuals with the DNA sequences that cause that variation, which will be useful not only for plant research, but other life sciences, including medicine. The project will further benefit society by integrating its research objectives with educational activities and materials that will engage and inform the public and increase participation by members of underrepresented groups. These include a combined classroom and research experience program for small-college undergraduates, training workshops for plant biologists, multi-media educational resources to engage middle and high school students, and a project web site (www.ricediversity.org) for public access to project-related materials, publications, and data. Moreover, the project will foster the development of diverse junior personnel into independent scientists<br/><br/>Compilations of genomic and other genotypic as well as phenotypic and associated metadata for large numbers of rice, powerful informatics approaches and data management tools, the unprecedented ability to precisely edit plant genomes to probe gene function, and increasingly detailed molecular understanding of rice responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, together provide a foundation for this project. This project applies large-scale statistical genetics and genome editing technology to examine distinct QTL for disease resistance, disease susceptibility, and acid soil tolerance. Building on genomic and phenotypic data, computational methods, and infrastructure generated under previous NSF awards and elsewhere, including the recently released genome sequences of 3,000 rice accessions, the project will connect genotype to phenotype for each trait, using genome editing to functionally evaluate isolated genetic polymorphism in new genetic backgrounds. Co-variation will also be examined for each trait to test for genetic background effects on allele viability, and in the case of disease susceptibility and resistance, allelic variation in pathogen-targeted genes will be queried for evidence of purifying or positive selection. Findings will be used to expand the tools and the collection of genotypic and phenotypic data associated with the project, and tailor these resources for the community, while improving understanding of and the ability to enhance plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Under the outreach objectives of the project, the combined classroom and research experience program for small-college undergraduates will integrate computational and molecular biology aspects of the proposed research and include summer internships in the research laboratories at Cornell. The training workshops will focus specifically on genome editing for plant biologists, especially those from underserved and underrepresented groups; the multimedia educational resources will include stories, podcasts, and interactive web modules and will be distributed through major media outlets; the project web site (www.ricediversity.org) for scientists, the general public, and educators will provide access to project-related materials, protocols, publications, and data (data will be released on or before publication of analytical results). Finally, the development of diverse junior personnel into capable, creative, and collaborative independent scientists will be fostered by a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary research environment."

Being able to predict a threat that occurs seconds or minutes after an environmental cue allows for evasive or defensive action. Despite considerable progress towards understanding how memories are formed, many questions remain, such as how the brain learns about events separated in time. This project uses cutting-edge tools in neuroscience to address a previously intractable problem about how brain systems function on a second-by-second basis to link events in memory. This contribution is significant because it is expected to identify key principles of brain function that will advance our understanding of more complex forms of learning and memory. Undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups in science (women and minorities), participate in data collection, analysis, and dissemination. This project also provides an opportunity to develop educational tools to help stimulate interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields within the broader community. These tools include an interactive demonstration of neuronal activity and brain stimulation for annual outreach efforts to high schools in the greater Milwaukee, Wisconcin area. <br/><br/>Nearly all forms of motivated behavior require the association of events that are separated in time, but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms supporting these associations, highlighting a critical gap in the study of memory: how are sensory inputs integrated in memory when they do not overlap in time? The principal investigator recently revealed a causal link between a neural signature of working memory in the prefrontal cortex and the formation of long-term fear memory. The objective of this project is to determine how an auditory cue held in short-term working memory systems within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is associated with shock inputs in the amygdala to drive plasticity and adaptive fear responses. With the recent development of optogenetic tools, it is now possible to interrogate the function of discrete patterns of firing in specific neural connections. Here, the investigators leverage this tool in combination with electrophysiology in awake, behaving animals to determine when short-term mnemonic information is integrated with sensory input during memory formation. Given the importance of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus for the adaptive use of memory to guide behavior, a hallmark of executive function, determining how mnemonic input from these structures is integrated in downstream brain areas informs the understanding of a broad range of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors."

Identifying the causes of differences in the stress response requires understanding how the stress response varies within and across populations, and how these differences affect survival and reproduction. Organisms respond to a diversity of stressors through behavior and physiology, and this response is important for coping with immediate threats, yet it can also impose substantial damage. Stress resilience is the rapid and effective termination of the stress response and may be an important predictor of the capacity to persist in changing environments. This research will address how stress responsiveness and stress resilience affects fitness across a range of environments. The results of these experiments could significantly advance understanding of the traits that drive vulnerability to stressors and adverse health outcomes, and help to predict the potential for individuals, populations, and species to persist in a changing environment. This research will be integrated with education and outreach in several ways. A partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's education program will produce accessible and engaging multimedia pieces on how organisms, including modern humans, cope with stress. These materials will be designed to enhance public interest in science, and to provide a standards-based resource for use in secondary schools and undergraduate biology courses nationwide. The research team is also collaborating with local environmental groups and researchers at each study site to develop field-based public outreach programs.<br/><br/>The researchers engaged in this collaborative project will experimentally manipulate phenotype and exposure to stressors in a widely distributed songbird, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), to determine whether variation in specific components of the stress response are causally linked to behavior, phenotypic damage, gene expression, and fitness. Novel techniques that enable the manipulation of the hormonal stress response in free-living and freely-behaving birds will be coupled with advances in remote monitoring and tracking to reveal the detailed behavioral changes and fitness effects of variation in the hormonal stress response. The potential for selection to shape the efficacy of negative feedback will be assessed by estimating the heritability and consistency of trait expression within and across seasons. Coordinated experiments across four populations that breed in differing environments from Alaska to Tennessee will address how variation in specific components of the stress response influence the ability to survive and reproduce in the presence of stressors. The data obtained through this project will be stored in databases maintained by the Principal Investigator and collaborators, and archived through the Cornell eCommons facility. Data will be provided as supplementary material to publications, and made publicly available within five years of the conclusion of the project."

The interaction of speakers and topics will stimulate new insights, hypotheses and collaborations. In turn, these will enhance progress in the field. The symposium will have a SICB-hosted website that will serve as a repository for information on all aspects of the researchers and their work. A minimum of 11 peer-reviewed publications, along with supplementary data, will be published in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology as major products of the symposium. The symposium has a strong commitment to advancing the careers of women in science and employment in higher education and research, as 60% of the speakers are women. A complementary session will provide a platform for early career researchers to disseminate research related to the theme of the symposium. The symposium will lead to development of resources that will be available to students and researchers for many years to come. <br/><br/>Extant early-diverging metazoans (Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Placozoa, and Porifera) have survived in a changing and increasingly complex world, and -omics data are providing novel insights on a diversity of peptides and small molecules that these animals deploy. It is clear that surprisingly sophisticated gene repertoires enable basal metazoans to encode many of the signaling, sensory, defensive and offensive capacities associated with ""higher"" animals. It is now timely to consider how omics methods can be used to resolve how environmental and chemical queues shape phenotypes among the basal metazoans by focusing on how these simple animals have evolved a diversity of chemical responses to environmental stimuli. The aim of this symposium is to develop a post-genomic view on the form, functions and origins of compounds that are biosynthesized in early diverging metazoans in response to environmental cues. <br/>Invited speakers will contribute talks in three general areas: 1) the molecular basis of perception, 2) chemicals deployed to deal with the biotic and abiotic environment, and 3) the molecular cross-talk that characterizes intimate interactions of hosts, parasites and symbionts. Specific topics that will be considered include: toxin diversity, life styles and co-option of chemicals, immune molecules, the chemistry of cellular reception, and sensory complexity in simple animals. The topics of this symposium and resulting interactions of speakers will contribute to a growing picture of comparative functional biochemistry, revealing how chemical mediators have enabled persistence and diversification of simple animals that lack sophisticated morphologies, anatomies and behaviors over geological time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These turtles leave their home beaches as hatchlings and migrate across entire ocean basins before returning years later to nest in the same coastal area where they originated.  How adult turtles navigate to their natal beaches has remained enigmatic, but accumulating evidence suggests that turtles imprint on the unique geomagnetic signature of their natal beach and then use this information to return.  The research will investigate the geomagnetic imprinting hypothesis using a multidisciplinary approach.  Results will assist efforts to conserve animals such as sea turtles that undergo natal homing.  For example, attempts to reintroduce sea turtles to geographic areas where they once nested have been largely unsuccessful because young turtles released in such areas seldom return as adults.  An improved understanding of how turtles find their home beaches may help save these jeopardized species from extinction.  Findings are also likely to reveal new modes of navigation that can be adapted for guidance systems of humans and autonomous vehicles.  Broader impacts include providing research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, broadcasting findings into K12 classrooms through the North Carolina Museum of Natural History, and creating instructional web modules for K12 education, thereby enhancing both science education and public awareness of endangered sea turtles.<br/><br/>The long-term objective of the research is to determine the behavioral and sensory mechanisms that underlie natal homing in sea turtles and other long-distance marine migrants.  The research will test several central predictions of the geomagnetic imprinting hypothesis: (1) behavioral experiments will investigate whether nesting adult female turtles locate their natal beaches using the unique magnetic signature of their natal area; (2) statistical analyses will be used to determine whether the spatial distribution of turtle nests along continental coastlines is affected by fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field, as the geomagnetic imprinting hypothesis predicts; and (3) magnetic orientation behavior of turtle embryos prior to hatching will be studied to determine if imprinting might occur during development.  Results and data will be disseminated primarily in scientific journals; when possible, appropriate data and metadata files will be posted in online supplementary materials or with services such as Dryad, which many journals now support."

This occurs in the origin of life, where clusters of molecules form cells; in development, where initially unspecialized cells form an embryo; and in many other systems, including insect colonies, where an aggregation of small insects generates adaptive group behavior. The same phenomenon also affects humans more directly, where computer clusters, power grids, and people in organizations display unforeseen group-level behavior. This project specifically investigates the behavioral rules that individual units in such groups may use to divide up tasks. Division of labor plays an important role in many collective systems and a systematic understanding of how best to achieve it is lacking. This project will make substantive contributions to the fields of Animal Behavior, Computer Science and Engineering.  Ants will be used as an empirical study system and mathematical models will be developed to generalize findings to a variety of questions, particularly in engineering. Results from this project will be used as a stepping-stone to applied software development. An interdisciplinary teaching program will be developed to train a new generation of biologists and engineers who can make use of insights from both of these fields. Short film documentaries and other teaching tools will engage the general public.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide both detailed empirical data on how social insect colonies generate an efficient and robust division of labor and a broader theoretical framework that will deliver insights on optimized, self-organized task allocation that applies widely across complex systems. Individually marked ants and a semi-automated tracking system will facilitate comprehensive data collection. For example, do fluctuations in the need for work drive changing activity levels? This will show whether the many apparently inactive ants found in colonies are necessary reserves and how flexible task allocation strategies are. The effect of task allocation on insect colony fitness will be directly measured. The development models will be used to predict how inactivity may result from particular strategies and how alternative strategies perform in terms of accuracy, flexibility, robustness and specialization. In distributed computing theory, this work will push the envelope by providing more powerful models that take into account a combination of discrete, continuous, dynamic and probabilistic behavior.

Furthermore, when do these changes in organ function affect properties of the whole organism?  Using the California mussel Mytilus californianus, we ask, when do subcellular changes in gill cells affect feeding rate or changes in muscle biochemistry affect the ability to close their shells? We aim to address these questions by collecting data from different levels of biological organization simultaneously, from the subcellular to the organ and organism levels in response to relevant environmental stressors, such as food availability, heat stress and the inhibition of signaling pathways. The investigators' expertise in comparative environmental physiology and computational mathematics will enable them to address the relevance of subcellular changes to predict organ and organism level changes using a mathematical model. The proposal has a strong training component and is centered on lowering the barriers to molecular and computational technologies and building a diverse community of young scientists in integrative organismal biology. Furthermore, K-12 resources will be developed on the physiological impacts of future environmental change that align with Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.<br/><br/>The specific objective of this study is to develop quantitative, predictive models that uncover the underlying interactions/regulations among subcellular networks (transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic or TMP) and their effect at the phenotypes of the organ and organism in response to environmentally relevant stressors (i.e., low/high food availability and low/high body temperature), based on high-throughput experimental data, in the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus. The experimental design will also focus on testing a possible mechanistic link between food availability and stress tolerance by inhibiting signaling pathways involving sirtuins, which are deacylases that respond to caloric restriction and stress. This proposal distinguishes itself from previous studies on the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms in that it incorporates statistical models (including regression and decision trees) to uncover the regulatory structure of the TMP networks and determine whether the resulting topology accurately predicts observed phenotypic responses measured at the organ and whole organism levels. The PIs' complementary expertise in TMP analyses, integrative biology and computational modeling will enable them to combine ""omics"" technologies, organismal physiology and computational approaches to advance integrative organismal biology. The PIs are planning to disseminate the modeling framework through a research coordination network (RCN) on Integrative Organismal Biology.

This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.<br/><br/>Shedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway."

Precipitation in arid and semi-arid environments can vary strongly within and across years and plant fitness can depend on rapid or efficient utilization of water during these events.  Plant species adapted to arid systems possess numerous leaf, stem and root traits that serve to minimize water stress, but it remains unclear whether these water conservation traits limit a plant's ability to rapidly respond to precipitation events and how water acquisition and conservation traits correspond to plant fitness.  The proposed research is organized around two questions: (1) is there a trade-off between the ability to respond to sudden changes in water availability and a water conservation strategy, and (2) how do traits pertaining to water acquisition and conservation correlate with plant fitness and how does this depend on the magnitude and frequency of precipitation?  These questions will be examined in four annual and six perennial species from a southern California coastal sage scrub community.  <br/><br/>Understanding how biochemical, morphological and physiological processes result in integrated organismal responses to environmental variation will improve predictive models of community response to climate change.  Mediterranean-climate ecosystems are among the regions of the world most likely to be affected by climate change and the proposed work will collect critical information needed to restore these unique, threatened ecosystems.  For example, understanding how species use water under a variety of precipitation scenarios may improve restoration efforts in systems invaded by exotic plant species by allowing resource managers to identify native species that use resources in a similar way, which may increase community resilience to invasion.  <br/>    <br/>This CAREER proposal represents a fully integrated plan of research and education though supervised and independent research (undergraduate, high school summer internships) and courses at the undergraduate and high school level.

While there is a rich history of work focused on the evolutionary pressures that lead to differential pollen performance, we lack a functional genetic understanding of the process. Here, the researchers will exploit the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to define the genetic elements that direct pollen performance, and utilize new microscopy assays to quantify the process of pollen competition. Defining the genetics of pollen performance and modeling the process of pollen competition will transform our ability to intelligently modify crop varieties with resilient and selective pollination systems in the future. This work will be conducted by undergraduate students who will participate in an enhanced research experience through the establishment of on-site multiply-mentored scientific teams that employ an interdisciplinary approach. Student teams, duel mentored by a biologist and mathematician, will coordinate experimental planning, data collection and mathematical modeling to accomplish the research goals of this proposal, and also participate in K-12 outreach to schools in Chicago and Northwest Indiana. Thus, this project offers a large number of undergraduate and K-12 students, many from underrepresented groups in science, the opportunity to integrate mathematical thinking into questions of basic biology, and to do so in collaborative groups. Such work has great potential to expose and recruit students to research professions.<br/><br/>The researchers have previously used recombinant inbred lines and genome-wide association mapping to identify the major loci that influence pollen performance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, they have developed a microscopy approach that allows the visualization and quantification of the behavior of individual pollen populations during competitions. This approach offers the opportunity to quantify how differential pollen performance during pollen competition directs nonrandom mating, as pollen tubes leave a visible trace of their movements, rates and behaviors as they compete to deliver sperm to eggs. In this project, the researchers will identify and characterize the genes responsible for differential pollen performance and how their natural variation influences the process of pollen competition. These data provides, for the first time, the tools needed to mathematically model the process of pollen competition. This work will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how pollen performance influences pollen competition, pollen interference, nonrandom mating and the process of fertilization. The evolutionary significance of this extends beyond plants; there are deep parallels between the well-studied process of sperm competition and pollen competition, yet there are not robust physical models for either.  This study represents a unique opportunity to define the connections between variation in genes and behaviors that can direct nonrandom mating, a process of immense evolutionary significance in sexual organisms."

Despite more than a century of research on plant-virus interactions, control of viral infection remains a challenge to plant health. Unlike most bacterial and fungal plant pests, most viruses depend on insects who serve as ""vectors"" to transmit the virus to the plant cell, often through sucking mouthparts. Thus, a complex three-way relationship develops in which the host plant mounts an immune response that is countered by the virus and its insect vector. Understanding how and when this three-way interaction occurs is thus essential to identify control points of the viral disease. The goals of this research program are to investigate plant responses to infection and to uncover unique collections of genes and biochemical pathways that drive plant-virus-insect interactions in tomato. The results will provide candidate genes for engineering new strategies of virus management, and will establish the tomato-Potyvirus-aphid system as a model for studying three-way disease interactions. The research also provides novel insight into how the natural variation of viral disease is mediated within and across domesticated and wild tomato. High school and undergraduate students will participate directly in research to learn about the genomic-level science underlying viral disease in plants. The project will also encourage cross-disciplinary communication in plant genomics by hosting a summer discussion group at the University of California-Davis focused on plant genomics research.<br/><br/><br/>Nearly every major cropping system faces threats from plant-infecting viruses, and most plant viruses rely on insect vectors for transmission. Although numerous studies have shown that viruses can manipulate plant metabolism to promote viral acquisition and transmission by vectors, few have examined the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating plant-virus-vector interactions and none have developed a system-level understanding of this process. This work builds on the recent discovery that plant viruses respond actively to the presence of insect vectors via host plant-derived signals, promoting insect performance and transmission through changes in plant chemistry.  The aim of this project is to develop a detailed understanding of the genes and pathways that underlie viral ""recognition"" of insect vectors and activation of processes within the host plant that facilitate transmission by insect vectors. Transcript profiling, metabolomics, and bioinformatics will be used to develop a co-expression network and identify key regulators of this phenomenon. Introgression-mapping lines in combination with knockouts will be used to functionally characterize key regulators mediating plant-virus-vector interactions within and across plant species. All data and resources generated in this project will be made accessible to the public through the project website and through long-term data repositories."

Hybrid vigor is a critical component of the high productivity of many crops, including maize. While hybrid vigor has been efficiently employed in many crops, we lack a basic understanding of how it works. A better understanding could provide novel avenues for the improvement of hybrid vigor, and for extending its benefits to non-hybrid crops. This project will develop new approaches for discovering sets of interacting genes from the inbred parents. Knowing the identity of those genes will make it possible to use them as predictive tools and as targets of manipulation for crop improvement. The project will provide a model for using predictive gene network-based approaches to understand and improve complex traits in crops. Interest in using biological networks for crop research is growing, but access to the necessary technical capabilities remains limited. Therefore, the project will also provide plant scientists with free technical and analytical services with an emphasis on crop genomics-enabled research. These services will range from consultation on experimental design to data interpretation, ensuring that results are useful and capacity is not wasted. Training investigators who wish to become plant biological network experts will be the project's highest priority. Two to three undergraduate students will provide the services. These students will be trained in chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, and engineering so that they can support users in sample preparation, data generation, and network analysis.<br/><br/>This project will create unsupervised gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and protein kinase networks (PKNs) for two maize inbreds (B73, Mo17) and their hybrid (SX19). GRN modules are comprised of a transcription factor (TF) and its target genes. PKN modules are comprised of a protein kinase and its substrates. The GRN s will be made using three different proxies for TF activity: TF mRNA abundance, TF protein abundance, and level of TF protein phosphorylation; network targets will be measured by the levels of all mRNAs. The PKN will be made using phosphorylation of the activation-loop as a proxy for kinase activity; network targets will be measured by protein phosphorylation levels of all proteins. All measures will be made on 26 different tissues. GRNs will be constructed using the GENIE3 random forest algorithm. The PKN will be made using our previously described correlative method. We will measure the preservation and divergence of modules between the inbreds and their hybrid. We will test whether inbred-specific or hybrid-specific modules contribute to heterosis. Selected near­ isogenic lines (NILs) derived from SX19 with introgressed segments containing module regulators will be test-crossed to the donor parent. The Fl will be exactly like SX19 except for the segment containing the regulator, which will be homozygous. Comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of SX19 to the test-crossed NIL will reveal whether the regulator is acting on its targets as predicted by the network. If the module contributes significantly to heterosis then hybrid vigor will be reduced in the test-crossed NIL."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nathanael Ellis is ""Identifying molecular networks underlying root-root interactions in high plant density adapted maize."" The host institutions for the fellowship are the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the Washington University School of Medicine, and the lead sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christopher Topp, with co-sponsoring scientist Dr. Yuan-Chuan Tai.<br/><br/>Since the 1930's, annual gains in U.S. maize production have largely been driven by the adaptation of maize plants to increasing plant density. Two historically important maize populations, Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic and Corn Borer, have been recurrently selected for increased hybrid grain yield, resulting in density adapted plants. Preliminary work suggests that not only have root architectures changed in these populations, but their sensing and growth responses to neighboring root systems have changed as well, pointing to a new paradigm for understanding the key process of crop density adaptation. This project aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to high plant density in maize roots. Thus the research will contribute to our basic understanding of how roots, the ""hidden-half"" of plants, communicate with one another, and exploit this knowledge for crop improvement. The broader impacts include synergistic training between plant biologists and medical imaging experts, as well as leveraging the project research objectives to develop teaching tools in a classroom experience for underserved students. Training will include: bioinformatics, genomics, advanced image analysis methods, analysis of complex 3D structures, and statistical approaches to quantify the dynamics of plant metabolism.<br/><br/><br/>Shoot architectures, specifically increased leaf angles, are known outcomes of selection during maize density adaptation, but little empirical data exists about the contribution from roots. Selected cycles from progressively density adapted germplasm will be assayed in several ways to quantify root system architecture of plants grown individually or paired, to identify changes in root growth as a function of density adaption. In this project, the effects of density adaptation on 3D root architecture and growth will be assayed by Optical Projection Tomography (OPT), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to study dynamic carbon allocation. These efforts will identify the most relevant time points from which to sample leaf and root tissue for transcriptional profiling, as well as profiling of root exudates via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This project will contribute to modelling the relationship of carbon allocation and root growth in respect to root-root communication and to identify the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling these processes. Results from this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as communicated at scientific conferences. Data will be uploaded to appropriate publicly accessible websites, including the NCBI Sequence Read Archive in association with the maizegdb.org/expression database, as well as the Proteomics Identifications database."

It appears from recent research that previously described hemoglobin/genetic adaptations exert very modest effects on oxygen acquisition and are insufficient alone to explain the success and activity levels of deer mice at high altitude. Deer mice also display changes in organ sizes (e.g., heart, lung) that vary along the altitude gradient and are correlated with improved aerobic performance necessary for high levels of activity. This project will investigate the extent to which changes in lung size and function contribute to the observed increases in activity in adult mice acclimated to high altitude. Students will participate in all data collection aspects of the proposed research and contribute to the development of educational modules for undergraduate classes and outreach efforts to the public and citizen science workshops in the Southern California region.  Results from the study will be further disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings.<br/><br/>Preliminary data from the principle investigator's lab suggests that the capacity of the lung to deliver oxygen at high altitude is the first critical limit in the oxygen cascade and that, in deer mice, the lung has the capacity to remodel to meet that demand.  Such pulmonary plasticity would be highly adaptive if species are moving upward in elevation as the climate becomes warmer.  This project will therefore test the hypothesis that some animals have the capacity to remodel lung architecture and optimize function throughout their lives.  Changes in the cardio-pulmonary tissues between the high- and low-altitude acclimated mice will be assessed through histologic and physiologic assays.  Modified gas composition will be used in direct respirometry tests of lung performance in control (normoxic) and altitude-acclimated animals.  Lung volume, alveolar surface area, capillary density and blood gas composition will be tested to determine the extent to which organ size, architecture, and composition changes contribute to high altitude acclimation.  Results from this study will inform our understanding of how small mammal populations that are forced to move to higher altitudes and harsh or variable conditions as a result of climate change will cope with their relocation."

This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.<br/><br/>Shedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway."

Extensive field study sites have already been established on Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, where over 300 breeding pairs have been genotyped for the MHC class 2B gene. The aim is to characterize the individual odor profiles of these genotyped birds using state-of-the-art chemical techniques developed for human scent discrimination. Specific research objectives are a) to test whether individual birds produce odor signatures related to their MHC-genotype, b) to determine if birds use MHC-related scent marks to label their home burrows,  and  c) to determine whether the scent of an individual bird is an indicator of individual quality, health and fitness, or plays a role in mate choice decisions. Showing that any species of bird uses MHC-related odors in mate choice decisions would represent a paradigm shift in how biologists think about mate choice decisions in birds, and will provide insights relevant to avian immunology and health in a wide-ranging species.

Identifying the causes of differences in the stress response requires understanding how the stress response varies within and across populations, and how these differences affect survival and reproduction. Organisms respond to a diversity of stressors through behavior and physiology, and this response is important for coping with immediate threats, yet it can also impose substantial damage. Stress resilience is the rapid and effective termination of the stress response and may be an important predictor of the capacity to persist in changing environments. This research will address how stress responsiveness and stress resilience affects fitness across a range of environments. The results of these experiments could significantly advance understanding of the traits that drive vulnerability to stressors and adverse health outcomes, and help to predict the potential for individuals, populations, and species to persist in a changing environment. This research will be integrated with education and outreach in several ways. A partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's education program will produce accessible and engaging multimedia pieces on how organisms, including modern humans, cope with stress. These materials will be designed to enhance public interest in science, and to provide a standards-based resource for use in secondary schools and undergraduate biology courses nationwide.

Novel techniques that enable the manipulation of the hormonal stress response in free-living and freely-behaving birds will be coupled with advances in remote monitoring and tracking to reveal the detailed behavioral changes and fitness effects of variation in the hormonal stress response. The potential for selection to shape the efficacy of negative feedback will be assessed by estimating the heritability and consistency of trait expression within and across seasons. Coordinated experiments across four populations that breed in differing environments from Alaska to Tennessee will address how variation in specific components of the stress response influence the ability to survive and reproduce in the presence of stressors. The data obtained through this project will be stored in databases maintained by the Principal Investigator and collaborators, and archived through the Cornell eCommons facility.

To build an organ, multiple steps occur as the embryo develops, both to make all the different types of cells needed for that organ, and to organize these different cells so that they can work together to perform the organ's function. A common strategy for organizing cells is through coordinated cellular movements and shape changes. This project aims to understand how each different kind of cell obtains the information it needs to move into the correct places and acquire the needed shape. This process requires that cells recognize each other, assess their current location in the developing tissue, and finally, use information from their environment and/or in their DNA blueprint to navigate through the tissue to the location where they are needed. To understand how cells manage this intricate dance, the investigator will study an example where cells organize to create an organlike structure that develops into a fruit fly egg. A series of precise cellular movements is needed to build the eggshell, which protects the developing embryo. Fly ovaries will be cultured and cell movements will be imaged through the microscope, using genetic and antibody assays to identify the specific proteins that cells use to interact with each other. These studies will be able to distinguish whether the major source of information for a cell's movements come from an internal program or from external environmental cues. The proteins and mechanisms identified will expand the knowledge of the cellular repertoire available to create organized structure in the many different types of organs observed across animal phyla. This research will provide essential scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. They will acquire important skills in teamwork, critical thinking, data management,as well as the needed skills to perform laboratory research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/>The experiments of this proposal will examine the mechanisms by which a migrating sheet of cells can change its direction of migration. The work will focus on oogenesis of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, to take advantage of sophisticated tools for genetic manipulations and new technologies for real-time, time-lapse imaging of cellular movements in ovary explants.  Based on previous research, two models for the mechanisms that induce the change in direction will be contrasted; these models are not mutually exclusive. One model is that each cell decides independently to change its direction, through an intrinsic program of regulated gene expression in response to a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) morphogen gradient. Experiments will test specific candidate transcriptional regulators for their requirements in the onset of specific phases of the new migration. The second model is that the cells respond to an extrinsic signal that reorients their direction or otherwise changes their migration behavior. This aspect of the project follows up on published reports that the BMP response system may use non-transcriptional mechanisms to induce changes in cell shape, as well as preliminary data that another signaling system is modulated in these cells. The investigator predicts that intrinsic gene regulation initiates the competence for a migration response, and that extrinsic signals orient the cells' migratory behaviors. This work will identify the molecular links between developmental gene regulatory networks and the cellular effectors that create the diverse array of functional architecture seen in tissues of multicellular organisms. In addition to these research activities, the investigator is collaboratively organizing a monthly Science Cafe (www.sciencecafes.org) to provide an interactive venue for local and regional scientists to discuss current scientific topics with the general Las Vegas community."

Morphological variation will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometrics.  Mechanical properties will be measured in vitro to provide baseline data to assess the function of cartilage as a structural material.  Strain in living fishes will be measured to examine cartilage performance as a skeletal element, providing a technique and baseline for measuring strain in non-bony skeletal elements.  Finite element analysis will be validated from in vivo species and used to predict strain in those species or structures that are not amenable to in vivo techniques.

The most economically important plant-parasitic nematodes include the cyst forming nematodes. Cyst nematodes form parasitic relationships with their plant hosts by establishing a permanent feeding site within the root, which serves as a nutrient sink to support growth and development of the nematode. This project will provide new insights into how plants recognize and respond to nematode-secreted molecules to form unique and essential feeding cells within host roots, which may, in turn, translate into novel strategies to bioengineer crops with robust resistance to pathogenic cyst nematodes. The investigators seek to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms and pathways by which plant-parasitic cyst nematodes co-opt host developmental programs for feeding cell formation. <br/><br/>Feeding cell development and maintenance is dependent on stylet-secreted effector proteins produced in the esophageal gland cells of cyst nematodes. However, our understanding of signaling processes directing the process of host cell transformation by nematode-secreted effectors is largely lacking. Among the stylet-secreted effectors are small signaling peptides sharing similarity with plant CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides. The investigators have demonstrated that these nematode-secreted peptide signals are required for successful infection, but their exact role in developmental reprogramming of root cells for feeding cell formation remains unclear. The project focuses on elucidating the function of nematode-secreted CLE peptides in modulating the plant cellular program for feeding cell formation. Molecular, genetic, genomic, and biochemical analyses will be used to characterize the role of nematode CLE peptides in feeding cell formation. Once delivered into host cells, CLE proteins are retargeted to the apoplast via a novel post-translational trafficking mechanism. The trafficking pathway will be investigated through subcellular localization and analyses of host-interacting proteins. In the apoplast, CLE peptides are perceived by plant receptors. Receptor localization will be characterized and deletion and mutagenesis studies will be used to evaluate receptor binding specificity to nematode CLE peptides. The hypothesis that CLE peptides act to modulate phytohormone and defense signaling pathways will be tested through cell-specific studies of mutants, reporter lines, and other related assays including nematode infection assays and in vitro peptide application assays. The data generated will provide information about a class of pathogen effectors unique to plant-parasitic cyst nematodes and the first example of a pathogen secreting a protein mimic of a plant peptide hormone. Beyond the cyst nematode-plant interaction, the data generated will contribute to an understanding of CLE signaling and potentially novel protein trafficking pathways in plants. The project will integrate research activities with education and training of female and underrepresented minority undergraduate students in plant molecular genetics and cell biology through outreach programs targeting K-5 focused on applications of plant science and technology for society."

Each axon carries information from one single nerve cell (neuron). As an embryo develops, these fibers have to connect up correctly in order to make working neural circuits. Before these connections can form, the neurons have to move from the place they are born to the location where they will perform their role. Previously, the Principal Investigators have studied this process in the facial nerve, which controls facial expressions, and found that a single ""pioneer"" neuron guides the movement of the remaining neurons to their final destinations. Where do pioneer neurons come from, how do they know where to go, and how do other neurons know how to follow them? This project will address these questions in developing zebrafish embryos (animals with facial nerves similar to humans). Zebrafish embryos are transparent, and the experiments use specially-engineered zebrafish whose facial neurons are fluorescently labeled to make their cell migration visible. Experiments will also examine the roles of particular molecules found on the cell surface that are important for cell migration (cell adhesion molecules). A new kind of 3-dimensional imaging (light sheet microscopy) will be used to measure cell movements, and new software will be developed to visualize and analyze cell movement data. Once developed and tested at the University of Chicago and the Marine Biological Laboratory, these software tools will be made freely available. The project will additionally provide training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students; introduce elementary and middle school students to research; and engage the public via interactive displays at the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI).<br/><br/>Subsets of neurons migrate tangentially within the neuroepithelial plane, often over significant distances. To better understand mechanisms underlying tangential migration that are important for neural circuit formation, this project focuses on facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), which undergo a tangential migration that is conserved in vertebrates ranging from fishes to mammals. The study will utilize zebrafish embryos as they are accessible, transparent, and a powerful genetic model. Migrating FBMNs will be imaged in transparent zebrafish embryos with genetically marked cells, and tracked using light sheet microscopy. The Principal Investigator recently described the pioneer neuron as the first FBMN to migrate on each side of the hindbrain, and demonstrated the critical role of this neuron. Aim 1 will study the newly recognized pioneer neuron by establishing its cellular origins and tracking its subsequent trajectory through development. FBMN tangential migration also relies on interactions with two different pre-laid axon tracts and both interactions depend on adhesion molecule N-Cadherin. Aim 2 will investigate the role of N-Cadherin in mediating interactions between FBMNs and axon tracts, and whether it functions autonomously within neurons during migration. Additional adhesion molecules important for FBMN migration will be identified using RNAseq. An integral part of this project will be the development of new, broadly-applicable computational tools to analyze imaging data."

Preliminary research shows that sonomicrometry, which uses ultrasound to measure deformation, can be used successfully to measure strain in cartilage.  The research will advance our knowledge and understanding about the function of cartilage as a structural material in vertebrates by quantifying strain during in vitro and in vivo loading.  The study will also open multiple avenues of study on other biological materials that are not amenable to traditional strain analysis.<br/><br/>A broad range of chondrichthyan and chondrostean fishes that vary morphologically and kinematically in jaw and hyoid structures will be studied during feeding and ventilation behaviors with five aims. Morphological variation will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometrics.  Mechanical properties will be measured in vitro to provide baseline data to assess the function of cartilage as a structural material.  Strain in living fishes will be measured to examine cartilage performance as a skeletal element, providing a technique and baseline for measuring strain in non-bony skeletal elements.  Finite element analysis will be validated from in vivo species and used to predict strain in those species or structures that are not amenable to in vivo techniques.  Cartilage performance, behavior, and morphology will be analyzed phylogenetically to uncover ecological and evolutionary patterns.  A research fellow, two graduate students and at least seven undergraduate students will receive research training in all aspects of the study, from data collection to publication.

Prochlorococcus is the single most abundant phytoplankton species in the global oceans and is responsible for producing an estimated 4 billion tons of fixed carbon each year, which is approximately the same productivity as global croplands. In addition they are the smallest and most efficient photosynthesizers designed by nature, relying only on sunlight, CO2 and essential nutrients for growth. For the past 25 years, research on this minimal prototroph has led to a growing understanding of its features across all scales of biological organization, from the genome to the global ecosystem. This fascinating microbe has also offered a great opportunity to foster public interest on topics such as ocean ecology, biodiversity and genomics. It attracts the attention of science journalists, and serves as an ""ambassador"" for microorganisms - exemplifying their important role in planetary maintenance. The one thing that is missing from the Prochlorococcus model system tool kit is the ability to do genetics. This bacterium has resisted all genetic manipulation attempts to date, which has significantly hampered the rate of discovery. The goal of this project is to directly address this limitation by developing an efficient genetic system for Prochlorococcus using both traditional and state-of-the-art tools developed specifically for this project.<br/><br/>Research on Prochlorococcus has expanded steadily over the past 25 years, as more and more strains have been brought into culture, and their distribution in the global oceans has been mapped extensively. The PIs now have 100s of Prochlorococcus cultures in the lab, an extensive amount of transcriptomics and proteomics data, and they continue to accumulate genomic data from cultures and wild populations. However each new Prochlorococcus strain, or single cell sequenced, adds roughly 100 entirely new genes to the Prochlorococcus pangenome, the vast majority of which are of unknown function. The development of a genetic system is necessary for identifying the functions of these unknown genes and testing hypotheses involving those with putative functions. This project notably involves a high throughput microfluidic electroporation technology to transform recalcitrant microbes orders of magnitude faster than traditional approaches. A global mutagenesis (Transposon-based tools) and targeted mutagenesis (CRISPR-based tools) strategy will be implemented for Prochlorococcus, while optimizing the microfluidic electroporation technology to its full potential. As proof-of-concept, each tool will be tested in its ability to efficiently reveal gene functions by using our current known repertoire of nutrient acquisition genes in Prochlorococcus."

Mites, in particular, due to their small size and wide distribution are poorly known and likely to harbor many new species. This research focuses on documenting the diversity and evolutionary relationships among velvet mites, chiggers, and water mites (Parasitengona). These particular mites are often the most abundant animals in a given habitat and can be useful indicators of ecosystem health in streams and forests. They have interesting life cycles, with parasitic larvae and predacious nymphs and adults. The larvae of most species are parasites of other arthropods and have been shown to affect host populations by shortening host life and reproductive capability. The larvae of one group - chiggers - are parasites of vertebrates and occasionally bite humans, causing irritation and public health concerns. The predatory nymphs and adults play important ecological roles as well, but they are also the most familiar, with some species being the largest and most colorful of all mites. This project will contribute to mite biology, but also has an extensive citizen science component that will engage the public and allow them to contribute to the knowledge of mites living in their area. Additionally, the project will work with K-12 educators to develop projects focused on the diversity of insects, scorpions, crabs, mites, and related animals (Arthropods) that will introduce students to the scientific method and improve observational skills and critical thinking.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to integrate modern morphological and phylogenomic tools to develop a complete evolutionary picture of the largest radiation of mites, Parasitengona (velvet mites, water mites, and chiggers). The project will address this goal with two specific aims that will bridge the gaps in Parasitengona systematics and target key elements meant to reach broader audiences. The first aim is to create a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for Parasitengona using an anchored hybrid enrichment protocol to sequence approximately 1000 loci across 600 taxa. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis will solidify the currently unstable classification and present a tool for testing many evolutionary questions, including two core events that have had the greatest impact on Parasitengona diversification: 1) the shift from predator to protelean parasite and subsequent host shifts; and 2) the invasion of freshwater. The second aim is to reconcile previous research on parasitengone morphology with modern approaches. An internal morphological survey will use modern non-destructive 3D imaging techniques such as confocal scanning microscopy to yield digital interactive models. An extensive external morphological survey using low-temperature scanning electron microscopy to gain unprecedented amounts of morphological information. Lastly, the project will integrate these new findings with legacy data into a matrix-format that will assist with understanding the evolution of the group and will be the first step to developing an online anatomy ontology for all mites. Overall, the project will produce an unparalleled amount of data for mites and develop a foundation for a multitude future research directions."

Although predictions vary, it is likely that the future will bring alterations to current weather patterns, with impacts on temperature and precipitation in particular. Research is needed to understand how these changes will affect agricultural productivity and to investigate whether the geographical ranges of crops and native plants will shift. This project uses genetic and genomic approaches to discover how the long-lived grass switchgrass and its relatives are able to respond and adapt naturally to environmental stresses in a range of diverse habitats.  A major focus of the research is to identify genes involved in local adaptation and drought tolerance across a latitudinal gradient in the US. Ultimately, this information will provide a basis for understanding how plants adapt to varying conditions and will provide tools to engineer stress resistance crops. Undergraduate students will be engaged in the project and will gain hands-on research experiences that span disciplinary and continental boundaries.<br/><br/>Although there is compelling evidence for local adaptation in plants, the genetic basis underlying these adaptations is not fully understood. In particular, it is unclear how genetic trade-offs at individual loci underlie the overall pattern of adaptation or the spatial scale of those effects. Moreover, the role of epigenetic ""memory"" of stress in perennial plants and their long term adaptation is largely unexplored. The integrative research in this project investigates local adaptation and acclimation in Panicum grasses. The specific objectives are to (1) conduct field QTL experiments to test for divergence, local adaptation, and genotype-by-environment interaction in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes, (2) fine-map and clone drought tolerance QTL in diploid Panicum hallii, (3) investigate the ecological and molecular drivers of drought legacy effects, and (4) conduct genome scans of climate adaptation in Panicum hallii. Another major goal is to train the next generation of plant scientists through an REU-type program that engages Freshman undergraduate students in research at the start of their education. The findings from this project will facilitate ongoing efforts to engineer crops for higher performance under drought conditions, one of the major limitations in agricultural productivity.

This is timely because as datasets become larger they demand new analytical approaches for yielding new knowledge. Quantitative genetics and genomics refer to the fields of science that combines concepts of genetics with computational and statistical tools to study the evolution and function of complex traits (e.g., clutch size in birds), medicine (e.g., cardiovascular disease), and agriculture (e.g., yield of corn). The genetics underlying complex traits was, until recently, very poorly known. Over the last decade there has been a revolution in research on quantitative traits due to availability of genomic and computational technologies. However, extracting knowledge from such data is challenging and this conference will discuss the latest research and technological advances. The outcomes from the conference will be an exchange of knowledge between the various uses of these technologies to a variety of biological questions. In the longer term, there will be benefits to medicine and to agriculture such as new drugs and information to support personalized medicine and new varieties of crop. <br/><br/>Genome wide association studies have discovered many loci that affect important traits in a wide variety of species, contributing to the understanding of these traits. Despite the success in mapping risk loci for many traits, the number of causal mutations that have been identified is low. To overcome this problem experiments using a range of omic technologies are underway. These include use of RNA sequencing to study the genetics of gene expression and functional annotation of genomic sites, e.g. using ChipSeq. While there are many conferences that cover parts of the same agenda as this GRC, this is probably the only conference that brings together those working in complex trait genetics from agriculture, medicine, and evolution in order to exchange techniques, approaches, and technologies. The GRCs are also unusual in the large amount of time set aside for discussion and the opportunities for informal discussion. This leads to cross fertilization of ideas and new collaborations. An associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will take place over the course of two-days leading up to the start of the conference for young scientists and investigators. In the GRS there is also a strong mentoring component where senior scientists attending the GRC are invited to the GRS for a mentoring lunch as well as a panel discussion with graduate students and post-docs attending the GRS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to identify characteristics and physiological strategies that lead to successful coral reproduction and long-term recovery despite bleaching.  This information can be applied to coral conservation and management efforts.  Furthermore, these findings will be incorporated into community outreach activities, as follows: in Hawaii, to develop a workshop with elementary teachers from Hawaiian immersion schools; in Washington, with Seattle MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement for underrepresented minorities, women, at-risk and economically disadvantaged youth) to connect science fundamentals to the real world and work with teachers to develop marine biology lesson plans; and in Pennsylvania, with the School District of Philadelphia to develop hands-on classroom activities and lead field trips to the local ocean with underserved high schools populated by over 90% minority students.<br/><br/>Most prior coral bleaching studies have focused on the potential of adult colonies to recover and acclimatize from stress. However, future reefs will not only require the survival of adults, but will also be dependent upon the continuation of sexual reproduction despite thermal stress. Little is known about the mechanisms corals use to tolerate and successfully reproduce in stressful environments. This interdisciplinary study will characterize the physiological and phenotypic responses associated with thermal stress and quantify the impacts of coral nutrition to reproduction.  The research will focus on an important and dominant reef builder in Hawaii that has the capacity to sexually reproduce despite bleaching. The objectives are to: (1) independently track the contribution of carbon and nitrogen acquired from parental photosynthesis and heterotrophy to gamete development in bleached and unbleached colonies; (2) develop nutritional proteome profiles of bleached and unbleached parental colonies and their eggs that have relied on different trophic sources throughout gamete development; and (3) use the proteomic surveys to develop a biomarker assay for coral trophic status. The findings of this study will detect biomarkers that can serve to monitor trophic status and identify coral species that are likely to recover and reproduce after a bleaching event. Altogether these data can be applied to conservation and management efforts and the development of accurate forecasting models."

The project will also provide unique opportunities for undergraduate students to learn advanced methods for investigating how specific proteins regulate nerve cell growth. Students will conduct experiments in Manduca to test the role of Ephrin and RACK1 in this process, and to identify other proteins that are required for Ephrin function. The data and resources produced by this project will be presented at major scientific conferences, published in scientific journals, and be posted on web sites that are freely available to other scientists and to the public. In addition, discoveries from this project will be presented to more general audiences at the Oregon Health and Science University Brain Fair, an interactive educational opportunity that is held annually at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.<br/><br/>This project will investigate how type-A Ephrins (which are attached to cells by GPI lipid anchors) can regulate the activity of intracellular tyrosine kinases in the Src family, and how this signaling pathway controls the migratory behavior of developing neurons. Preliminary studies indicate that the adapter protein RACK1 (Receptor of Activated Protein Kinase C) functions as a molecular rheostat that restricts Src signaling until MsEphrin signaling is initiated. Studies will be carried out using a well-characterized assay of neuronal migration in cultured Manduca embryos. Targeted manipulations of gene expression will test whether RACK1 is essential for the activation of a specific Src kinase (Src42) by type-A Ephrins. Biochemical assays of Src activity and Src-RACK1 interactions will test whether RACK1 functions as both a regulator and substrate for Src42 in this process. Time-lapse imaging and quantitative assays of neuronal migration will be used to investigate how this signaling pathway affects specific aspects of neuronal behavior in the developing nervous system. Similar methods will test whether a toll family protein (Toll-7) functions as a novel co-receptor for type-A Ephrins in this pathway. These experiments will also permit the downstream effectors of type-A Ephrins to be identified in related projects that will be conducted by selected undergraduate participants."

The long-term health of reefs worldwide is being negatively impacted by increased seawater temperatures that have led to coral bleaching and widespread coral mortality, especially during the last three years.  The goal of this research is to identify characteristics and physiological strategies that lead to successful coral reproduction and long-term recovery despite bleaching.  This information can be applied to coral conservation and management efforts.  Furthermore, these findings will be incorporated into community outreach activities, as follows: in Hawaii, to develop a workshop with elementary teachers from Hawaiian immersion schools; in Washington, with Seattle MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement for underrepresented minorities, women, at-risk and economically disadvantaged youth) to connect science fundamentals to the real world and work with teachers to develop marine biology lesson plans; and in Pennsylvania, with the School District of Philadelphia to develop hands-on classroom activities and lead field trips to the local ocean with underserved high schools populated by over 90% minority students.<br/><br/>Most prior coral bleaching studies have focused on the potential of adult colonies to recover and acclimatize from stress. However, future reefs will not only require the survival of adults, but will also be dependent upon the continuation of sexual reproduction despite thermal stress. Little is known about the mechanisms corals use to tolerate and successfully reproduce in stressful environments. This interdisciplinary study will characterize the physiological and phenotypic responses associated with thermal stress and quantify the impacts of coral nutrition to reproduction.  The research will focus on an important and dominant reef builder in Hawaii that has the capacity to sexually reproduce despite bleaching. The objectives are to: (1) independently track the contribution of carbon and nitrogen acquired from parental photosynthesis and heterotrophy to gamete development in bleached and unbleached colonies; (2) develop nutritional proteome profiles of bleached and unbleached parental colonies and their eggs that have relied on different trophic sources throughout gamete development; and (3) use the proteomic surveys to develop a biomarker assay for coral trophic status. The findings of this study will detect biomarkers that can serve to monitor trophic status and identify coral species that are likely to recover and reproduce after a bleaching event. Altogether these data can be applied to conservation and management efforts and the development of accurate forecasting models."

Traditionally, group members have been thought of as identical individuals, but behavioral variation is prevalent in nature. This variation can be extreme and one group member, referred to here as the keystone individual, may have a greater impact on the collective behavior of a group than all other individuals. For example, some individuals may lead a group, tutor others or function as super-spreaders of information or disease. Despite the potential impact of keystone individuals on the success of a group, little is known about how and why this influence emerges. The investigators will use social spiders that can be easily manipulated and observed at the individual and group levels to test hypotheses about the emergence of collective behavior, hypotheses that cannot be easily evaluated in more complex systems. In addition to the numerous undergraduate and graduate research projects this project will generate, the proposed work will also be translated into hands-on activities about collective behavior geared towards the education of K-12 students though established and successful outreach programs. Adult science education activities to enhance public knowledge of invertebrate biology will include public lectures, media coverage, and conversations at local communities where the field work occurs.<br/> <br/>This research aims to examine the mechanisms by which keystone individuals affect collective behavior, the effects of keystones on the development of collective behaviors and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of keystone individuals in groups. Using a model system that allows for detailed experimental manipulations, the social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola), will allow the investigators to develop a broad theory to enhance the progress of science on keystone individuals. Specifically, this work will (1) test whether keystone individuals produce tradeoffs among colony-level processes such as prey capture and disease spread, and how these tradeoffs change colony performance in different environments; (2) uncover the temporal dynamics of the effects of keystone individuals on the development of collective behaviors in the field; (3) elucidate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie the catalytic effects of keystone individuals on the behavior of other group members and collective outcomes; and (4) design versatile agent-based models that will uncover the general  mechanisms by which keystone individuals influence collective behaviors. The investigators will address these questions by combining lab and field experiments, analyzed with sophisticated image analysis technology and social network theory, with computational modeling.

The long-standing success of birds may be attributable in part to their unique reproductive physiology, which includes a specialized skeletal tissue deposited in the inner cavity of long bones known as medullary bone (MB). MB acts as a calcium reserve for the production of eggshells and was long thought to be a key reproductive adaptation unique to birds. However, the tissue has recently been purported to occur in a handful of extinct species, including both non-avian dinosaurs and dinosaurian relatives. Given the vast evolutionary distance across the groups in which MB has been tentatively identified (across lineages that diverged over 100 million years prior to the origin of birds), substantiation (or refutation) of MB in these taxa and a careful study of the chemical characteristics and microstructure of these skeletal tissues is a critical first step to determine the validity of these identifications and the evolutionary significance of this tissue. The proposed project will be transformative in developing an untested, independent proxy for chemically distinguishing MB in fossils, and a non-destructive means for identifying the microstructure of MB in the fossil record that can be used to explore reproductive life history and physiology of the bird lineage in deep time. Public outreach and education associated with this research will be conducted at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. <br/><br/>Medullary bone (MB) is an ephemeral, estrogen dependent, endosteal tissue lining the marrow cavity in extant avialans (birds). This specialized reproductive tissue is highly vascular histologically, exhibits a woven bone matrix, and is more densely mineralized than other bone types. Although originally considered a key avian adaptation, MB has since been identified in non-avian theropod and ornithopod dinosaurs, far removed phylogenetically from the direct lineage of extant avialans, and most recently outside of Dinosauria, in one of the clade's closest extinct relatives Pterosauria (non-dinosaurian flying reptiles). To date, identifications of MB in fossils have relied exclusively on structural comparisons (location, texture, distribution, and microstructure) with MB in birds by means of histological (destructive) sampling. However, MB in living birds can also be identified by its unique molecular signature because the tissue incorporates more non-collagenous proteins than cortical bone, and utilizes more sulfated glycosaminoglycans, particularly keratan sulfate, which is not present in cortical bone. This project will provide new information on chemical and microstructural variation in MB within extant avialans and will use these data to generate novel µCT and histochemical techniques for identifying MB in the fossil record. This protocol will then be used to test the homology of published accounts of MB in extinct Archosauria, ultimately providing an informed phylogenetic context for the evolution of medullary bone and avian-specific reproductive physiology. This research is co-funded through the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering in support of research on fossils in China and Mongolia in this project."

Each time an organism makes this choice, it must also cope with the associated trade-offs that directly impact both its survival and reproductive fitness. Despite the critical importance of choosing between self-maintenance and reproduction, the mechanisms that shape these decision-making processes is not yet understood. In addition, it is not clear how resource availability, such as the quantity of body fat stores and the presence of mates and food, influences the motivation to pursue one opportunity over another. The goal of this project is to understand if and how glucocorticoid hormones interact with specific neuropeptides in the brain to regulate the behavioral switch between reproduction and feeding. This project provides outstanding opportunities for student involvement, with hands-on training in techniques that integrate neuroendocrine methods with behavioral analyses in the field. All project participants receive training in effective science communication techniques using a teaching module that includes participation in a community-based workshop on the ""Neurobiology of Decision-Making."" The proximate goal is to broaden the participation of diverse students in science education and community outreach. The researcher also incorporates project results into inquiry-based learning modules for use in the classroom, thereby exposing many more students to scientific discovery than is typically achievable in the laboratory. <br/><br/>This project merges field and laboratory studies to better understand the neuroendocrine basis of decision-making. Because the decision to pursue reproductive versus foraging opportunities occurs on a short time scale (minutes to hours) in many animals, it is often difficult to disentangle the mechanisms that regulate both the individual behaviors and the transition between them. In this context, organisms that exhibit seasonal transitions between temporally distinct life-history stages can illuminate the mechanisms that regulate the underlying behaviors in all animals. Red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) are a phenomenal vertebrate model in this regard because reproduction and foraging are relegated to temporally distinct life-history stages, and snakes undergo dramatic changes in hormone-brain-behavior relationships during the transition to foraging. Based on extensive preliminary data from the investigator's laboratory, this project tests a model in which glucocorticoids interact with the neuromodulators arginine vasotocin and neuropeptide Y to facilitate life-history transitions. The investigator uses a combination of pharmacological manipulation, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and behavioral assays to achieve the following aims: (1) Determine the function of elevated glucocorticoids during life-history transitions; (2) Determine how glucocorticoids interact with neuromodulators to induce life-history transitions; and (3) Determine if and how neuromodulators are associated with altered sensitivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Results from this project will provide a framework for understanding the neuroendocrine basis of decision-making and the mechanisms by which neuroendocrine signals reconfigure regulatory systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will be conducted using zebrafish larvae as a model system because they can be used to study the organization and function of fluorescently labeled proteins in living tissues. Data resulting from these studies are expected to provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying how muscle cells respond to stress. Such insights have implications for understanding or modifying the limits of muscle performance, engineering, adaptation and repair in a wide variety of organisms. In addition to the new information generated, the project will also benefit society by promoting teaching, training and learning, and by broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Outreach educational workshops with area high schools will be developed and strengthened through conducting hands-on research projects with zebrafish larvae. Student conceptual understanding will be assessed through the use of pre-and post-workshop evaluations. Opportunities will also be created for high school students to visit and work in laboratories of active investigators at Washington State University and the neighboring University of Idaho.

To accomplish this, the function of transcription factor HSF1 will be manipulated and effects on hypoxia inducible small heat shock protein expression analyzed. Mutagenesis of small heat shock protein promoters will also be conducted to identify motifs required for hypoxia-induced expression. Second, phosphorylation-dependent interaction kinetics of small heat shock proteins with the cytoskeleton will be analyzed in hypoxic muscle cells. Mutagenesis of serine/threonine residues will be conducted and effects on hypoxia inducible phosphorylation established. Dynamic interactions of wild-type and phosphorylation site mutant heat shock proteins with the cytoskeleton and each other will be examined in control and hypoxic muscles. Finally, small heat shock protein expression will be altered in muscles, and cytoarchitecture and function of muscle cells responding to hypoxia will be assessed. To accomplish this aim, zebrafish lines that over-, and under-express small heat shock proteins in skeletal muscle will be created.

Additionally, national surveys show that sleep is poorly understood among the general public and that many Americans, particularly students, are extremely sleep deprived.  Therefore, this project integrates a series of research and educational goals to impact our understanding of the brain mechanisms that control mammalian sleep.  The PI will manipulate two populations of neurons (called AgRP neurons and POMC neurons) in rodent brains using powerful genetic technologies to determine their roles in regulating sleep/wake behavior.  These groups of neurons are well-known for sensing the nutritional and caloric needs of the body, and so our research will study how food intake affects states of sleep and wakefulness. This work will thus increase our understanding of how the brain coordinates complex behavioral states, in this case hunger and sleep.  The educational goals will broaden the impact of this project by including undergraduates in all aspects of this research and by implementing a new course at Williams College on the science of sleep.  This course will produce educational materials on sleep that will be freely available and distributed. Together, the research and educational components of this award will increase the United States' competitiveness in science and technology, particularly in the field of neuroscience.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how neurons that regulate energy homeostasis also regulate sleep.  Previous studies indicate that sleep/wake states are significantly affected by food need and availability, but the role of neurons that regulate food intake in sleep/wake behavior is unknown.  The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus contains two populations of neurons that regulate food intake behavior: orexigenic agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons.  Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that AgRP neurons can independently promote wakefulness and food intake and that POMC neurons maintain sleep states in addition to suppressing appetite.  Previous data also suggest that AgRP and POMC neurons might influence sleep/wake states by projecting to hypocretin-expressing neurons and melanin-concentrating hormone-expressing neurons, respectively, in the lateral hypothalamus.  This project will use cutting-edge optogenetic and chemogenetic methods in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral analyses to increase our understanding of these systems in sleep/wake behavior and thus how the brain coordinates complex behavioral states.

It is far less clear how these processes operate in females, despite emerging evidence that female competition is widespread and beneficial in the animal kingdom. This research will identify whether and how social competition ""primes"" (or adaptively prepares) females for future competition. The subject is a cavity-nesting female songbird, the tree swallow, for which social challenges from rivals pose a very real threat to survival and reproduction. Using experimental manipulations that generate competition in the wild, this research will investigate how social competition alters female aggression, maternal care, and immune function, including tools and approaches that connect multiple levels of biological organization, from gene expression, to behavior and physiology, to reproductive fitness. Research on female aggression is an excellent platform for outreach to women and girls in science, and this will be highlighted in hands-on modules for several community organizations near Indiana University's campus, with an emphasis on the plight of cavity nesting birds and the effects of habitat loss on their behavior. The development of an interactive data-logging nestbox features prominently in these efforts. This project will also provide unique training for undergraduates in animal behavior, including field, lab, and programming skills, public speaking, ethics, and critical thinking. The primary avenue for training is a summer undergraduate research program that targets groups underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to determine how social challenges prepare females for future social instability, particularly how brain and periphery are coordinated in their phenotypic and transcriptomic responses. The working hypotheses are that social challenges prime females for success in future competition, favoring greater aggression at the expense of parenting and self-maintenance, and that these effects are coordinated by tissue-level changes in specific G protein-coupled receptor signaling systems that are not as costly to females as the male-typical social modulation of testosterone. Using experimental manipulations that generate true social instability in the wild, this research will (1) quantify how social instability alters aggression and maternal care, (2) quantify how the social environment affects inflammatory function, as an integrated measure of immune system readiness that may be relevant during competition, and (3) identify and experimentally perturb socially sensitive gene networks in neural and peripheral tissues, including one tissue that can be re-sampled without euthanasia (blood). This research is therefore an essential step in organismal biology's goal of predicting responses to diverse environmental challenges, and it will advance the development of broadly applicable models of behavioral plasticity that integrate function with mechanism. A whole-organism approach will allow new perspectives on phenotypic and genomic flexibility, where insights to be gained by joint consideration of brain and periphery have yet to be fully realized. These studies offer an extraordinary opportunity for substantive advances in understanding the mechanisms, phenotypic consequences, and adaptive significance of organismal responses to ecologically relevant behavioral challenges."

Conflicts arise whenever the interests of interacting individuals are not wholly aligned, yet many social interactions require individuals to reach some compromise. Parental care is an interaction that is rife with conflict, because both parents benefit from shifting the burden of care to the other, yet requires cooperation, because both parents benefit from the total amount of care. The outcome of conflict between parents has been modeled using economic game theory models, which assume that individuals act in their best interest but that their optimal behavior depends on how others behave. This project will build on existing empirical and theoretical work to test alternative hypotheses for how parents negotiate care utilizing a tractable study system: the clown anemonefish a.k.a. Nemo. Studying how conflict among caring parents is resolved is critical to understanding why animals, including humans, form such alliances. Undergraduates involved in the project   will receive training in aquarium maintenance, assist in ongoing research, and complete independent research projects. This project will also encourage participation of underrepresented groups in science through the researchers' participation in Science Club for Girls and through work with local school groups at the Mahonia Na Dari field station. The results will be broadly disseminated through presentations at international scientific meetings and development of ""data nuggets"" (http://datanuggets.org/) to ensure that results are available in a format that will enhance public understanding.<br/><br/>The existence of biparental care poses a perplexing evolutionary question because parents must coordinate their behavior to raise offspring when there are costs to providing care and inherent conflicts of interest among parents. The objective of this project is to test plausible alternative hypotheses for the factors that govern how parents negotiate the amount of care to provide to their offspring, and create a more general framework for understanding conflict resolution. The researchers will test four alternative hypotheses for how parents negotiate the amount of care to provide to their offspring: H0) Parental effort is fixed; H1) Parental effort is negotiated based on partner effort alone; H2) Parental effort is negotiated with an information asymmetry; H3) Parental effort is negotiated with a power asymmetry; H4) Parental effort is negotiated with a simple form of reciprocity. Experiments will be conducted in a natural population of clown anemonefish (Amphiprion percula) in Papua New Guinea. By supplementing food resources, effort by each parent will be manipulated in a non-invasive and ecologically relevant manner.  The anemonefish system allows tests of alternative hypotheses simultaneously, where previous studies have only tested them in isolation. Furthermore, the majority of negotiation studies have been conducted in birds, so utilizing A. percula will test the generality of theoretical predictions. In sum, the proposed research will use a tractable study species together with a rigorous alternative hypothesis testing approach to determine the factors that influence the outcome of negotiations. While incorporating teaching, training and learning, this research will create a more general framework for studying conflict resolution and revise our understanding of negotiations over offspring care."

On one hand, the red coloration may be assessed by potential partners during mate-choice, where individuals with the brightest red color are more likely to be chosen as a mate. Evidence supports this idea in animals such as birds and fish. On the other hand, some research has found that red color may have a physiological function, for example, acting as a sunscreen that offers protection from potentially damaging solar radiation. This project uses copepods, tiny shrimp-like animals with bright red colors, to test whether to examine if red copepod color is (1) a signal of mate quality, (2) a sunscreen, or (3) both a signal of quality and a sunscreen. The results of this research will advance the basic understanding of animal coloration in group of animals that has not been well studied. In addition, the researchers will use this study system to bring science training to Alabama children in fourth through sixth grade. Working through a well-structured program--Getting Under The Surface (GUTS)--teams of parents and children from some of the most science-deficient school systems in the U.S. will be invited to half-day programs run by faculty. Two programs will be run involving the same student/parent teams.

The project focuses on physiological constraints on the production of red carotenoids in animals, using Tigriopus copepods as a model. The researchers use diet manipulations to vary carotenoid coloration and to test whether red colors in copepods are used as a visual signal in male and female mate choice, or whether red coloration acts as a protectant against UV radiation.

Today, oxidative stress arising from ozone exposure is reducing potential maize yields by up to 10%, which in 2011 would have been valued at $7646 million. This project couples the unique capabilities of Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) technology, which provides controlled elevation of ozone in open-air at field scale, with the power of the vast genetic resources in maize and transcriptome profiling.  It will provide a foundation for crop improvement by quantifying genetic variation in response to elevated ozone among 200 inbred and 100 hybrid maize lines in the field.  The project will use high-throughput phenotyping of ozone impacts on maize growth, senescence, leaf metabolism and reproductive processes to identify traits that correlate with yield loss.  It will identify the genes and gene networks underpinning the ozone response in the most extreme tolerant and susceptible lines, and their hybrids, by integrating transcriptome analysis and detailed physiological analysis in inbred and hybrid maize.  The project will develop or select existing biparental populations derived from tolerant and sensitive parents to identify QTL and eQTL for ozone tolerance.  Finally, the project will assess crosstalk between ozone and biotic stress response gene networks in maize.  <br/><br/>This work will address key mechanistic hypotheses about how oxidative stress leads to transcriptional reprogramming of antioxidant and carbon metabolism, as well as hormone, senescence and defense pathways. This multifaceted approach is essential because multiple physiological drivers of yield are sensitive to oxidative stress from ozone exposure.  Consequently, oxidative stress tolerance is undoubtedly a complex, polygenic trait.  The broad application of quantitative genetic tools coupled to gene expression profiling and biochemical and physiological analyses of diverse germplasm makes the challenge of discovering the foundation for ozone tolerance tractable for the first time.  With regard to outreach and training, this Mid-Career Investigator Award in Plant Genome Research (MCA-PGR) will help re-tool two mid-career plant physiologists who study plant physiological and agronomic responses to environmental change with training in genomics and quantitative genetics.   This new expertise will allow them and their post-docs and graduate students to address major challenges in agriculture and ecology by leveraging the full power of genomics through bioinformatics, quantitative genetics and expression profiling using next-generation sequencing technologies.  In addition, the project will provide outreach through an after-school program on plant biology at a local middle school and a summer science camp for high school girls. Pollen images and pollen viability data, sequencing and proteomics datasets developed in this project will be publicly available at public repositories such as the iPlant Collaborative, NCBI GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and EMBL-EBI PRIDE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/).

Likewise, when plants are stressed from temperature, RNAs in cells are thermodynamically affected.  Taken together, these observations suggest that drought and temperature regulate RNA folding, and that RNA structure may play a central role in regulating gene expression and stress tolerance in rice. To evaluate the contribution of RNA structural changes to the regulation of gene expression in rice, this project will leverage, advance and apply recently developed in vivo and computational tools to reveal, on a genome-wide basis, how RNA folds in vivo in rice during drought and temperature stress."

During this time a wide range of environmental conditions occurred, including mass extinctions, and yet these plants survived. An intriguing question is how the living fossils were able to persist over millions of years and further, how their extant relatives diverged and evolved. Belonging to the cone-bearing, non-flowering group of plants, called gymnosperms, these species with huge and complex genomes could hold clues to understanding genomic resilience to environmental change. Advances in sequencing technologies are now available to answer these questions.  Very recently, approaches have become available to characterize these complex organisms genetically at a reasonable cost. This interdisciplinary team of researchers compare ancient and more highly evolved relatives to identify how genomes function, adapt and evolve. The project is dedicated to training the next generation of scientists and brings analytical and critical thinking skills to the general public through outreach activities. <br/> <br/>Three of the four extant gymnosperm lineages contain species which Darwin termed ""living fossils."" These have been present since the Devonian Era and have survived an incredible range of environmental conditions. The genomes of almost all the gymnosperms are extremely large and complex and have been somewhat refractive to genomic characterization as a result.  However, the development of the Oxford Nanopore PromethION sequencer, which can provide extremely long reads (greater than 10 kb) at a reasonable cost, will be used to carry out detailed characterization of the genomes of these plants as well as their more modern, radiated lineages. In addition, the methylation status of these species will be analyzed from multiple tissues to understand epigenomic variability. Specific questions about genome resilience and evolutionary relationships will be addressed. Advances in single molecule sequencing technologies from this project will have broad impact across the life sciences. Educational and outreach programs are designed to improve public understanding or science through engagement with the New York Botanical Garden, and project personnel will contribute expertise to developing exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History.

Traditionally, group members have been thought of as identical individuals, but behavioral variation is prevalent in nature. This variation can be extreme and one group member, referred to here as the keystone individual, may have a greater impact on the collective behavior of a group than all other individuals. For example, some individuals may lead a group, tutor others or function as super-spreaders of information or disease. Despite the potential impact of keystone individuals on the success of a group, little is known about how and why this influence emerges. The investigators will use social spiders that can be easily manipulated and observed at the individual and group levels to test hypotheses about the emergence of collective behavior, hypotheses that cannot be easily evaluated in more complex systems. In addition to the numerous undergraduate and graduate research projects this project will generate, the proposed work will also be translated into hands-on activities about collective behavior geared towards the education of K-12 students though established and successful outreach programs. Adult science education activities to enhance public knowledge of invertebrate biology will include public lectures, media coverage, and conversations at local communities where the field work occurs.<br/> <br/>This research aims to examine the mechanisms by which keystone individuals affect collective behavior, the effects of keystones on the development of collective behaviors and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of keystone individuals in groups. Using a model system that allows for detailed experimental manipulations, the social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola), will allow the investigators to develop a broad theory to enhance the progress of science on keystone individuals. Specifically, this work will (1) test whether keystone individuals produce tradeoffs among colony-level processes such as prey capture and disease spread, and how these tradeoffs change colony performance in different environments; (2) uncover the temporal dynamics of the effects of keystone individuals on the development of collective behaviors in the field; (3) elucidate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie the catalytic effects of keystone individuals on the behavior of other group members and collective outcomes; and (4) design versatile agent-based models that will uncover the general  mechanisms by which keystone individuals influence collective behaviors. The investigators will address these questions by combining lab and field experiments, analyzed with sophisticated image analysis technology and social network theory, with computational modeling.  Published data sets will be uploaded for use by others to Dryad."

A pivotal step in the evolution of life was the transition from being unicellular to becoming multicellular.  The closest protozoan relatives of animals are aquatic ""choanoflagellates"", which are unicellular but can also form multicellular colonies.   For multicellularity to evolve, colonies of animal ancestors must have performed functions affecting their survival better than did solitary cells.  This study examines whether unicellular or multicellular choanoflagellates are better able to avoid being eaten by protozoan predators, and the mechanisms involved.  This project at the interface between biology and physics (hydrodynamics of how aquatic predators and prey interact) will give teams of undergraduate students from different majors hands-on research experience and will involve them in interdisciplinary research, which is important because many future discoveries in science and technology will be made at interfaces between different fields. Public outreach includes an interactive online site where citizen scientists can calculate the predation rates on unicellular and multicellular choanoflagellates by different types of predators. Work with women and dyslexics by the PIs will encourage success in science and technology fields. A novel microfluidic system will be developed to determine how performance and mechanisms of predator-prey interactions (usually studied in still water) are affected by realistic patterns of fluctuating shear that microscopic swimmers experience in natural, turbulent water flow.  This system will be useful for studying other aquatic microoganisms interacting with each other in nature.<br/> <br/>Protozoans, both unicellular and colonial, play important roles in aquatic food webs.  Chonaoflagellates, the closest protozoan relatives of animals, will be used to study mechanisms underlying resistance to predation by uni- vs. multicellular protozoans.  Data about choanoflagellates will also enable informed inferences about the possible role of predation as a selective factor in the evolution of multicellularity.  The origin of multicellular animals from unicellular protozoans represents a pivotal transition in life's history.  This study focuses on resistance to being eaten by protozoan predators (before animals evolved, predators on chonaoflagellates were other protozoans).   Research goals are to:  1) quantify performance differences between unicellular and colonial choanoflagellates in avoiding predation by protozoan predators using different modes of prey capture;  2) elucidate fluid dynamics of interactions between predators and choanoflagellate prey to identify mechanisms underlying performance differences;  3) determine how fluctuating shear encountered by protozoans carried in turbulent water flow in nature affects interactions of unicellular vs. colonial prey with predators.  High-speed videomicrography of predators, prey, and flow-marking microbeads will record interactions of choanoflagellates with different protozoan predators. Digitized protozoan trajectories enable calculation of encounter and predation success rates, and behavioral interactions. Particle tracking velocimetry will quantify instantaneous flow fields produced by predators and prey, and hydrodynamic signals during their interactions.  A novel contribution is development of microfluidic techniques to determine how mechanisms of predator-prey interactions (usually studied in still water) are affected by realistic patterns of fluctuating shear that microscopic swimmers experience in turbulent ambient water flow."

This phenomenon has been termed ""priming"". This project explores the molecular patterns of response indicative of priming using both field observations and controlled environment experiments. Since ecological theory predicts that there should be a cost to priming, measurements of the effects of priming on plant growth, reproduction and rates of herbivory will be used to determine both the costs and benefits of priming. Finally, the progeny of primed and non-primed plants will be examined to determine if the offspring of primed plants are better defended than offspring from non-primed plants. This project will continue the ""Million Leaf Project"", which is a science workshop developed by the lead investigator to introduce citizens and grade school students to plant-insect interactions by teaching an experiential approach to both measure and analyze the damage experienced by plants and their leaves. Participants collect their own data to explore how much pressure insect consumers put on plants, and therefore how plant chemical defenses and sensory perception might have evolved. The results of this research may also be applied to inducing greater resistance to herbivory in agricultural crops, thereby reducing losses to pests.<br/><br/>The principle objective of this study is to test fitness costs and molecular patterns associated with defense priming under controlled and field conditions in two phylogenetically disparate Rosids: Arabidopsis thaliana and Phaseolus lunatus.  Overwhelming evidence exists that plants respond to certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from their neighbors or distal parts of themselves by ""priming"" (i.e., preparing) their defenses. However, the volatile-associated molecular patterns (VAMPs) indicative of priming are not well known. Moreover, ecological theory predicts that induced processes should incur fitness costs, but there is currently limited evidence to support this prediction with respect to HIPV-mediated priming. The project will test the hypothesis that plants responding to HIPVs will incur measurable fitness costs that will be less severe than costs of induced resistance, and that HIPV-primed plants will produce offspring with altered physiology indicative of priming (i.e., they will be ""Primed to be Primed""). This project will address a key gap in our understanding of defense priming. The project includes post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate training. Undergraduates will be required from a diverse population of historically underrepresented groups at the University of Louisville.  Citizen science outreach is included through the ""Million Leaf Project"" where participants learn to quantify herbivore damage to leaves and develop their own hypotheses related to the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions."

While the genome sequences provide the ""parts lists"" for tens of thousands of protein-coding genes in each species, the vast majority of genes in most plant species remain to be functionally annotated, which has become a major bottleneck for the whole plant biology field. A prerequisite for any effort to determine the functions of proteins on a genome-wide scale requires the construction of a set or library of bacterial clones with inserts representing only the protein coding regions or open reading frames (ORFs) of genes.  These libraries are often referred to as an ORFeome.  A significant hurdle for constructing an ORFeome library is that tens of thousands of clones must be sequenced individually, making the process extremely labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive since next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies cannot be applied directly. This EAGER project aims to develop a massively parallel sequencing technology, called PLATE-seq (PCR mediated linkage of barcoded adapters to nucleic acid elements for sequencing), which will drastically increase the throughput and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing efforts. As part of the proof-of-concept and to demonstrate the utility of PLATE-seq, the project will construct the first fully-sequenced single-colony rice (Oryza sativa, cv. Nipponbare) ORFeome library for ~3,000 genes. This EAGER project is interdisciplinary in nature and represents a mid-career reorientation of research interest into the field of plant science for the Principal Investigator, and will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors. All protocols will be accessible through publications, seminars, and training workshops. In addition, all ORF clones, E. coli and yeast strains, computational tools, and sequence data generated in association with this project will be made openly available.<br/><br/>Next-generation sequencing technologies require mixing tens of thousands of samples together to be sequenced en masse. Multiplexing strategies offer a partial solution to the need to track individual samples, but can be prohibitively expensive when sequences need to be matched to thousands of individual samples, which is the case for constructing an ORFeome library. For this reason, large-scale Sanger sequencing, albeit extremely expensive, is still necessary for many such applications. The PLATE-seq platform is based on an innovative but unproven design which requires large-scale nested stitch PCRs from thousands of E. coli or yeast colonies where the use of ~150 bp double-stranded DNA as a primer in one of the steps can significantly decrease the PCR efficiency. If successful, PLATE-seq technology will completely replace the need for large-scale Sanger sequencing, predicted to improve sequencing efficiency of ORFeome libraries ~1,000-fold over existing multiplexing NGS approaches, and even more so compared to traditional Sanger sequencing. For this reason, PLATE-seq has tremendous implications not only for constructing ORFeome libraries, but also for many functional genomics and reverse proteomics applications where it is essential that sequencing reads be traced back to individual samples, or where associations between samples need to be tracked such as in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) or other genetic screens where pairs of DNA molecules are selected and identified."

This plasticity is thought to allow evolution to occur faster because it allows a species to have multiple traits.  We don't yet know of many genes that allow some creatures to have this plasticity.  This project will study a set of genes that create plasticity in the nematode worm Pristionchus pacificus.  This worm has different mouth structures and behaviors depending on crowding and availability of food.  The research will determine the function of these genes and how they interact, and it will reconstruct how these genes have evolved in related species that don't have developmental plasticity.  The results of the research will show how developmental plasticity operates and changes at the level of individual genes.  In addition, the investigators will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in biological research spanning the fields of genetics, developmental biology, and evolution.  The research will augment two successful science outreach programs established at Indiana University: a) the PI will host and mentor underrepresented minority high-school students in their own research project, collect data, and present findings at an annual poster conference; b), the PI will help high-school teachers to develop and implement projects, experiments, and activities as classroom resources to improve the teaching and learning of state life science standards.<br/><br/>This project will build a functional genetic understanding of how development responds to diverse environmental settings, specifically through the production of discrete, alternative phenotypes (i.e., polyphenism).  The objectives of the research are twofold. First, it will characterize the genetic factors and pathway that constitute a developmental switch for a polyphenism in the model nematode Pristionchus pacificus, by means of: (i) cloning and determining the spatial expression of genes that act downstream of a known polyphenism switch gene (eud-1), and; (ii) empirically determining how the interactions between their products form an environmentally responsive switch.  Second, the research will determine how these factors change or assume new functions with the divergence of polyphenism regulation.  Specifically, the research will reconstruct the evolutionary history of these factors via: (i) inferring patterns of sequence evolution and identifying potential functional variants, and; (ii) using reverse genetics in other species to perform comparative functional tests of those factors. Through analysis of a genetic pathway forming a developmental switch and the evolutionary divergence of its components, this research project will pioneer a functional genetic analysis of how developmental plasticity - specifically, a polyphenism - responds to environmental inputs, and how its regulation changes over evolutionary time."

This meeting promotes the advancement of science by tackling an understudied dimension of plant systems - time. To survive, plants must adapt to an ever-changing environment in real-time, often maintaining those responses over a prolonged time, yet current studies typically capture only a snapshot of a response. This conference will highlight new methods and approaches to track and analyze dynamic plant responses in real time, at different time-scales and at different levels of inquiry. It brings together world experts in this emerging field, from a variety of disciplines that include cell biology, development, physiology, genomics, environmental biology and evolutionary biology, and puts them in a small setting with young scientists to nucleate a new subdiscipline of plant biology, Dynamic Plant Systems. Understanding these dynamics has practical implications for national health, prosperity and welfare, and talks will address how new approaches are able to capture real-time plant responses that have economic importance. One example is a system developed to allow real-time tracking of complex changes in root architecture, gene expression, and microbial associations that both model and crop plant species have to changes in their environment. Another example captures how the coordinate actions of light-signaling pathways and the circadian clock enhance plant performance in natural environments. The scientifically diverse slate of speakers is also diverse ethnically and with respect to gender, and the organizers will have an outreach consultant focusing on social media and underrepresented demographics to broaden participation in this exciting new area.<br/><br/>As dynamics affects all parts of plant biology, the meeting will keep a breadth across topics in plant biology, but with a unique focus on time across scales of inquiry. These span a keynote which presents advances in genomics, epigenomics and proteomics, coupled to novel modeling and statistical approaches, including time-based studies that beginning to reveal previously unknown gene-network interactions at a variety of levels that could not be identified using more conventional means. Other time- based studies will reveal new experimental methods to capture these cellular network connections in 3D at high resolution, as well as methods to analyze and visualize these cell-cell networks over time. In addition, presentations will introduce how light sheet microscopy has uncovered a time-based, clock-like process responsible for the positioning of lateral roots along the root primary axis. An important part of attracting scientists to a new field of study is supporting career development, and the meeting will include several activities including a Power Hour intended to support the professional growth of young scientists, especially women in our scientific communities and provide an open forum for discussion and mentoring. An associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will take place over the course of two-days leading up to the start of the conference. The GRS is a unique forum for graduate students, post- docs to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. One discussion section will focus on the transition from graduate and post-doc studies to further careers in science, hosted by an early career Assistant Professor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite four decades of research, critical aspects of the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation process remain obscure. One of the most intriguing, yet least understood, aspects is how the bacterium utilizes its protein effectors, which it transfers with the Transferred (T-)-DNA, into the host cell, to ""colonize"" the host genome; prepare it for T-DNA invasion at additional integration sites, recruit bacterial and host DNA repair machinery, and repress host defenses to assure optimal expression of the T-DNA. This project aims to provide these missing pieces of information by investigating functional interactions between Agrobacterium effector proteins and their host cell partners. The broader importance of the resulting data lies in the enhancement of our basic understanding of plant-bacterium interactions and Agrobacterium pathogenicity, translation of the developed models to a broader range of bacterium-host interactions, and in providing a scientific foundation for the design of safer and more efficient genetic transformation procedures that benefit science, agriculture and the society. This research will serve as a platform for teaching undergraduate and community college science and introducing young scientists into the fields of experimental plant microbiology and biology.<br/><br/>Agrobacterium has been considered a unique prokaryote that encodes a protein machinery for DNA transfer and integration into eukaryotic genomes. This dogma is challenged by recent discoveries that other diverse bacterial species, also encode functional DNA transfer machineries. Enhancing fundamental knowledge about genetic transformation with Agrobacterium, therefore, will advance understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and improve Agrobacterium as a gene transfer tool for agriculture, but also will inform translation to a broad range of eukaryotic host-prokaryotic pathogen interactions. This project's goals are to understand how Agrobacterium creates double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), which are used as preferred integration sites, how the T-DNA molecule and the appropriate cellular DNA repair factors are recruited to DSBs, and how Agrobacterium overcomes host defenses that can silence T-DNA expression. Aim 1 examines the mechanism by which Agrobacterium enriches DSBs in the plant genomic DNA. A hypothesis will be tested that a bacterial virulence (Vir) effector protein (e.g., VirE3) interacts with a host S1-type endonuclease to initiate generation of DSBs.  Aim 2 examines the mechanism by which Agrobacterium targets the T-DNA to the DSB and recruits the host DNA polymerase to integrate the T-DNA and repair the DSB. A hypothesis will be tested that a bacterial Vir effector associated with the T-DNA (e.g., VirE2) interacts with a host DSB-bound factor (e.g., a BRCA-like protein) to direct the T-DNA to DSB, and another T-DNA-associated Vir effector (e.g., VirD2) recruits a host DNA polymerase (e.g., Pol theta) to the same DSB. Aim 3 will examine how Agrobacterium suppresses the host defensive RNA silencing to facilitate expression of T-DNA. A hypothesis will be tested that Agrobacterium utilizes one of its F-box protein effectors to target the components of the host RNA silencing machinery to proteasomal degradation via the SCF pathway.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wessler (University of Georgia - Athens) <br/><br/>The origin and early diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) had profound impacts on Earth's biota, providing the raw genetic material from which most crops and economically important plants were derived. The diversification of genes, genomes, and important traits cannot be adequately interpreted without a comparative framework firmly rooted with genome sequences from basal angiosperms. A genome sequence of Amborella trichopoda will provide a foundation for all comparative analyses of angiosperm gene content and genome structure. Among basal angiosperms, Amborella has the most extensive genomic resources, already possessing high-quality genomic libraries, a physical map, and a large expressed gene (transcriptome) database. These resources, along with its pivotal phylogenetic position and moderate genome size (870 million base pairs), make Amborella the singular choice for the first basal angiosperm to be fully sequenced. The Amborella genome project will:  1) complete the physical map of Amborella; 2) generate a high-quality draft sequence and assembly of the Amborella genome using ""next generation"" sequencing methods and a cost-effective strategy that has been tested on rice genomes and is superior to traditional sequencing methodologies; and 3) develop bioinformatic tools and public access websites to display the project database as it is produced, and support comparative analyses and data mining by the scientific community at large.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Amborella genome, and the strategies being used to obtain and analyze the genome, will provide a unique scientific resource broadly impacting plant biology as well as excellent opportunities to demonstrate the utility of comparative genomics across the biological sciences. A reference for angiosperm genome content and organization will benefit the analysis of all currently available angiosperm genome sequences and those that are obtained in the future.  Comparative genomics workshops for middle and high school teachers will be held and teaching modules for broad dissemination of project outcomes and the utility of comparative genomics will be created. In addition, the project will expand a successful cross-cultural scientific mentoring program involving minority undergraduate students at each of the participating universities, train postdoctoral scientists and graduate students, and create mentoring opportunities for inner-city high school students to help them consider careers in the plant sciences. Specific mentoring activities for the post-docs will enhance their professional development.  The project website (www.Amborella.org) will provide public access to all data, project results, and long-term repositories. All sequence data will be deposited to NCBI as they become available and image data will be deposited at Morphbank (http://www.morphbank.net/)."

The result is differentiated bacteria living inside the cells of a plant organ that allows the bacteria to reproduce and fix nitrogen due to the provision of carbon skeletons and a low oxygen tension by the plant. While transcriptome profiling of whole roots during nodule development has expanded our knowledge of what genes are involved in initiating symbiosis, such experiments are unable to resolve the progression of events at the tissue/cellular level. In order to understand the signaling occurring between these cells in space and time in a coherent manner, it is necessary to analyze the transcriptome of the individual cells at specific points in time, as neighboring cells may have very different transcriptomes. The training components of this grant include training mid-career of the principal investigator (PI) in genomic techniques, training postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student in genomics and informatics through their participation in this research, training graduate students, postdocs and PIs from underserved groups in the summer workshop, and exposing underserved and economically disadvantaged middle school students to science and higher education through field trip lab experiences. <br/><br/>Transcriptomes will be measured for each cell type involved in nodule formation at specific time points tied to critical events during the progression of nodule development by use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNAseq and a systems biology analysis of the libraries.  The following questions will be addressed: What genes are differentially expressed relative to uninoculated plants in a given cell type at a given time? What genes show conserved patterns of differential expression from uninoculated plants over time within a cell type? Is there a synergistic effect of multiple genes showing small changes in expression but a conserved pattern? Which gene networks contain known nodule regulatory genes and therefore, by association, what do these genes control? What genes are misregulated in autoregulatory mutants at these early time points that allow too many nodules to develop? Applying time series analysis and systems biology tools, datasets will be created that will allow for these and other queries. Understanding gene regulation during the establishment of symbiosis is key to being able to recreate nitrogen-fixing symbioses in other plants, and understanding at the level of individual cells is required to generate a structure similar to a nodule.  The work proposed here will provide information about what genes are being differentially regulated in a specific cell type in the part of the root responding to rhizobia, about what genes are coordinately regulated within a cell type, and combined with published knowledge from mutant analyses, will yield information about which groups of coordinately regulated genes in which tissues are critical to early nodule development. The end result will be a spatiotemporal model greatly expanding our knowledge of nodulation signaling in roots and a data mining resource for the symbiosis community."

The brain has evolved hardwired neural pathways for controlling key social behaviors like aggression and mating, but basic organizing principles of these neural circuits remain poorly understood. This project tests how pheromonal signals-- chemical signals that impact behavior of the receiving organism-- are used to guide reproduction-specific behaviors, and how the corresponding neural pathways are altered by social experience. Like many animals, male mice form dominance hierarchies that strongly influence their behavior, where aggression is reduced in low-status males and preserved or increased in high-status males. The present experiments examine how becoming familiar with new social partners changes the way their pheromonal signals are processed in the brain, shifting thresholds for triggering aggressive behavior in dominant and submissive animals. First, to examine the basic biological processes that underlie learning, the investigators use single-neuron recordings to test the cellular changes that alter their responses to familiar individuals. Second, the investigators use new tools for visualizing neural activity during active social interactions, evaluating how familiarity shapes the patterns of brain activity corresponding to both dominant and submissive partners. Overall, this work addresses the neural changes that allow animals to adapt their behavior to reflect the history of their social experience with others. The project also offers opportunities for local high school students and undergraduate trainees from diverse backgrounds to engage in neuroscience research, including the use of cutting-edge technologies, and includes the development and dissemination of educational materials for local elementary schools and a science museum.<br/><br/>Key social behaviors, such as aggression, reproduction, and parenting are controlled by conserved neural circuits with strong similarities across species. Despite their critical role, little is known about the pathways that translate sensory cues into male- and female-appropriate behaviors. This project characterizes neural coding and plasticity in the mouse vomeronasal system, which plays a key role in mapping social chemosignals onto sex-specific responses. The main hypothesis of this work is that distinct behaviors are mediated by dedicated pathways in the accessory olfactory system, which are selectively altered by social experience to reflect individual relationships. It focuses primarily on aggression, a core male behavior that is rapidly and reliably triggered by other males, yet is also dramatically altered as animals establish dominance relationships. To characterize experience-dependent changes in aggression, these experiments combine ex vivo cellular electrophysiology and in vivo imaging of activity in the accessory olfactory bulb, a key node for routing sensory signals to central behavioral networks. The resulting data will address basic principles of sensory coding in a circuit intimately linked to innate behaviors, as well as characterize a novel form of cellular plasticity that may support adaptive changes in diverse social interactions. Together, this work helps establish how the brain organizes and routes the sensory signals that guide stereotyped behavioral responses, while still allowing flexibility in interactions with familiar partners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Under this theory, positive selection of mechanisms with early-life beneficial effects occurs, in spite of late-life detrimental effects. Understanding when and how such mechanisms become detrimental is crucial for understanding the principles directing the evolution of aging and the aging process itself.  However, our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of antagonistic pleiotropy is lacking. This award will support investigation of a novel mechanism involving the conserved C. elegans JNK protein homolog KGB-I to provide relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy and aging.  KGB-1 provides protection against heavy metals and protein folding stress during development but reverses its contribution and becomes detrimental during early adulthood, sensitizing animals to stress and shortening their lifespan. The project seeks to understand what causes the switch in KGB-1's effect and the general implications of the switch for aging. The project aims will be achieved by dissecting, genetically and biochemically, age-dependent interactions of KGB-1. Specific studies will be conducted to: 1) Characterize age-dependent and tissue-specific interactions between KGB-1 and other proteins; 2) Examine contribution of genes induced in a KGB-1-, and age-dependent manner to downstream phenotypes; 3) Identify proteins physically interacting with KGB-1 in different ages to characterize shifts in KGB-1's network of interactions. Mutant, RNAi knock-down animals, or transgenic strains will be used in these studies to examine genetic and physical interactions between KGB-1 and its mediators. Additional strains will be used to characterize tissue specificity in the contribution of KGB-1 to stress-resistance phenotypes and in its interactions with its mediators.  The research will provide information on a fundamental feature of the evolution of aging and provide a better understanding of the aging process itself.  Undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups, will be trained in scientific research, participate in research and scientific meetings, and publish their results during the project. In addition, science enrichment outreach to local elementary schools will be conducted.  All microarray data generated as part of the study will be uploaded upon publication to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database repository. Molecular biology reagents (i.e. plasmids, bacterial clones) generated as part of this work will be available to members of the scientific community upon request.  Transgenic C. elegans strains generated by this project will be available immediately after publication to members of the scientific community and will be deposited in the C. elegans Genetics Center at the University of Minnesota (http://www.cgc.cbs.umn.edu/) for wider distribution. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, preferably open access ones, and presented at research conferences."

Two species of canids, experimentally domesticated silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), have been selectively bred by humans for altered social behavior.  These behavioral changes occurred alongside a restricted set of genetic changes, creating an unparalleled opportunity to link the evolution of behavioral characteristics (phenotypes) to neural phenotypes.  Recent technological advancements enable detailed, non-invasive studies of brain anatomy at relatively low cost.  This project will take advantage of these innovations to create high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) brain maps using structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and digitized histology.  Expected products of this research include: (1) identification of features of neural organization that are linked to reduced or increased sociality or aggression, expected to be generalizable to other species, (2) the production of online fox and dog brain atlases that will be publicly available as a research tool for the general scientific community, (3) training opportunities for young scientists, and (4) outreach efforts using blog and social media posts for the general public.   Because dogs are a ""common denominator"" across various cultures, this research has a unique opportunity to be personally relevant and compelling to people from all walks of society, and to enhance public appreciation for science.<br/><br/>Both experimentally-domesticated foxes and domestic dogs are distinguished from their wild forebears by altered social approach-avoidance behavior.  Previous research in rodents and primates, and the researchers' own preliminary data, allow for the formation of well-grounded hypotheses about neural adaptations that result from selection pressure on social approach-avoidance behavior.  Specifically, this project will investigate limbic and fronto-limbic systems governing social behavior and response selection.  In order to identify features of neural system organization associated with altered social behavior, whole-brain white and gray matter organization will be compared (a) between various breeds of domestic dogs, each tested for social approach-avoidance/aggression behavior, and (b) between strains of foxes bred for social avoidance behavior, which react aggressively to social contact, versus foxes bred for social approach behavior, which are tame and friendly like dogs, versus wild type foxes.  Whole-brain MRI and DTI images will be collected using 3.0 and 9.4 Tesla MRI scanners.  Histology images will be digitally scanned and aligned to MRI images.  Analyses will include voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics, probabilistic tractography, and k-means connectivity-based parcellation.  The research will advance knowledge about how evolution modified brain organization in response to selection for social approach and avoidance."

While both are known to matter, emerging research suggests that ""nature"" and ""nurture"" are actually complex phenomena that are frequently difficult to disentangle.  This question becomes even more complex when individuals are part of a social group.  Therefore the goal of this project is to understand how social groups behave toward individuals with different sets of genes and how individuals with different genes might respond differently to the same social cues.  One way to make this problem more tractable is to use tightly controlled experiments with an animal species in which specific behavioral differences are regulated by a single gene.  The proposed research will use two genetically determined color forms of male mosquitofish that differ in the amount of aggression they display toward other members of their group.  The experiments will determine how group composition affects the behavior of juvenile and adult fish.  The studies will answer critical questions of the interaction between individuals and groups, such as how does living in a ""high aggression"" group affect the health and behavior of a juvenile fish, and does any effect of ""high"" vs. ""low"" aggression depend on the juvenile's own genetic makeup or is it regulated primarily by the social environment?  <br/><br/>Upon publication data will be stored and available on DRYAD (datadryad.org.  Results of these experiments will be broadly useful in understanding the factors that influence aggression and other social behavior in animals, including humans.  In addition, the project will stimulate teaching and learning, increase research opportunities for students from underrepresented groups, and contribute to public understanding of science.  The project will support the training of one female Ph.D. student, and will involve undergraduates from under-represented groups.  The investigators will also develop a workshop on animal social behavior and genetics for Florida secondary school teachers as part of a funded ""BioScopes"" project.  The workshop will consist of lectures and ""hands-on"" activities that can be adapted to the teachers' classrooms."

These bacteria may even contribute to the formation of precipitation in clouds. Little is known about how and why bacteria acquired this ability, which in scientific terms is called ice nucleation activity. In this project, scientists will study the bacterium Lysinibacillus parviboronicapiens, which was recently isolated from precipitation and which secretes a yet unidentified molecule with ice nucleation activity. The scientists propose to identify the genes that are necessary to synthesize this molecule, to study where the bacterium typically lives, and how it benefits from ice nucleation activity. One of the long-term goals is to understand the detailed mechanism this molecule uses to nucleate ice. This knowledge could improve our ability to predict amount and frequency of precipitation or to influence weather increasing rainfall during droughts or preventing damaging hail storms. The educational outreach components of the project are three-fold: the science of ice nucleation will be disseminated and taught to Appalachian high school students to increase knowledge and stimulate interest of possible scientific opportunities in their future; under-represented undergraduate students will participate in research programs; and graduate students will receive advanced training on ice nucleation, be mentored throughout their graduate school career, and produce data that can be disseminated via scholarly publications. The project will be evaluated on its effectiveness to not only conduct the proposed research activities but its ability to train and disseminate information to the three target audiences.<br/><br/><br/>Pure water super-cools to approximately -40°C before it freezes. Only in the presence of particles with ice nucleation activity (INA), called ice nuclei, can water freeze at warmer temperatures. Ice nuclei in clouds in non-tropical climates catalyze the freezing of water droplets that become precipitation. Circumstantial evidence points to biological ice nuclei as contributors to ice nucleation in clouds. Besides a single type of bacterial INA protein, little is known about biological INA molecules and about the evolution of INA and its role in the life cycle of organisms. Lysinibacillus parviboronicapiens (Lp) was recently identified as the first Gram-positive bacterium to have INA. Initial characterization of the INA of Lp revealed this activity to be heat-resistant, proteinase-resistant, secreted, and water-soluble. This project has the following objectives: 1. Identify and characterize the biosynthetic pathway of the Lp INA molecule and characterize the molecule itself, 2. Unravel the evolutionary history of the underlying biosynthetic pathway, 3. Determine the role of the molecule in the ecology of Lp. Accomplishing these objectives will provide new knowledge of how organisms can change the environment in which they live. Because of the hypothesized role of ice nucleation in atmospheric processes, this project may also improve our understanding of how bacteria influence amount and intensity of precipitation and, therefore, help elucidate the possible role of bacteria in influencing earth's climate.

This project leverages this opportunity, and the research team's previous work in the area, to understand how coral existing genetic variation interacts with acquired environmental modifications (i.e., microbiome and epigenome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to extreme climatic events. For this purpose, coral and Symbiodinium genotypes, bacterial diversity and epigenomic modifications will be directly examined, exploring their role in coral demographic and physiological recovery and the inheritance of epigenomic signatures linked to stress acclimatization. This work will be accomplished by a multi-institutional team, providing much needed answers to questions concerning the mechanisms by which foundational species acclimatize to rapidly changing environmental conditions. By better understanding the mechanisms contributing to stress responses, the researchers hope to learn how long lived sessile organisms may adapt or acclimatize to a extreme events. Established resources at Florida International University, the University of Puerto Rico, and Pennsylvania State University will be used to recruit and engage graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups in science in the research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rican agencies and local resource managers to communicate management and conservation applications from the research. <br/><br/>The increasing frequency and intensity of altered storm regimes will contribute to significantly reducing coral population sizes in the next few decades. While it is known that environmentally acquired modifications can influence coral health and physiology, their precise role and interaction with coral existing genetic variation to promote phenotypic plasticity remain one of the central gaps in our understanding of metazoan ecology and evolution. This project will be the first investigation into the interaction between coral genetic variation and two different types of environmentally acquired modifications (epigenome and microbiome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to high-energy storms. The proposed research will determine a) if modifications in epigenetic signatures and bacterial diversity are dependent on specific associations between coral host and Symbiodinium genotypes, b) if those modifications promote differential physiological and demographic performance during post-hurricane recovery, and c) if epigenomic modifications acquired by progenitors are transmitted to their offspring. Two graduate students and 2 REU undergraduates will be engaged in this research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rico agencies, convene monthly conference calls, and provide regular updates about this work to local resource managers. A formal evaluation protocol will be used to assess implementation and progress of the proposed educational and scientific activities (following NSF user-friendly handbook for project evaluation).

The proposed research investigates the fitness consequences of prenatal androgen exposure in a long-lived mammalian carnivore, the spotted hyena. Wild hyenas are studied in Kenya to document correlates and consequences of naturally-occurring variation in early androgen exposure. Cubs born to mothers with known concentrations of androgens during pregnancy are followed into adulthood to test a hypothesis suggesting that androgen-induced variation in cub behavior and morphology is associated with variation in fitness. Two other competing hypotheses are also evaluated, each suggesting different extents to which opposing hormone effects might constrain adaptive evolution. This work will permit uniquely integrated study in long-lived mammals of the development of hormonally-induced traits, from their induction in the womb to their consequences in natural populations. It will be important for understanding more broadly the role of prenatal androgen exposure in the generation of variation in behavior and morphology, and the role played by androgens in the evolution of mammalian life histories. This research crosses disciplinary boundaries and offers unique and highly valuable international training opportunities for American students. The work also trains Kenyan students, and supports Masai students in local elementary schools near the study site. In addition, project personnel work closely with the public media in the USA and abroad, maintain an educational website, and give many lectures each year to lay audiences.

This goal has both applied and basic aspects. The applied goal is to develop and make freely available novel collections of reverse genetic resources that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. The basic goal is to analyze for the first time how a high copy TE rapidly diversifies the genome of an organism and, in doing so, alters its ability to respond to a changing environment. It is paradoxical that rice, with the most stable genome among characterized crop plants, is host to the most active TE characterized in any eukaryote.  This fortunate set of circumstances will facilitate the application of next generation sequencing methodologies to sequence related rice cultivars and survey global changes in gene expression associated with abiotic stress responses. To this end the project will resequence five closely related rice strains where mPing has amplified to over 1000 copies during the past century and where it is still actively transposing. Comparison with the closely related reference genome Nipponbare will document for the first time the global impact of independent TE bursts in any organism. To assess the consequences of mPing insertion(s) on quantitative traits, the project will exploit recombinant inbred (RI) populations where the parents vary widely in their copy number of mPing insertions and where significant phenotypic variation exists for many traits.  The contribution of candidate genes with mPing insertions to phenotypic variation will be assayed in transgenic rice. To exploit the full range of mPing amplification, from very low to very high, the project will activate mPing in US cultivars and create up to 1500 lines carrying novel mPing insertions through a non-transgenic approach.  Finally, the project will use expression profiling (RNA-seq) to examine the role of mPing in reshaping the leaf transcriptome in response to abiotic stress.<br/><br/>The expected broader impact of the project includes the development of novel collections of non-transgenic mPing-mutagenized rice strains that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. All genomics data generated will be deposited at GenBank. Visualization of the datasets will be supported using in-house servers and at Gramene. All biological materials generated during the course of this project will be propagated at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart (AR) and seed stocks of non-transgenic materials will be freely distributed through USDA-ARS Genetic Stocks - Oryza (GSOR) Collection. <br/><br/>All outreach activities will be channeled through the PI's ""The Dynamic Genome"" courses, which will be taught in a newly constructed Science Learning Facility at the University of California - Riverside.  These courses, which are designed to replicate the PI's research laboratory, will serve as a conduit that integrates the research output of this project with the development of classroom modules for colleges and high schools focused on next generation sequencing methodologies.  As such, these courses will bring the excitement of next-generation technologies to undergraduates and high school students and teachers.

Corn takes up most of its water through a particular set of roots called the nodal roots. Under drought, the nodal roots must grow through dry soil to reach available water to sustain the plant. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that allow nodal roots to achieve this essential feat. This project will use a combination of physiological and genomics approaches to define the molecular mechanisms underlying how the nodal roots are able to maintain growth under drought. The information generated by the project will lead to the development of innovative approaches to enable corn and other cereal crops to access more water and increase yield under drought, and will thereby contribute to the essential goals of increased food security and stability. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Fort Valley State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU) located in Fort Valley (GA). The project will also disseminate research findings and provide information to the general public through various communication, technical training and outreach activities. These include but are not limited to science communication workshops involving journalism students and hands-on training workshops on metabolomics and the use of bioinformatics tools to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets.  <br/><br/>This project integrates root physiology and functional genomics [transcriptomics, plasma membrane proteomics, and metabolomics (including hormones)] to deliver a comprehensive understanding of nodal root growth responses to water deficit stress in both controlled laboratory studies and in the field. The project focuses on a maize inbred line that has been shown to exhibit superior ability for nodal root growth under water-limited conditions. A collaborative interdisciplinary team will address the following specific objectives: 1) elucidation of the physiological and molecular basis of nodal root growth responses to water stress using a novel divided-chamber model system for precise imposition of water deficit conditions around the growing roots; 2) characterization of nodal root growth and root growth zone transcriptomic responses in response to water stress in the field, using ""drought simulators"" for precise imposition of the timing, intensity and duration of drought; and 3) integration and analysis of all datasets using a suite of informatics tools to identify candidate genes that will be genetically validated in plants. This multidisciplinary strategy provides unique opportunities to greatly improve basic understanding of root biology under drought, and to broadly train the next generation of plant scientists. Data and biological materials generated by this project will be accessible to a project website (to be developed) and through deposition to long-term repositories such as the Maize Genetics Cooperative (for germplasm), and MaizeGDB, Gramene and the NCBI's GEO and SRA (for sequence and phenotypic datasets)."

For example, the tissue and developmental expression patterns of I&#954;B Kinase and Toll-like Receptor proteins will be determined using immunohistochemistry. (2) The derived role of NF-&#954;B in the development of a phylum-specific cell type, the cnidocyte, will be investigated using combined molecular and biological approaches. (3) Target genes of NF-&#954;B that play roles in developmental cell fate or other physiological processes will be computationally predicted and experimentally validated. (4) The functional and biological consequences of polymorphisms in the NF-&#954;B protein of Nv will be determined using a protein DNA binding-site microarray technology, as well as biological analyses.   Results from the studies will be made available through peer-reviewed scientific publications, presentations at meetings, and through relevant WWW-sites, including: StellaBase (stellabase.org); The Nematostella Web Resource (nematostella.org); and NF-&#954;B Transcription Factors (www.nf-kb.org)."

Gathering large amounts of DNA sequence data has become relatively easy and thus, models of host/microbiome function are accumulating.  Critically, most models lack experimental tests.  Working in a system that involves one eukaryotic host paired with a single bacterial symbiont the investigators will test models of symbiotic function to identify fundamental design principles in symbiosis.  <br/><br/>The project will exploit a very productive collaboration to further examine the nature of nutrient transport and regulation in insects; specifically, the investigators will exploit the model aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, to fully characterize the substrate and feedback regulation of transporters between the aphid and bacterium. The first objective targets testing whole genome based models of symbiotic function and regulation. The research team will transiently express transporters of sap-feeding insects in oocytes of the South African clawed frog to test genome sequence based models of symbiotic function and host/symbiont regulation. Because aphids are both a significant crop pest and excellent models for the study of symbiosis any work that increases understanding of basic aphid biology increases our ability to develop ecologically safe methods of pest control and may facilitate development of the aphid as a model for understanding the process of bacterial infection.  Functional characterization of transporters in the pea aphid and related insects will facilitate comparative work in other insect systems thus benefitting the annotation of transporters in all arthropod genomes.  The second objective targets bringing NSF-funded basic research into the lives of Americans through the production of six broadcast quality films about aphids, the science of symbiosis and life as a scientist.  The films will be supported by development of curricular resources that target early childhood and middle school children.

Relating ear morphology to hearing ability will reveal novel mechanisms of hearing and will characterize the costs and benefits of various anatomical features for hearing low and high pitch sounds. Because the development of ear structures is linked to the development of other skull features, this project will identify changes in the size and shape of skull bones that accompany changes in ear structures. Moreover, developmental analyses will determine specific genetic and cellular changes that cause the loss of outer and middle ear structures, a type of ear defect that is a common cause of human deafness.<br/><br/>Integrative analyses of skull features will assess whether associated changes in skulls facilitate the diversity of ear structures, with data publicly available at Digimorph (http://www.digimorph.org/) and the CSU Digital Repository (http://lib.colostate.edu/repository/).  The research in this proposal includes natural opportunities to better educate the general public and university students about hearing, biodiversity, and conservation. Within the US, this proposal will be integrated into undergraduate classes as part of a new laboratory approach to teach students to conduct and interpret statistical analyses. In addition, US undergraduates will participate in the research efforts and participate in developing a bilingual museum exhibition about frogs that will be displayed at one or more US science museums.

To adapt to this rhythmic environment, animals, plants and microbes have evolved circadian clocks that orchestrate daily rhythms of physiology and behavior on a 24-hour basis. Although the role of circadian clocks in driving daily biological rhythms is relatively well known, their role in seasonal responses due to changes in day-length remain unclear. The proposed research aims to understand how animal circadian clocks in the brain regulate seasonal rhythms in behavior and physiology. The objective of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms through which brain clocks regulate seasonal rhythms in the iconic long-distance migration of the North Eastern American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The studies will address a fundamental question in chronobiology and will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying photoperiodic responses and migratory behavior. This could have broader implications for the conservation of endangered migratory species, and for understanding their adaptive potential to climate change. Through this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored in biological clocks research and molecular genetics. Outreach activities will be conducted with local grade and high schools to introduce students to citizen science by participating in the generation of data on monarch migration patterns and the restoration of their habitat through monarch tagging programs and the creation of new Monarch Waystations. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed research is to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying clock-controlled seasonal rhythms in long-distance migration of the monarch butterfly. A fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which seasonal rhythms and photoperiodic responses in animals are regulated by the circadian clock has been hampered by the lack of genomic and genetic tools in non-model species (hamster, sheep, bird) that display robust photoperiodic responses, and the lack of robust photoperiodic responses in genetically tractable animals (fly, mouse). This project will take advantage of powerful molecular, genomic and genetic tools available in the monarch to (i) examine the role of circadian clocks and clock genes in the photoperiodic induction of the migratory behavioral and physiological switch, (ii), identify clock-output genes underlying the migratory switch, and (iii) disrupt candidate genes in vivo to define their impact on migratory behavior and physiology. These experiments will yield unprecedented insight into the molecular bases of insect photoperiodic responses and the genetic program underlying migratory behavior."

This work will take advantage of pre-existing differences in social behavior to test hypotheses about what systems in the brain are responsible for those differences. The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus Glaber) is a rodent that relies on social interaction and cooperative activity to survive in its harsh natural habitat. As a result, naked mole rats maintain the largest colony of any vertebrate animal, use a cooperative breeding system to raise young, and are capable of individual recognition of colony members.  A preliminary examination, achieved through the development of novel technological tools to track behaviors, demonstrates that within each colony, there is variability in the amount of time animals spend engaging in social behavior.  With the help of students supported by this award, we will use a social network analysis approach to identify animals with particularly high or low levels of social behavior, and measure whether brain expression of a candidate hormone, oxytocin, corresponds to these individual differences. We will also manipulate oxytocin levels in the brains of targeted naked mole rats to determine how this influences their place in the social network.  Finally, the effect of oxytocin on neuronal interactions in the naked mole rat brain will be determined by using large-scale recordings of neuron activity.  As the mole rat behavior and neuronal data are collected, they will be shared, in real time, through social media outlets to promote collaboration and provide unique educational opportunities for students at all educational levels. Teaching fellows, funded through this proposal will help to use these tools to develop new science curriculum for K-12 students in New York City public schools."

Naturally occurring variation (mutations) in genes that encode ion channel proteins can determine electrical properties throughout the nervous system.  To better understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function of ion channels, the investigators will use mutations discovered in a potassium channel gene found only among the weakly electric fishes of Africa.  They hypothesize that these mutations confer extraordinarily rapid molecular movements, and thus rapid electrical activity, enabling these fishes to produce rapid pulses of electricity used in communication and navigation.  The first aim of this grant will be to sequence this gene from a variety of African electric fishes to determine the evolutionary origin of this mutation.  The second aim will be to express these genes in-vitro to investigate the physical properties that the mutation confers.  This work is important because it gives us greater insight into the role that genetic changes play in determining electrical properties of all types of cells, including heritable diseases of the nervous system (channelopathies), as well as adaptive differences that may shape the nervous system in the evolution of new behaviors.  As part of their work, the investigators will train undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups in science, through coursework and laboratory experiences in molecular evolution, physiology and genomics.<br/><br/>Investigators will investigate the relationship between sequence evolution and biophysical properties of a potassium channel (Kv) exclusively expressed in the electric organ, a derivative of muscle, in African electric fish. Most electric organ discharges (EODs), are used for communication and navigation, and are extraordinarily brief (500 microseconds) within this group, however a few species have secondarily evolved long duration discharges.  One Kv channel (kcna7a) is abundantly expressed in the electric organ, and preliminary data suggests high rates of sequence evolution and amino acid substitutions in otherwise highly conserved regions of this protein, likely conferring unique biophysical properties. In the first aim investigators will perform RNAseq on electric organ and muscle tissues from 10 species of African electric fish strategically chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and waveform duration, and examine kcna7a sequence evolution as it relates to EOD phenotypic evolution.  In the second aim, investigators will perform site-directed mutagenesis on kcna7a channel genes, guided by discoveries in aim 1, express mutagenized channels in frog oocytes, and perform physiological recordings to determine biophysical properties conferred by specific amino acids.   This work will give insights into the genetic basis of rapid evolution of a communication signal involved in speciation; investigate novel amino acid substitutions in a class of medically-relevant ion channels that are universally important in shaping neural activity; potentially provide resources for making channels with hyper-fast kinetics for shaping electrical activity in tissue engineering and provide transcriptomic resources for laboratories studying other aspects of electric organ development and evolution."

Single-celled organisms called foraminifera present a unique and relevant opportunity in which to study the physiological response of marine life to oxygen-depletion. Additionally, given the ability to modify their metabolism under changing environments and because fossil foraminifera are used extensively for interpretations of historical climate conditions, an improved understanding of their physiological responses will bolster our ability to understand past, and predict future, responses to environmental change in Earth's oceans. This collaborative project also includes education and outreach activities. Along with providing partial financial and full training support to two Postdoctoral Investigators, at least three undergraduate students will gain first-hand oceanographic experience by joining a research cruise. We also plan to recruit an undergraduate student from an underrepresented group to join the project for a summer internship. Lastly, a Science-through-Art collaboration will produce a traveling art exhibition depicting the plight of marine species living in low-oxygen settings. <br/><br/>This project will identify how the integrative genetic, metabolic, and physiological response of foraminifera allows their survival under environmentally induced fluctuations in oxygen. The goal is to determine the physiological and metabolic responses of ecophysiologically distinct foraminifera to oxygen availability. In sediments that range from oxic to dysoxic to anoxic to sulfidic, three foraminiferal species will be investigated. Initially, a single-cell genomic analysis will reveal their physiological and metabolic potential. Identifying the metabolic functions encoded within the genome will enable predictions regarding their physiological response to changing molecular oxygen conditions, and allow for comparisons of the metabolic potential between these different ecotypes. Subsequent experimental conditions will specifically test and validate the genome-enabled predictions of the adaptations to changing oxygen concentrations. Integrating the genomic data with physiological and chemical measurements, models will be constructed to represent the metabolic activities of the holobionts under different oxygen regimes and geochemistry. These models will elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of foraminifera under aerated, dysoxic, anoxic, and euxinic conditions, and the predicted changes in key C, N, O, and S metabolic pathways will be further evaluated using qPCR analyses and physiological assays. Hypotheses will be addressed with these objectives: 1) Determine the physiological and metabolic potential of foraminifera under different oxygen regimes; 2) Identify the metabolic responses of each species incubated under different oxygen regimes, following periodic and extended exposure, and; 3) Define the impact of oxidative stress and ROS production on the health and physiology of the different foraminifera under different oxygen regimes."

Another goal of this research is to utilize collections of frozen tissue collected over the past two decades to test for physiological health and genetic state of the individuals that comprise both healthy and declining populations. Ultimately, this research will result in a better predictive power about how animals move across their landscapes, utilize resources, and persist in the wild by taking into consideration the physiological and genetic signatures of individuals. The PI's undertakings will involve many high school and college students, as well as graduate students working towards their master-of-science or doctorate degrees. <br/><br/>Sweeping anthropogenic changes to environmental landscapes in the late 20th and early 21st centuries pose urgent challenges to organisms and their populations. Potential organismal responses to unsuitable and disintegrating habitats are to move, perish, acclimate ecologically, or adapt evolutionarily. Predicting among these population outcomes requires long-term studies in which species, demography, physiology, ecology, and genetic variability have been monitored before as well as during a period of habitat change. The PIs will couple long-term spatial and temporal data, spanning 1976 to present, on variation in physiological processes and life-history traits with genetic markers of population health to develop a framework for integrating physiology, genetics, and demography in predicting responses of populations facing habitat degradation. Furthermore they will couple measures of individual state variables (physiological plasticity, genotype, and fitness measures) to link individual-level states and heterogeneity among individuals to population-level demography. They will accomplish these goals of measuring longterm heath indices by mining or longterm tissue and DNA collections on replicate populations of garter snakes inhabiting the northeastern Sierra Nevada mountain range. To accomplish the synthetic goals, mathematical models with structural equation modeling and additional modeling approaches will be developed and utilized. This will result in a fully-linked model of the relationships among physiological and genetic variation, organismal life-history variation, and environmental variation."

Nevertheless, this early expression of differences (and the later advantages) has not been the subject of much study. In one excellent case, hatchling male collared lizards that are setting up their territories develop a bright color signal and treat other hatchling males aggressively and hatchling females non-aggressively.

Reproductive health, fertility and behavioral problems have been linked to abnormal development and function of the GnRH neuronal system. There is increasing evidence that endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA) - a synthetic estrogen in our environment - have deleterious effects on the reproductive systems and behaviors in many species. This study addresses how GnRH neuron development, physiology and reproductive behavior, are altered by chronic exposure to low levels of BPA.  This project will use transgenic fish models, having GnRH neurons tagged with green fluorescent proteins, to address effects of chronic BPA exposure on: a) embryonic GnRH neuron development, b) physiology of adult GnRH neurons, and c) mating and social behavior. Experiments will use neural electrical recordings, confocal imaging, immunohistochemistry and behavioral observations. The project will result in understanding how endocrine disruptors modulate the GnRH system and suggest potential solutions for reproductive problems like ovarian dysfunction, miscarriages, pre-term births, precocious puberty and Kallman's syndrome. <br/><br/>This study will be the first to address the impact of BPA on GnRH neuron development, physiology, and function, in conjunction with whole animal behavior.

For example, the strategies and the signals that individuals use to attract mates and breed often depend on an individual's social status relative to others in the population, and that status can fluctuate as group composition changes and/or other individuals change in rank. Accordingly, the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that underlie such behaviors and signals are likely to be sensitive to social conditions. Yet, we know relatively little about these mechanisms, particularly in wild populations living under natural conditions. This project will examine the mechanisms that allow for behavioral flexibility, and the ways that those mechanisms evolve, using Australian fairy-wrens (genus Malurus) as a model system. These study species are uniquely suited to this research because they show pronounced variation, across both individuals and populations, in the visual signals that individuals use to attract mates, and a great deal is known about the effects of hormones (particularly androgens like testosterone) on the development of these signals. This project will use a state-of-the-art semi-automated radio tracking system to continuously monitor social interactions among individuals to examine the effects of those interactions on hormones and gene expression in the brain, and use experimental manipulation of social conditions in the field to demonstrate the underlying causes. Comparisons across populations and across the sexes will be conducted, making this one of the first studies to examine the role and regulation of breeding signals in females. Overall, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that allow individuals to adjust to a constantly changing social environment. In addition this work will build capacity in Papua New Guinea, a richly biodiverse region of considerable conservation concern, through key partnerships and direct involvement of locals in research, educational outreach, and interchange activities. Public educational materials also will be created, including short videos presenting results from the research as well as the process of doing the research, for broad dissemination through proven and highly visited internet channels. Thus, this project will have broad impacts on both conservation and public understanding of science.<br/><br/>A central goal of the animal behavior research agenda is to identify the role of androgens and other hormones in regulating expression of ornaments and associated reproductive behaviors, yet to date these roles remain unclear. One view, which has received relatively little attention from behavioral ecologists, is that androgens are phenotypic integrators that act to produce an adaptive multi-dimensional phenotype that is well suited to its social environment. This collaborative project will build on previous research with two sister species of Malurus fairy-wren that exhibit intraspecific variation in male and female ornamentation, making this system uniquely suited for examining these issues. The project consists of three inter-related studies that, together and synergistically, will address key questions regarding how androgens modulate expression of breeding signals and associated behaviors. First, high-density data on social interactions, collected from an automated telemetry array in conjunction with experimental manipulation of social environment, will be used to examine the role of social interactions and early-life conditions in regulating individual androgen levels and breeding phenotype. Second, a combination of observational, genomic and hormone manipulation approaches will be used to examine the extent to which androgens affect whole suites of characters to produce an integrated reproductive phenotype. Finally, hormone implant experiments and genomic analyses across the sexes and across two closely related species will reveal the degree of evolutionary constraint on hormonal mechanisms regulating ornament elaboration and behavior. By bridging the gap between the ways that behavioral ecologists and endocrinologists view hormones, this project will transform the ways that we view the role of hormones in regulating phenotypic integration and signaling."

Recent work shows that testosterone (T) treatment induces male-biased sex ratios in multiple species, and that it may do so by influencing which sex chromosome is retained in the oocyte during meiosis I (i.e. segregation distortion).  The idea that a hormone can influence the genetic material inherited by offspring has enormous potential not only for understanding sex ratio adjustment in all vertebrate systems, but also when considering the inheritance of other genetic traits that determine offspring phenotype. The work will advance understanding of how the environment and endocrine system work together to determine genetic inheritance, as well as the cellular dynamics of meiosis. The researchers will also generate educational modules for both high school students and teachers and collaborate on potential applications of this work to poultry production. The research will also afford research training opportunities to numerous undergraduate and graduate students and continue their participation in programs geared towards involving under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>The results of previous data support the hypothesis that T stimulates male-biased sex ratios through segregation distortion of sex chromosomes during meiosis.   To further analyze the effects of maternal testosterone, studies are planned to: test for the presence of androgen receptors on the germinal disc and follicle cells near the time of meiotic segregation;  test for changes in the expression of genes involved in spindle fiber formation and chromosome movement in oocytes collected from T-treated hens; and to determine whether T elevations at meiotic segregation are necessary for sex ratio biases. Histologic, endocrine, and transcriptomic analyses are planned in association with the studies. The research is expected to reveal the intracellular pathway responsible for segregation distortion, to identify key points of regulation, and to determine how the pathways respond to changes in environmental and social conditions shown to influence offspring sex ratios.

Recent work shows that testosterone (T) treatment induces male-biased sex ratios in multiple species, and that it may do so by influencing which sex chromosome is retained in the oocyte during meiosis I (i.e. segregation distortion).  The idea that a hormone can influence the genetic material inherited by offspring has enormous potential not only for understanding sex ratio adjustment in all vertebrate systems, but also when considering the inheritance of other genetic traits that determine offspring phenotype. The work will advance understanding of how the environment and endocrine system work together to determine genetic inheritance, as well as the cellular dynamics of meiosis. The researchers will also generate educational modules for both high school students and teachers and collaborate on potential applications of this work to poultry production. The research will also afford research training opportunities to numerous undergraduate and graduate students and continue their participation in programs geared towards involving under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>The results of previous data support the hypothesis that T stimulates male-biased sex ratios through segregation distortion of sex chromosomes during meiosis.   To further analyze the effects of maternal testosterone, studies are planned to: test for the presence of androgen receptors on the germinal disc and follicle cells near the time of meiotic segregation;  test for changes in the expression of genes involved in spindle fiber formation and chromosome movement in oocytes collected from T-treated hens; and to determine whether T elevations at meiotic segregation are necessary for sex ratio biases. Histologic, endocrine, and transcriptomic analyses are planned in association with the studies. The research is expected to reveal the intracellular pathway responsible for segregation distortion, to identify key points of regulation, and to determine how the pathways respond to changes in environmental and social conditions shown to influence offspring sex ratios.  Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at regional and national scientific meetings."

The growth of plants, in particular, is usually limited by the supply of nitrogen, and hence boosted by nitrogen fertilization. Most of the nitrogen needed by plants is needed for protein synthesis. The energy for protein synthesis is ultimately provided by sunlight, which is only available during the day. For these reasons, it is important to understand how protein synthesis is regulated over the day night cycle. This project will investigate how light stimuli and the internal circadian clock of the plant work together to ensure that the appropriate proteins are produced both during the day and at night. The project will also elaborate the cellular signal response mechanisms that allow plants to sense nutrient signals and regulate translation over the diurnal cycle. This work, to be performed in the reference species thale cress, will have implications for plant growth and development, and thus agricultural productivity, as well as the adaptation of plants to their natural environment. <br/><br/>This project seeks to decipher how the alternation of day and night regulates protein synthesis (translation). Recent genome-wide studies from this and other laboratories have revealed that the translation of mRNA into protein is controlled jointly by the circadian clock and by light-dark transitions. The stage is now set to tackle two major scientific questions. First, how are environmental changes in the light-energy landscape integrated with the circadian clock to drive cycles of translation? This objective will be pursued by manipulating the light and nutrient environment in the context of the time of day and seasonal cues and by measuring the efficiency of mRNA ribosome loading. Mutant strains with defects in the clock and in light and nutrient  sensing will be examined for alterations in the patterns of ribosome loading using gene-specific and genome-wide assays. Second, how do conserved eukaryotic regulatory pathways affect this form of translational control? Existing data have implicated the TOR kinase and GCN2 kinase pathways in translational control, but the precise contribution of these cellular signaling pathways to protein synthesis remain to be defined.  Using genomics, molecular genetics, and computational systems-biology approaches, this research will enlighten the fundamental basis of an important constraint to plant growth, the regulation of protein synthesis by nutrient supply in a diurnal environment. This research will also develop the scientific workforce in an area of critical need. Among other training activities, the project will recruit middle or high school teachers from East Tennessee to create lesson plans and curricular materials that will familiarize underserved students with norms of science such as model-based inquiry and computational thinking."

Because of the economic importance of catfish to the U.S. aquaculture industry, it has been a long-term focus of this laboratory to functionally characterize the catfish immune system. In humans, white blood cells play important roles in fighting infection. However, very little is known about these cells in fish. The goal of the current study is to better understand how white blood cells in the catfish recognize and kill bacteria and virus-infected cells. Recent studies have shown that a family of proteins termed Leukocyte Immune Type Receptors (LITRs) is expressed on the surface of catfish white blood cells. These LITR expressing cells are capable of killing virus infected cells. This project will determine how the expression patterns of different LITR genes change in immune organs and white blood cells during the course of an infection and also provide information on the types of proteins or molecular structures LITRs recognize. This study will also provide unique research training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including students from groups under-represented in science. The students will learn basic immunology and gain expertise in a variety of molecular and cellular techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will have their own research projects, learn how to design experiments, interpret data and present their findings at regional or national meetings. <br/><br/>Studies of teleost immune responses are important because they provide information about the various immune strategies adapted by different animal groups. This project focuses on the LITR immunoregulatory receptor family that is found in channel catfish and other bony fish. LITRs comprise a highly diverse multigene family and many of the LITRs that have been sequenced are structurally related to mammalian NK receptors encoded within the leukocyte receptor complex. Additionally, certain LITRs, as defined by their reactivity with monoclonal antibody CC41, are expressed on catfish cytotoxic cells that recognize and kill virus infected cells via the secretory-perforin granzyme pathway. This project will first define the complete LITR gene repertoire in catfish and examine LITR expression after viral and bacterial challenge using PacBio single molecule long-read sequencing protocols. Second, the ligands for selected CC41-reactive LITRs will be determined using recombinant fusion proteins either in the form of tetramers or immunoglobulin-fusion proteins. The LITR-ligand complexes will be isolated and immunoselected proteins will be analyzed by LS-MS/MS. Third, since preliminary sequencing has identified a small number of LITRs that resemble mammalian Fc-receptors, representatives from this group will be analyzed for immunoglobulin binding. The successful completion of this project will define the functional properties of LITRs and provide insights into the evolution of innate immune regulatory receptors. Moreover, this project will provide novel information about how ectothermic vertebrates maintain self-tolerance and recognize altered-self."

Naturally occurring variation (mutations) in genes that encode ion channel proteins can determine electrical properties throughout the nervous system.  To better understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function of ion channels, the investigators will use mutations discovered in a potassium channel gene found only among the weakly electric fishes of Africa.  They hypothesize that these mutations confer extraordinarily rapid molecular movements, and thus rapid electrical activity, enabling these fishes to produce rapid pulses of electricity used in communication and navigation.  The first aim of this grant will be to sequence this gene from a variety of African electric fishes to determine the evolutionary origin of this mutation.  The second aim will be to express these genes in-vitro to investigate the physical properties that the mutation confers.  This work is important because it gives us greater insight into the role that genetic changes play in determining electrical properties of all types of cells, including heritable diseases of the nervous system (channelopathies), as well as adaptive differences that may shape the nervous system in the evolution of new behaviors.  As part of their work, the investigators will train undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups in science, through coursework and laboratory experiences in molecular evolution, physiology and genomics.<br/><br/>Investigators will investigate the relationship between sequence evolution and biophysical properties of a potassium channel (Kv) exclusively expressed in the electric organ, a derivative of muscle, in African electric fish. Most electric organ discharges (EODs), are used for communication and navigation, and are extraordinarily brief (500 microseconds) within this group, however a few species have secondarily evolved long duration discharges.  One Kv channel (kcna7a) is abundantly expressed in the electric organ, and preliminary data suggests high rates of sequence evolution and amino acid substitutions in otherwise highly conserved regions of this protein, likely conferring unique biophysical properties. In the first aim investigators will perform RNAseq on electric organ and muscle tissues from 10 species of African electric fish strategically chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and waveform duration, and examine kcna7a sequence evolution as it relates to EOD phenotypic evolution.  In the second aim, investigators will perform site-directed mutagenesis on kcna7a channel genes, guided by discoveries in aim 1, express mutagenized channels in frog oocytes, and perform physiological recordings to determine biophysical properties conferred by specific amino acids.   This work will give insights into the genetic basis of rapid evolution of a communication signal involved in speciation; investigate novel amino acid substitutions in a class of medically-relevant ion channels that are universally important in shaping neural activity; potentially provide resources for making channels with hyper-fast kinetics for shaping electrical activity in tissue engineering and provide transcriptomic resources for laboratories studying other aspects of electric organ development and evolution."

These studies will provide new insight into how the fine control of this process occurs to repair damaged tissues, and how it changes in aging tissues.  In addition to its scientific merit, the project will also integrate research and science education.

This ""compensatory cellular hypertrophy"" (CCH) is probably a general cellular mechanism for post-mitotic tissue homeostasis, as it is also induced when some cells in the post-mitotic follicular epithelium fail to grow to their full size.  The PI and colleagues further found that CCH is induced by hyperactivation of insulin- or IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-like signaling (IIS) in hypertrophic cells.  In the proposed study, they will determine the mechanisms underlying post-mitotic cell competition and CCH processes. This research will address the following specific aims: (1) To reveal the mechanisms underlying loser cell elimination in post-mitotic cell competition.  Under this aim, crucial questions such as how JNK signaling is activated in winner cells neighboring loser cells, and how this pathway executes its effect to eliminate loser cells via apoptosis, will be addressed. (2) To determine the mechanisms by which loss of local tissue volume induces CCH.  This aim focuses on how changes in local tissue volume are translated into IIS signaling activation in certain winner cells, and how cellular hypertrophy is regulated. They will test the hypothesis that homeostatic CCH is induced by tensile forces caused by loss of local tissue volume."

However, each of these important traits is costly to maintain, which can lead to tradeoffs among the traits. That is, investment into one trait comes at a cost to another. The researchers propose an experimental approach examining simultaneous tradeoffs among three important biological traits (e.g., immunity, reproduction, and body movement) that will provide insight into the role of multi-trait tradeoffs in shaping how animals survive. Given that trait tradeoffs are influenced by the environment, these studies will occur in a range of manipulated environments that simulate the dynamics of environmental change in North America. Under stressful conditions, investment into one trait can take precedence over investment into another trait. However, if individuals encounter favorable environments (e.g., unlimited access to food), two traits, such as reproduction and immunity, may be maintained, suggesting that tradeoffs may be dependent upon food availability. The effects of food availability are often influenced by other environmental factors that may accompany reduced food availability (e.g., heat waves), and interactions between food availability and temperature may profoundly influence tradeoffs. This research will be the first to characterize the interplay between environmental variability and animal life history strategies using a network analysis approach. This approach has proven to be a powerful tool for studying diverse phenomena, such as social interactions, the structure of the Internet, and for optimizing solutions to engineering problems. Much of this research will be performed by students from under-represented minority groups, and it will be complemented by a science outreach program designed to educate community members (particularly K-8 students) on the importance of insect biology.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a manipulative approach in a wing-dimorphic field cricket to examine tradeoffs among investment into three life history traits of widespread importance: reproduction, immune function, and locomotion. Resultant empirical data will be used for a network analysis approach to characterize dynamic relationships among these traits through the determination of several network metrics (e.g., connectivity, betweenness, and modularity). They will also examine linkages between the life history networks and a network of underlying physiological traits (e.g., antioxidant defense and metabolic rate). Further, they will use a network approach to determine the independent and interactive role of two universal environmental constraints (food availability and temperature) in multi-trait tradeoffs and trait-trait interactions. Thus, the proposed study will use an integrative approach to better understand how complex trait systems develop and are maintained. It will have impact on multiple biological disciplines, including ecological immunology, ecological physiology, network analyses, and life history evolution. The researchers will provide extensive research training to students, many of whom come from under-served minority groups representative of both the region and the student body at Georgia Southern University (GSU). To complement their research goals, they will develop an outreach program designed to educate young people about insects, an important taxonomic group. They will create a website and an accompanying outreach exhibition at the GSU Museum that provides information about local insects. They will also construct and disseminate an educational module designed to meet the State of Georgia's Department of Education performance standards; this will contain structured activities, informational handouts, and live crickets that K-8 students can use to develop scientific literacy."

These vascular systems are made up of a network of thousands of interconnected conduits smaller than the diameter of a human hair, collectively known as xylem. As plants are exposed to drought, this transport system can become dysfunctional, leading to reduced growth, and ultimately plant death. Current knowledge of the overall connectivity of the xylem network is limited, and this prevents a complete understanding of how water and nutrients are distributed through plants, and also limits the ability to predict how different species will adapt to limited water availability. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the xylem network and its function during drought in northeastern hardwood trees. The research will determine which tree species are most resilient under changing environmental conditions, establish tipping points beyond which species cannot recover from water deficits, and develop a model to predict widespread tree mortality under droughts of varying length and intensity. These data will inform conservation and timber production management by predicting shifts in tree mortality given environmental change scenarios. An online database will be created where 3D xylem models can be downloaded and then 3D-printed for use in biology and plant science classes, providing a unique, hands-on approach to learning plant functional anatomy. The project involves close collaboration between a major research university and a primarily undergraduate institution, thereby increasing undergraduate exposure to a research environment and education in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Xylem network connectivity is one of the least understood areas of plant anatomy, primarily due to a lack of suitable visualization tools to study the complex, three-dimensional (3D) organization of the microscopic tissues that make up xylem. Plasticity in 3D xylem network anatomy is understood even less, yet it could have significant impacts on the movement of water, nutrients, pathogens, or drought and freeze-thaw induced embolisms. Furthermore, xylem network organization should influence commonly measured xylem vulnerability curves, but a mechanistic model that describes how these curves arise does not exist. Here, the aim is to use physiological and anatomical measurements of existing adult and juvenile trees, as well as juvenile trees in a common garden drought experiment, to explicitly test a range of hypotheses regarding the influence of xylem network connectivity in four dominant northeastern hardwood tree species. Using X-ray micro-tomography, wood samples from roots, trunks, and stems will be analyzed in 3D to explore the responses of trees to environmental changes over the past 15 years within close proximity to the Long Term Ecological Research site tower at Harvard Forest. A mechanistic model will then be developed to predict xylem vulnerability and physiological tipping points for each species at two life history stages to help understand how community dynamics will shift given changed environmental conditions. This project will support the career development of a postdoctoral associate, a beginning investigator, and provide opportunities for undergraduate research, including positions in the Harvard Forest Research Experiences for Undergraduates program."

For example, a human hand, a bat's wing, and a whale's flipper all arise from a common set of instructions that direct the activities of highly conserved molecules that regulate cellular structure, signaling, and adhesion.  Although these processes that give tissues and organs their shape are essential to multicellular life, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms that regulate the shapes of tissues. This project investigates the physical forces, cellular behaviors, and molecular regulators that determine tissue shape by exploring the formation of eggshell appendages in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) and related Dipteran (fly) species.  This work develops a novel technique to measure cellular forces and generates new genomic and gene expression data from across a variety of unexplored species.  Additionally, this project brings teachers and students into the laboratory to carry out independent research projects, learn firsthand about the logic and methods of science, and develop STEM lesson plans related to the mechanisms underlying, and evolution of tissue shape.<br/><br/>Epithelial tubes are important features of multi-cellular life and form the framework controlling the shape of many internal organs. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tube formation are heavily studied, the mechanisms controlling tube morphology are less well understood. This project uses the dorsal appendages (DAs) of the Drosophila eggshell as a system in which to study the control of tube shape. The DA system is an ideal system in which to address questions of tube formation both because the fundamental mechanisms underlying patterning and the initiation of tube formation have already been heavily studied, and because eggshell appendages vary considerably in shape from one Drosophilid species to another allowing comparative approaches. Within the context of DA formation, the investigators measure the pattern of physical forces exerted by follicle cells on the extracellular matrix, and test whether these forces at the basal surface predict the extent of tube elongation and overall tube geometry. The role of apical cell-shape changes on tube morphology, are also being examined with a special focus on the roles of the motor protein, myosin and the polarity protein, Par3 (Bazooka in flies). Finally, the group is profiling transcriptional differences between species with unique appendage morphologies, with the aim of identifying the molecular changes that facilitated the evolution of shape.  This work reveals and describes the forces that drive changes in organ shape and tissue morphogenesis. Furthermore the project provides hands-on opportunities for teachers and students to be involved in basic research in genetics, biomechanics and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They allow the peaceful yet unequal division of natural resources based on the dominance rank of group members. As social hierarchies mature, animals begin to alter their behavior according to their social rank. This project advances understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie social aggression and how social experience shapes animal behavior based on social rank. Using zebrafish as a model organism and an integrative approach of behavioral, cellular, including electrophysiological, and molecular analysis, the investigators study how social experience regulates identified brain centers involved in modulation of behavioral output according to their social rank. Specifically, investigators study how social status is encoded in brain and the mechanisms through which it regulates the startle escape response.  Zebrafish are an ideal model organism to address these key questions because they are highly social animals and form stable dominant-subordinate relationships that can readily be investigated. Moreover, zebrafish can be modified genetically to pinpoint specific pathways that control specific motor responses.  Results from this project will provide a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social aggression and how social information is encoded within the brain to alter motor activity. In addition, the project provides extensive research experiences for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds, as well as includes science educational activities for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This project investigates the interplay between hypothalamic dopaminergic nuclei and their modulation of the Mauthner neural circuit that underlies escape responses in zebrafish. The Mauthner neurons are a single pair of reticulospinal neurons activated by auditory stimuli and innervate contralateral spinal motor neurons. Supra-threshold stimuli activate the Mauthner neurons and leads to the startle response. The startle response is also prone to descending dopaminergic (DA) modulatory input from the hypothalamus. Building on evidence that DA plays an important role in social aggression, motivation, and stress, this project investigates the mechanisms by which DA controls escape behavior in animals of different social status.  To this end, a combination of molecular, electrophysiological and calcium imaging, histological, genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches are utilized.  Additionally, the project examines the role of nuclear progestin receptor in regulating dopaminergic activity.  Hypothalamic DA neurons express the nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr), a transcriptional factor that regulates expression of target genes involved in hormonal regulation. Prompted by preliminary data indicating a regulatory role of Pgr on DA pathways, experiments are undertaken to elucidate the underlying neural and hormonal signals that determine social regulation of the descending dopaminergic input to the Mauthner escape circuit.

For example, the strategies and the signals that individuals use to attract mates and breed often depend on an individual's social status relative to others in the population, and that status can fluctuate as group composition changes and/or other individuals change in rank. Accordingly, the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that underlie such behaviors and signals are likely to be sensitive to social conditions. Yet, we know relatively little about these mechanisms, particularly in wild populations living under natural conditions. This project will examine the mechanisms that allow for behavioral flexibility, and the ways that those mechanisms evolve, using Australian fairy-wrens (genus Malurus) as a model system. These study species are uniquely suited to this research because they show pronounced variation, across both individuals and populations, in the visual signals that individuals use to attract mates, and a great deal is known about the effects of hormones (particularly androgens like testosterone) on the development of these signals. This project will use a state-of-the-art semi-automated radio tracking system to continuously monitor social interactions among individuals to examine the effects of those interactions on hormones and gene expression in the brain, and use experimental manipulation of social conditions in the field to demonstrate the underlying causes. Comparisons across populations and across the sexes will be conducted, making this one of the first studies to examine the role and regulation of breeding signals in females. Overall, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that allow individuals to adjust to a constantly changing social environment.

For example, the strategies and the signals that individuals use to attract mates and breed often depend on an individual's social status relative to others in the population, and that status can fluctuate as group composition changes and/or other individuals change in rank. Accordingly, the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that underlie such behaviors and signals are likely to be sensitive to social conditions. Yet, we know relatively little about these mechanisms, particularly in wild populations living under natural conditions. This project will examine the mechanisms that allow for behavioral flexibility, and the ways that those mechanisms evolve, using Australian fairy-wrens (genus Malurus) as a model system. These study species are uniquely suited to this research because they show pronounced variation, across both individuals and populations, in the visual signals that individuals use to attract mates, and a great deal is known about the effects of hormones (particularly androgens like testosterone) on the development of these signals. This project will use a state-of-the-art semi-automated radio tracking system to continuously monitor social interactions among individuals to examine the effects of those interactions on hormones and gene expression in the brain, and use experimental manipulation of social conditions in the field to demonstrate the underlying causes. Comparisons across populations and across the sexes will be conducted, making this one of the first studies to examine the role and regulation of breeding signals in females. Overall, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the hormonal and genetic mechanisms that allow individuals to adjust to a constantly changing social environment.

Hundreds to thousands of miRNAs have been identified from dozens of plant species. However, their roles in plant development and response against various pathogens and other stresses are largely unknown.  This project will integrate the most recent cutting-edge genomics technology into the study of miRNAs in crop plants.  Students at all levels of education will be engaged in a variety of activities including teaching, training, learning workshops, and technology-extension. The project will provide research training in small tandem target mimic (STTM) technology, rice transformation, and functional studies of miRNAs for postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students.  Underrepresented minorities and women, as well as students from the Upper Peninsula region of Great Lakes, will be targeted and recruited. The project will also organize and hold a training workshop in STTM construction.  The knowledge provided by this project will be disseminated to the public at large through informal talks at appropriate community venues.<br/> <br/>This work will address key mechanistic hypotheses regarding miRNA evolution by answering important questions: Why do plants need so many miRNAs? Are they essential? What are their functional conservation and diversification in different plant lineages? This project will develop miRNA ""knockdown"" populations in selected agriculturally important crops as a pilot project using the recently developed STTM technology. These mutant populations will be further used to investigate the functional conservation and diversification of six highly conserved families of plant miRNAs, and to study the regulatory role of miRNAs in plant-microbe interactions. The project will provide a resource database, application and service for web-based materials transfer and distribution.  All sequence data will be deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

This project will investigate the ""genetics of forgetting"", by first determining which genes cause forgetting differences in Nasonia, a small insect suitable for efficient genetic study, and then determining how these genes function. The work has the potential to reveal new genes and mechanisms involved in memory. Species as different as insects and humans share some of the same basic mechanisms underlying memory gain and loss, so these mechanisms are likely to be broadly applicable. The discovery of genes for ""forgetting"" is likely to capture the imagination of both scientists and non-scientists, and will therefore contribute broadly to science education.  Educational outreach builds on ongoing collaborations with Jamestown Community College. Efforts are geared towards introducing investigative learning instruction using Nasonia in both high schools and community colleges. <br/><br/>The insect genus Nasonia is a tractable laboratory organism with a burgeoning research toolkit.  The insects quickly learn to associate novel odors with a host reward. However, memory retention following a host reward differs considerably between closely related species. In an exciting new finding, genetic regions containing reduced memory retention genes have been successfully backcrossed from the low memory retention species into the high memory retention species. The goals of this project are to clone the memory retention genes by recombination, identify how their coding and cis-regulatory regions differ, determine where and when they are expressed and whether they modulate expression of other memory genes following a learning experience, investigate their effects on memory retention using RNA interference knockdowns, and determine whether the memory retention effects generalize to other learning modes (e.g. visual stimuli, aversive stimuli). Given the genetic tools available in Nasonia and an established track record in cloning genes causing species difference, the project has a high probability of success. Data will be made available through National Center for Biological Information (NCBI) databases, the Hymenopteran database and through publication in open access journals."

Compounding the problem is that signal reliability varies between signalers and across time within signalers. Because communication systems are not intrinsically reliable, primates, especially humans, spend a great deal of time and resources assessing the reliability of information received from members of their own species. Surprisingly, hard-wired communication systems of animals with simpler communication systems than humans are proving no more reliable, and we do not know how receivers in these species deal with unreliability of signals. This project will focus on a species with less sophisticated cognition to examine how fundamental strategies have evolved to cope with unreliable signals, the most important outstanding scientific puzzle in the field of communication. The investigator will also continue a successful hands-on science pedagogy workshop series that brings inquiry-based teaching methods into middle school classrooms, as well as offering direct mentorship opportunities for minority college and high school students in the research lab. <br/><br/>The proposed project will address the central question by determining (1) whether receivers know when signals are reliable and when they are not, (2) whether receivers have strategies for addressing variable reliability and (3) whether signalers compensate for a receiver's lack of trust by providing more reliable information through other means. Male electric fish (Brachyhypopomus gauderio) are ideal for such investigation because their signal waveforms encode body length and androgen level with near perfect reliability, or virtually no reliability. Signal reliability in this system depends on population density and food availability. These variables will be controlled in the lab to promote reliable and unreliable signals, and to create prior exposure of receivers to signals that vary in reliability. Behavioral mate choice and male-male competition experiments will determine whether receivers assess reliability of a male signal by (i) monitoring prevailing social and food conditions, (ii) reviewing recent signal reliability, or (iii) whether receivers ignore signals and assess other, more reliable traits. The project will also determine whether signalers compensate for their lack of reliability by making the desired information readily available through other sensory strategies. Both raw and analyzed data are secured by the investigator prior to publication and made available for electronic sharing upon acceptance of the resulting manuscripts."

Genetic sex determination is one common mechanism, yet little is known about how novel sex determination genes arise, interact, and evolve in populations. Historically, genetic sex determination research has largely focused on a handful of single-factor, chromosomal sex determination systems. More recently, genetic sex determination has been mapped in a broader set of species, revealing a diverse catalog of sex determination genes in a variety of chromosomal contexts. Polygenic sex determination (PSD) has also been confirmed in multiple taxa, where multiple genetic factors direct sexual development. PSD challenges traditional thinking regarding genetic sex determination systems, while providing powerful strategies to explore the evolution and development of sex determination, including comparisons of siblings with multiple genetic modes of sex determination. In other words, while individuals of species with PSD develop as male or female, several genetic types of males and females may exist. The cichlid fish species Astatotilapia burtoni uses PSD to determine male vs. female development, providing a model to understand the evolution and development of genetic sex determination. This work aims to provide the most comprehensive analysis of a PSD system to date, using A. burtoni as a model system. The project should reveal novel genes and gene networks driving gonadal differentiation and development, while yielding important evolutionary insights. The research will also produce important genome resources for A. burtoni, a model for neural and behavioral biology. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will carry out proposed experiments, preparing them for careers in science. Additionally, K-12 teachers will be given direct research experience through co-mentoring by the researchers and the Kenan Fellows Program, together developing educational materials broadly scaled for state classrooms, regional public outreach venues, and the world wide web.<br/><br/>Multiple sex determination loci segregate in A. burtoni, producing many genotypic sexes and the opportunity to study the interaction of multiple sex determination genes within individuals. The proposed research uses an integrated approach involving genetic mapping, genome assembly and annotation of sex chromosomes, comparative genomics, and gene network analysis during gonadal differentiation. Aims include mapping and functional testing of multiple novel sex determination genes, and tracing the evolutionary impact of novel sex determination alleles on the structure of chromosomes where they reside, including functional evolution of linked genes. Gene expression analyses through sexual development will supplement these mapping and annotation efforts, and provide understanding of how multiple genetic sex switches are integrated during development. Gene expression analyses among different genetic sexes during development will also reveal core genetic networks underlying gonadal development, and yield insight into how genetic networks evolve without negatively impacting indispensable complex traits. Since A. burtoni is a longstanding behavior model, it provides excellent context for analysis of secondary sexual characteristics, including existing behavioral gene expression data, in relation to the various modes of sex determination present in the species."

Bivalves have high commercial value as seafood, and provide important ecosystem services, such as clearing water, stabilizing soft sediments, providing habitat and serving as prey to larger animals. A single bivalve can filter several liters of water each hour, selecting the most nutritious particles to optimize energy gain and rejecting undesirable silt and debris. While this general process has been known for decades, understanding the mechanisms bivalves use to accurately sort particles is key to understanding the role bivalves serve in complex coastal food webs. This project will investigate how bivalves identify and select their food particles. It is hypothesized bivalve feeding structures identify specific molecules on the surface of food particles. These molecular factors will be characterized using several state-of-the-art analytical tools. The project will provide research training to postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The project will also establish a series of outreach events organized in partnership with a public aquarium to introduce the general public to hot topics in marine research, including the importance and sensitivity of marine resources. Overall, the results and educational initiatives will contribute to the promotion of science in general and to improved stewardship of coastal natural resources. <br/><br/>This project will identify biochemical cues and underlying regulatory mechanisms that mediate particle sorting in suspension-feeding bivalves. Based on preliminary findings, the central hypothesis is that particle sorting in these animals is controlled by interactions between microalga cell surface carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) present in mucus covering bivalve feeding organs. Using complementary molecular and physiological approaches and techniques, the bases of particle selection at the levels of the cell, organ and species will be probed and the major factors that mediate particle sorting will be elucidated. Several lines of research have been developed to (1) evaluate whether carbohydrate-protein interactions represent a main driver for sorting across suspension-feeding bivalves, (2) identify microalgae carbohydrates driving selection, (3) determine the functional role of carbohydrate-binding proteins in particle sorting, and (4) assess how these proteins are regulated. Findings from this project are expected to transform the field by (1) validating a novel concept establishing the role of carbohydrate-protein interactions to provide particle sorting on-the-fly, by (2) generating data needed to develop a mechanistic model for particle sorting in bivalves, and by (3) supporting a new dimension for the role of some evolutionarily-conserved lectins in the Metazoa. Altogether, this new information is highly needed to unravel interspecific interactions that regulate pelagic-benthic coupling and energy flow in coastal systems."

Naturally occurring variation (mutations) in genes that encode ion channel proteins can determine electrical properties throughout the nervous system.  To better understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function of ion channels, the investigators will use mutations discovered in a potassium channel gene found only among the weakly electric fishes of Africa.  They hypothesize that these mutations confer extraordinarily rapid molecular movements, and thus rapid electrical activity, enabling these fishes to produce rapid pulses of electricity used in communication and navigation.  The first aim of this grant will be to sequence this gene from a variety of African electric fishes to determine the evolutionary origin of this mutation.  The second aim will be to express these genes in-vitro to investigate the physical properties that the mutation confers.  This work is important because it gives us greater insight into the role that genetic changes play in determining electrical properties of all types of cells, including heritable diseases of the nervous system (channelopathies), as well as adaptive differences that may shape the nervous system in the evolution of new behaviors.  As part of their work, the investigators will train undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups in science, through coursework and laboratory experiences in molecular evolution, physiology and genomics.<br/><br/>Investigators will investigate the relationship between sequence evolution and biophysical properties of a potassium channel (Kv) exclusively expressed in the electric organ, a derivative of muscle, in African electric fish. Most electric organ discharges (EODs), are used for communication and navigation, and are extraordinarily brief (500 microseconds) within this group, however a few species have secondarily evolved long duration discharges.  One Kv channel (kcna7a) is abundantly expressed in the electric organ, and preliminary data suggests high rates of sequence evolution and amino acid substitutions in otherwise highly conserved regions of this protein, likely conferring unique biophysical properties. In the first aim investigators will perform RNAseq on electric organ and muscle tissues from 10 species of African electric fish strategically chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and waveform duration, and examine kcna7a sequence evolution as it relates to EOD phenotypic evolution.  In the second aim, investigators will perform site-directed mutagenesis on kcna7a channel genes, guided by discoveries in aim 1, express mutagenized channels in frog oocytes, and perform physiological recordings to determine biophysical properties conferred by specific amino acids.   This work will give insights into the genetic basis of rapid evolution of a communication signal involved in speciation; investigate novel amino acid substitutions in a class of medically-relevant ion channels that are universally important in shaping neural activity; potentially provide resources for making channels with hyper-fast kinetics for shaping electrical activity in tissue engineering and provide transcriptomic resources for laboratories studying other aspects of electric organ development and evolution."

Additionally, given the ability to modify their metabolism under changing environments and because fossil foraminifera are used extensively for interpretations of historical climate conditions, an improved understanding of their physiological responses will bolster our ability to understand past, and predict future, responses to environmental change in Earth's oceans.

The goal is to determine the physiological and metabolic responses of ecophysiologically distinct foraminifera to oxygen availability. In sediments that range from oxic to dysoxic to anoxic to sulfidic, three foraminiferal species will be investigated. Initially, a single-cell genomic analysis will reveal their physiological and metabolic potential. Identifying the metabolic functions encoded within the genome will enable predictions regarding their physiological response to changing molecular oxygen conditions, and allow for comparisons of the metabolic potential between these different ecotypes. Subsequent experimental conditions will specifically test and validate the genome-enabled predictions of the adaptations to changing oxygen concentrations. Integrating the genomic data with physiological and chemical measurements, models will be constructed to represent the metabolic activities of the holobionts under different oxygen regimes and geochemistry. These models will elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of foraminifera under aerated, dysoxic, anoxic, and euxinic conditions, and the predicted changes in key C, N, O, and S metabolic pathways will be further evaluated using qPCR analyses and physiological assays. Hypotheses will be addressed with these objectives: 1) Determine the physiological and metabolic potential of foraminifera under different oxygen regimes; 2) Identify the metabolic responses of each species incubated under different oxygen regimes, following periodic and extended exposure, and; 3) Define the impact of oxidative stress and ROS production on the health and physiology of the different foraminifera under different oxygen regimes."

These vascular systems are made up of a network of thousands of interconnected conduits smaller than the diameter of a human hair, collectively known as xylem. As plants are exposed to drought, this transport system can become dysfunctional, leading to reduced growth, and ultimately plant death. Current knowledge of the overall connectivity of the xylem network is limited, and this prevents a complete understanding of how water and nutrients are distributed through plants, and also limits the ability to predict how different species will adapt to limited water availability. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the xylem network and its function during drought in northeastern hardwood trees. The research will determine which tree species are most resilient under changing environmental conditions, establish tipping points beyond which species cannot recover from water deficits, and develop a model to predict widespread tree mortality under droughts of varying length and intensity. These data will inform conservation and timber production management by predicting shifts in tree mortality given environmental change scenarios. An online database will be created where 3D xylem models can be downloaded and then 3D-printed for use in biology and plant science classes, providing a unique, hands-on approach to learning plant functional anatomy. The project involves close collaboration between a major research university and a primarily undergraduate institution, thereby increasing undergraduate exposure to a research environment and education in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Xylem network connectivity is one of the least understood areas of plant anatomy, primarily due to a lack of suitable visualization tools to study the complex, three-dimensional (3D) organization of the microscopic tissues that make up xylem. Plasticity in 3D xylem network anatomy is understood even less, yet it could have significant impacts on the movement of water, nutrients, pathogens, or drought and freeze-thaw induced embolisms. Furthermore, xylem network organization should influence commonly measured xylem vulnerability curves, but a mechanistic model that describes how these curves arise does not exist. Here, the aim is to use physiological and anatomical measurements of existing adult and juvenile trees, as well as juvenile trees in a common garden drought experiment, to explicitly test a range of hypotheses regarding the influence of xylem network connectivity in four dominant northeastern hardwood tree species. Using X-ray micro-tomography, wood samples from roots, trunks, and stems will be analyzed in 3D to explore the responses of trees to environmental changes over the past 15 years within close proximity to the Long Term Ecological Research site tower at Harvard Forest. A mechanistic model will then be developed to predict xylem vulnerability and physiological tipping points for each species at two life history stages to help understand how community dynamics will shift given changed environmental conditions. This project will support the career development of a postdoctoral associate, a beginning investigator, and provide opportunities for undergraduate research, including positions in the Harvard Forest Research Experiences for Undergraduates program."

Data generated from this study will be disseminated in the form of presentations at national/international scientific meetings, and will be published in peer-reviewed journals that can be accessed by other scientists and the general public.  New reagents and resources generated from this study will be freely shared with the broader scientific community and will be sent to archiving databases and repositories.            <br/><br/>Neurons exhibit diverse morphologies, and developmentally acquire the unique axonal and dendritic arborizations necessary for their specific functions.  Cell surface receptors are known to control this complex process, mainly by eliciting attractive/permissive or repulsive/inhibitory cellular responses in distinct neuronal populations.  However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying these multi-functional responses to receptor-initiated signaling events are still poorly understood.  The Plexin-A4 receptor that binds the Semaphorin-3A ligand is known to collapse growth cones on the axons of sensory neurons, while it promotes dendrite formation in cortical neurons.  The specific aims of the present project are to 1) elucidate the mechanistic logic underlying these disparate functions of the Plexin-A4 receptor; and 2) to determine whether the Plexin-A4 cytoplasmic domains activate similar or different intracellular signaling cascades during axon collapse and dendrite formation.  Novel mouse genetic tools generated for this project will be used to determine which signaling cytoplasmic domains of Plexin-A4 are required for these disparate functions. One candidate Plexin-A4 downstream interactor that may play key roles in both axon growth cone collapse and dendrite elaboration will be examined following semaphorin activation of Plexin-A4 signaling in sensory versus cortical neurons.  High-throughput, morphology based siRNA screening will be performed to identify additional novel downstream components of the Plexin-A4 signaling cascade that regulate dendrite and growth cone behaviors.  The results will provide key mechanistic insights about how neurons establish their unique cellular morphologies, explain how Plexin-A4 regulates axon and dendrite behavior, and identify novel molecules in the Semaphorin-3A signaling pathway that impact the formation and organization of neuronal connections during nervous system development."

Improving cotton production will help provide U.S. jobs, sustainable agriculture, and adaptation to a changing climate. Traditional breeding efforts have given rise to several types of economically valuable cotton strains such as American and Egyptian cotton.  These two strains of cotton were independently formed by the combination of two wild species, yielding cotton strains with four sets of chromosomes (two from each parent).  This doubling of chromosomes is known as polyploidy, and this project is focused on understanding how polyploidy shapes how genes are used to generate improved strains of cotton.  This project leverages and develops cutting edge technologies in DNA sequencing to understand polyploidy.  In addition, this project produces new biological materials for cotton breeding and improvement. The research goals are augmented by promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in the Mississippi Delta through active collaborations with two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. These educational activities train college students and K-12 teachers in cutting-edge plant biotechnology techniques, knowledge, and skills to advance their careers and use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Cotton is an excellent model system not only for understanding cell differentiation, elongation, and cellulose biosynthesis, but also for elucidating polyploid genome evolution and crop domestication. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) were independently domesticated from two of five or more allotetraploid species that arose from interspecific hybridization between diploid cotton species. It is important to understand how polyploidy-induced changes in genome structure and organization, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression have enabled selection and domestication of wild allotetraploids for worldwide cotton production. The project goal is to develop high-quality genomic and epigenomic resources for cotton improvement. Comparative analyses of sequence features and gene expression diversity among domesticated and wild tetraploid and diploid relatives will reveal genomic signatures for selection and domestication of agronomic traits, including fiber yield and quality and adaptation to the environments. Laser-capture microdissection and single-cell approaches will be used to reveal genomic and epigenomic networks during the transition from protodermal to fiber cells. Functions of the selected candidate genes for fiber development and epigenetic pathways will be determined using virus-induced gene silencing and CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing tools. Genomic sequences and epigenetic resources will be released to public data depositories, including National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Phytozome, and CottonGen. Plant materials including chromosome substitution lines and transgenic cotton will be available for the cotton breeding community. The methods, principles and resources being developed from this project will also advance the research on other polyploid crops such as wheat and canola.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project leverages this opportunity, and the research team's previous work in the area, to understand how coral existing genetic variation interacts with acquired environmental modifications (i.e., microbiome and epigenome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to extreme climatic events. For this purpose, coral and Symbiodinium genotypes, bacterial diversity and epigenomic modifications will be directly examined, exploring their role in coral demographic and physiological recovery and the inheritance of epigenomic signatures linked to stress acclimatization. This work will be accomplished by a multi-institutional team, providing much needed answers to questions concerning the mechanisms by which foundational species acclimatize to rapidly changing environmental conditions. By better understanding the mechanisms contributing to stress responses, the researchers hope to learn how long lived sessile organisms may adapt or acclimatize to a extreme events. Established resources at Florida International University, the University of Puerto Rico, and Pennsylvania State University will be used to recruit and engage graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups in science in the research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rican agencies and local resource managers to communicate management and conservation applications from the research. <br/><br/>The increasing frequency and intensity of altered storm regimes will contribute to significantly reducing coral population sizes in the next few decades. While it is known that environmentally acquired modifications can influence coral health and physiology, their precise role and interaction with coral existing genetic variation to promote phenotypic plasticity remain one of the central gaps in our understanding of metazoan ecology and evolution. This project will be the first investigation into the interaction between coral genetic variation and two different types of environmentally acquired modifications (epigenome and microbiome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to high-energy storms. The proposed research will determine a) if modifications in epigenetic signatures and bacterial diversity are dependent on specific associations between coral host and Symbiodinium genotypes, b) if those modifications promote differential physiological and demographic performance during post-hurricane recovery, and c) if epigenomic modifications acquired by progenitors are transmitted to their offspring. Two graduate students and 2 REU undergraduates will be engaged in this research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rico agencies, convene monthly conference calls, and provide regular updates about this work to local resource managers. A formal evaluation protocol will be used to assess implementation and progress of the proposed educational and scientific activities (following NSF user-friendly handbook for project evaluation).

These exudates use the language of chemistry to communicate between and among the biotic and abiotic components. Powerful DNA sequencing platforms and analytical tools for identifying chemical components are now available for profiling these interactions among the rhizosphere and the root components. The integrated application of these analytical strategies is limited by the ability to access and isolate exudates from roots and the rhizosphere. Existing exudate sampling tools are bulky, require large amounts of soil, and significantly alter the soil structure. This difficulty of sampling exudates has slowed the process of linking plant genetic determinants to rhizosphere microbiome genomic and metabolic features. This project addresses key design, fabrication, integration, and operation problems faced in developing next-generation root exudate sampling tools. The research will develop greatly-needed tools for probing the chemical exchange between plants and the micro- and macro-organisms in the rhizosphere. The root exudates are critical drivers of microbiome assembly and plant-pest/pathogen outcomes. The dynamic and environmentally responsive nature of root exudates illustrates the importance of developing sampling tools that are functional in a real-world situation, rather than the current tools that are limited to use in primarily artificial hydroponic and polymer-embedded systems. The samplers that will be developed will significantly impact the pace of research on rhizosphere microbiome by enabling continuous, spatially-resolved sampling of the microbes and exudates on roots grown in real-world conditions. This enhanced capability will meet societal needs to increase agricultural productivity for an increasing global population in the face of the uncertainties associated with climate-change, and thus develop new strategies to impact gains in agricultural productivity. This research will enhance interdisciplinary STEM workforce development by hosting at least two under-represented students in an undergraduate Howard Hughes Medical Institute summer internship program, providing research opportunities to four undergraduate senior students, and providing hands-on workshops to a high school Science Bound program to engage students in tech-transfer endeavors, while highlighting plant-microbe contributions to agriculture and global food security.  <br/><br/>This project will elaborate advanced technology for gathering high spatiotemporal resolution data of metabolites and microbes in the rhizosphere. This objective will be met by developing a modular toolkit for the localized sampling of rhizosphere exudates from roots grown in soil matrices. This toolkit will consist of (i) a single site exudate sampler, which will serve as a building block of more complex modular sampling systems; (ii) distributed exudate samplers able to extract exudates from key locations with high spatial resolution; (iii) spine-like flexible exudate samplers, providing conformational fitting at the root-soil interface, which will maximize sampling at this crucial interface; and (iv) parallel gradient samplers positioned radially outward from a root, providing access to radial gradients of exudates. These samplers will be uniquely coupled with microfluidic sorters to enable automated separation and isolation of microbes from the collected exudates for simultaneous analysis of both the microbes and the soluble exudates. Furthermore, these samplers will integrate miniature tensiometers, which will allow monitoring of local soil potential condition at the sampling sites, and trigger the automatic start of sampling. Rendering such a ""smart"" device will improve temporal resolution of sampling. Validating the utility of these integrated devices will involve installing them, collecting and sorting samples, and analyzing the interactions between the rhizosphere and genetically specified maize roots, grown under gnotobiotic conditions with and without microbes. The multidisciplinary research has drawn expertise ranging from microsystems design and construction, microbiome and metabolomics, to address the proposed goal and deliver on the specific aims."

This process creates new genetic variation in the progeny, which facilitates adaptation to new environments and purges detrimental mutations from genomes.  Thus, meiotic recombination is one of the main forces behind evolution.  In addition, it is utilized as an unparalleled instrument of plant and animal breeding.  In stark contrast to its importance, surprisingly little is known about mechanisms controlling recombination, particularly in plants.  Mechanisms of recombination appear to be different in each major group of eukaryotes and also highly dependent on genome size and complexity.  Recombination events are not evenly distributed throughout the genome but predominantly take place at distinct sites called recombination ""hotspots"".  This project seeks to understand why and how specific sites in the genome become recombination hotspots in maize.  In addition to contributing significant new insight into an important biological process, the information generated will be useful to breeders who are continuously looking for new ways to increase recombination for more efficient breeding of crop plants.  With regard to outreach and training, the project will develop a Science Undergraduate Minority Mentoring Internship and Training (SUMMIT) program which will provide yearly 10-week research training internships for minority undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to illuminate the mechanisms controlling distribution of recombination events in maize.  This work capitalizes on the recent success in generating a high-resolution map of double-strand-breaks (DSBs), which initiate meiotic recombination, and a high-resolution map of crossover (COs) in maize.  The plan is to elucidate why recombination takes place in specific sites in the genome and understand how the locations of these sites are affected by genetic and epigenetic factors. The molecular mechanisms of hotspot recognition will be unraveled by searching for proteins interacting with the newly discovered DNA sequence motif present at recombination hotspots, examining the role of DNA and histone methylation on hotspot activity, and investigating the link between DSB hotspot presence and chromatin openness. In addition, mechanisms that prevent formation of COs in heterochromatin will be elucidated.  This work will further the understanding of how recombination is controlled in plants and how it affects the structure of large and complex plant genomes.  All project outcomes will be made accessible to the public.  Data generated in this project will be made available to the public through the project website (www.rec-hotspots.org) and through the appropriate long-term repositories such as MaizeGDB and the NCBI's SRA.

An alternate idea is that there are many different genes that occur in many individuals, but each gene has a small effect.  Adding up many genes of small effect ultimately results in a large response.  This new idea changes the study of individual variation, its effects on human health, and the prediction about the future success of animals and plants.  This research tests these ideas by comparing different populations exposed to different environmental stressors.  Using these populations, the research team will determine the genetic differences among these populations and connect these genetic differences to physiological measurements. From these data, the team will determine the number of genes that influence the response to the environment and predict how individuals respond to environmental stress. The prediction is that there are a large number of genes that can alter an individual's response to environmental stress. If correct, this suggests that there are many different combinations of genes that work well to respond to the environment. Such a result would help resolve an unsolved question, why is genetic diversity so abundant in nature? Additionally, understanding, natural variation among healthy individuals will provide more accurate forecasts of how species will respond to a changing world.  Finally, in addition to the research outcomes, the project will enhance educational opportunities for local community college students and train of graduate students in integrative organismal biology.<br/><br/>How does adaption to stressful environments work, does it depend on new mutations or standing genetic variation, involve many loci of small effect or is it primarily due to a few genes of large effect? A better understanding of the nature of adaptation to the environment will provide more accurate predictions of how changing environments will affect species survival. For ecological and physiological processes, the classic hypothesis has been that adaptation involves one or a few genes, yet it seems likely that many genes affect fitness or biological processes that affect organisms' success. Although there is much debate, a potential major shift in our understanding of adaptive variation suggests that polygenic soft-sweeps involving many loci cause a selective advantage. Adaptation involving many loci is possible if many individuals carry alternative alleles in the ancestral population. With many alternative alleles at relatively high frequencies, adaptation is faster and less costly. The research proposed here will provide the necessary empirical data to address the frequency of polygenic soft-sweeps. In addition, the research will provide data to predict and quantify adaptive divergence.  This research will specifically examine the temporal variation in high-throughput sequences among teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus occupying different microhabitats and combines these with measures of physiological processes (CTmax, hypoxic-CTmax and cardiac metabolism).

A current challenge is to understand how crop plants regulate the formation and function of their roots.  An understanding of the genes that control roots at this level would help plant breeders tailor root traits to match new agricultural practices, land use patterns, and suboptimal soils.  In this project, genome-wide gene expression will be defined from roots and root hairs from a wide range of crop plants and their relatives under various environmental conditions. These gene expression patterns will be analyzed to identify key genes that control the formation and function of roots. Further, these large gene expression datasets will provide a valuable tool for scientists studying many aspects of root biology. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to provide new insight into the origin, diversification, and conservation of molecular mechanisms used to regulate the formation and function of roots and root hairs of plants. Further, given the important roles of roots/root hairs for plant growth and environmental response, these findings are expected to assist the rational design of strategies to manipulate root and root hair architecture in crop plants, a particularly important goal given concerns about nutrient-poor soils and the impact of environmental change.  This project will provide strong interdisciplinary training for the participating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. A major outreach activity of this project is a collaborative research visitor exchange program with the College of Charleston (SC), a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide large-scale genomic and computational biology experiences to students who are unable to obtain this training at their home institution. The project will participate in the Michigan Biological Scholars Program, a bridging program assisting first-year undergraduates in the life sciences, especially underrepresented minorities. Finally, aspects of this research will be incorporated into a semester-long laboratory exercise as part of an advanced molecular development course at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/>With the rapidly expanding gene and genome sequences available in plants, it is now possible to consider the ultimate goal of defining the gene activities present in every organ and cell type in species throughout the plant kingdom.  This knowledge would dramatically improve the understanding of plant processes and their diversity, and will likely lead to new opportunities for manipulating crop plants. This project is designed as a first step toward this ultimate goal by defining gene expression in a simple plant organ (the root) and a simple plant cell type (the root hair) in diverse plant species. In a preliminary study, expression data has been generated from seven species (rice, maize, soybean, cucumber, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Selaginella), demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research.  This project has two major objectives. The first is to identify sets of regulatory genes associated with specific root structural and functional traits, by defining transcriptomes from the three major zones of activity for the primary roots and other root types from a diverse set of crop plants. In the second objective, cell-specific regulatory genes will be defined by linking gene expression and cell characteristics in the root hair cells from these same plant species grown under normal and nutrient stress conditions. The results of this project are expected to have a significant impact on the plant research community, through the generation of root-zone-specific and root-hair-specific expression data from many diverse species, which will assist efforts to assign function to unknown genes, predict functional homologs, and assess gene evolutionary history. The data and materials produced by this project will be available at the project website (http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/PGRP-roots), the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)."

Changing the metabolism of crop species is one way to improve productivity. Thus, increasing our knowledge of plant metabolism can significantly accelerate crop improvement efforts. New DNA sequencing technologies have produced an enormous amount of data. However, it has been difficult to obtain useful metabolic information from those DNA sequences. The plant research community needs efficient tools that can extract information related to metabolism from those DNA sequences. This project will produce the tools and datasets that will be used to systematically characterize the components of metabolism: enzymes, transporters, and pathways. These tools will make it easy to compare the metabolic genetic potential of two or more species, and enable the identification of targets for crop improvement. This project will also offer training opportunities in biochemistry and computer sciences to postdoctoral associates and students. In addition, workshops will be offered at professional meetings to train members of the plant research community on the use of the tools developed by the project.

This proposal aims to meet these needs by developing a computational pipeline to enable rapid and accurate prediction of genome-scale metabolic complements of any sequenced plant based on the large pool of experimentally characterized information. First, the team will improve the accuracy of enzyme function prediction by adding new classifiers and features to a redesigned machine-learning framework. Additions of new classifiers such as phylogenomics-based function prediction and new features such as conserved protein domain architecture and conserved residues would reduce false positive predictions of proteins that share high sequence similarity with known enzymes but catalyze distinct functions. The team will also develop a new learning­ based algorithm to predict subcellular locations of enzymes and reactions for any plant species. The algorithm will combine the localization likelihoods of enzymes derived from the experimentally determined localization information of their orthologs and the localization information of the neighboring reactions in the metabolic network to propagate the localization likelihoods among all the reactions in the network. Another new algorithm will be developed to predict transporters and the substrates of transporters. All data generated from this project will be integrated into the PMN databases. In addition, a pipeline will be packaged to enable users to submit their genome sequences online and obtain the prediction results through a web server. Finally, innovative, integrated views of metabolic pathways with gene co-expression, transporters and subcellular compartments will be developed."

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Bradlee Nelms is ""Specification and Differentiation of Maize Archesporial Cells During Early Anther Development."" The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Virginia Walbot.<br/><br/>The fellowship activities are focused on understanding early anther development in maize. As a reproductive organ of a major crop plant, the maize anther plays a central role in many processes of agronomic importance. Defects in early anther development lead to male sterility, decreasing grain number and yield in many cereal crops. Furthermore, one of the earliest causes of yield loss in response to heat and drought is pollen inviability; thus, understanding anther development and male fertility will be important to insuring food security in the face of climate change. This project will increase knowledge of basic reproductive biology, information that can ultimately lead to breakthroughs in crop breeding and yield enhancement. The fellowship activities will also promote teaching and learning both within academia and in the general public. The fellow will lead an undergraduate-focused outreach project to design and market educational materials, helping to communicate the broad importance of the plant sciences to the community and stimulating collaboration between undergraduates from scientific fields and other disciplines. Further educational outreach will include mentoring undergraduate and high school students in laboratory research.<br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this research is to uncover early events in the development of archesporial (AR) cells--the first cell type within the anther committed to meiosis and pollen production. Major aims are to (1) identify cellular intermediates as AR cells differentiate into meiocytes and (2) investigate the role of TGA-type transcription factors in AR cell specification. These aims will be pursued using a combination of genomics, genetics, and biochemistry. Single-cell RNA sequencing will allow the identification of distinct AR cell populations, which will then be ordered into a developmental pathway by integrating transcriptome data with in situ localization of RNA transcripts. The subcellular localization, redox status, and DNA binding activity of several TGA transcription factors will be assessed in early stage anthers under various genetic and physiological perturbations, and downstream signaling pathways for the TGA factors will be evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Together, the fellowship activities will generate substantial transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data, clarify the differentiation program of AR cell development, and help to characterize the regulation and signaling of TGA family transcription factors during AR cell specification in a spatio-temporal context. Research results will be presented at national conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence data will be submitted to public repositories such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)."

It is estimated that approximately 50% of the world's wheat is grown in developing countries, where it serves as a staple food for a large proportion of subsistence farmers. Rusts are fungal pathogens that cause some of the most damaging diseases of wheat. Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina), stem rust (caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici) and stripe rust (caused by P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) are the most widely distributed diseases of wheat. These diseases reduce plant fitness and result in grain yield losses from 5-95%, depending on the rust species and the development stage at which it infects the crop.  Historically, breeding durable resistance to rust diseases relies largely on continually introgressing new resistance genes into adapted varieties, often from wild relatives. This long genetic process is not always completely successful in eliminating unfavorable characteristics brought in by linkage drag. Furthermore, there is genetic evidence that the functions of introgressed resistance genes are often suppressed in the hexaploid wheat genetic background.  However, little is known about the nature of these ""suppressors"" or the mechanism by which they act.  This project will investigate two suppressors of rust resistance in wheat that preliminary studies have shown, when inactivated, unmask robust resistance to the newly emerged virulent stem rust strain, Ug99, which currently threatens food security in Africa and the Middle East.  The project will deploy a multi-national team to 1) characterize these two suppressors and their mechanism of action(s); 2) transfer this new resistance to wheat breeding programs in both Kenya and China; and, 3) screen project germplasm for resistance against other emerging rust disease threats across this broad region.<br/><br/>The work has the potential to unlock an extensive array of cryptic rust resistance genes in the hexaploid wheat genome that are either currently unrecognized or have been poorly utilized. Suppressors of rust resistance have not been characterized in any experimental system, so project results will provide fundamental new information about the nature and mode of action of a previously-unstudied class of negative regulators of plant defense responses.  This research will have direct benefits for agriculture in the developing world by providing new, useful sources of rust resistance, with associated molecular markers. With respect to training and outreach, the project will provide an exchange program to introduce young researchers from Kenya and China to cutting-edge technologies, and to create opportunities for young researchers from the USA and Australia to learn from local knowledge in Kenya and China. The exchange program will train four young scientists who will work in the two labs in Kenya and China to deliver cultivars and to educate smallholder farmers of their nations. In addition, the project will generate three video protocols available on-line to reach a broader audience, including students, biology teachers, and wheat breeders in both developed and developing countries.  All data and biological resources generated by the project will be available to the public.  Gene expression data will be submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Mapping and marker data will be submitted to GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) and germplasm and breeding line information will be available through the website for the USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project (http://maswheat.ucdavis.edu/).

The study of epigenetics is a burgeoning and broadly popularized, with popular culture references outpacing the scientific data. What makes epigenetics so exciting is that it could be an entirely novel mechanism of altering gene function during evolution and adaptation. One type of epigenetic change is the addition of methyl groups to functional genes, termed ?gene body methylation?.  Such changes are known to occur in diverse multicellular organisms, from sunflowers to humans, but thus far there was no direct evidence concerning its role in acclimatization or adaptation. The proposed project will fill this knowledge gap using a reef-building coral as a study system. Corals are primitive animals that can be clonally sampled by simple fragmentation, which allows researchers to disentangle the roles of genotype and environment. Also, corals recapitulate ancient features of animal genomes better than conventional model organisms. For example, both corals and humans possess gene body methylation while it is notably absent from the model fruit fly and the worm. The results of this project will therefore be broadly relevant for understanding fundamental mechanisms of molecular adaptation in multicellular animals. In addition, the project will generate much-needed insight into the capacity of reef-building corals to adapt to the rapidly changing climate, informing reef conservation and restoration approaches. Finally, the project will train multiple young scientists and disseminate methodologies and results through workshops to the public and broader scientific community.<br/><br/>Gene body methylation (GBM) is a common DNA modification found throughout Metazoa, but its biological functions remains unclear. It has long been hypothesized that changes in epigenetic marks, including GBM, might modulate responses to environmental change and result in transgenerational plasticity, but thus far the evidence has been lacking. In this project, the function of GBM is addressed using reef-building corals as a study system. Corals are basal metazoans that can be clonally replicated and transplanted among environments, which makes them perfectly suited to disentangle effects of genotype and environment on any trait. The overarching hypothesis underlying the proposed research is that GBM is involved in long-term acclimatization, possibly spanning generations. The existing preliminary data indicate that GBM is indeed responsive to the environment and is linked to fitness of the transplanted individual. The experiments proposed here will include lab-based and field-based approaches and will investigate time scales of GBM modulation by the environment, its interaction with gene expression and fitness, and its heritability.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems within The Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences within The Directorate for Geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These metabolites are assembled from organic building blocks in a complex web of enzymatic reactions and allow plants to thrive in diverse environments. Many specialized metabolites are involved in ecological interactions, but also provide humans with diverse metabolites of nutritional and medicinal importance. The diversity and taxonomic restriction of plant specialized metabolism allows for discovery of novel biochemical reactions, and investigation of evolution on a macro and micro level. Fundamental understanding of the production of biologically active plant specialized metabolites will have broad impacts on improving nutrition and performance of crops. Specifically, increasing biologically active plant metabolites in agronomically important species provides a means to enhance crop defenses and productivity. This project will provide a fundamental understanding of how enzymes and metabolic pathways evolve, the principles of which can be applied to agriculture and extended to understand evolution in other biological systems. Training objectives include functional genomics, analytical chemistry, and bioinformatics. Broader impact activities include mentoring and training graduate and undergraduate students and organizing outreach events to raise public awareness of the plant sciences. <br/><br/>Plants produce a myriad of lineage-specific specialized metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, terpenes, etc.), which are synthesized from essential primary metabolites like amino acids. Many specialized metabolites are involved in ecological interactions, but also provide humans with diverse metabolites of nutritional and medicinal importance. Evolution of specialized metabolism tends to occur more quickly than evolutionarily constrained primary metabolism. This recent evolution in plant specialized metabolism has given rise to hundreds of thousands of structurally diverse metabolites found in the green plant lineage. The diversity and taxonomic restriction of plant specialized metabolism allows for discovery of novel biochemical reactions, and investigation of evolution on a macro, metabolic pathway, and micro, enzyme, level. Sugar esters (acylsugars) are a group of specialized metabolites restricted to many species within the nightshade family (Solanaceae) that consist of a sugar core decorated with diverse acyl chains and have plant defense and commercial properties. The acyl chains attached to acylsugars vary in number, length, and branching pattern, which gives rise to natural variation in acylsugar types and abundance within Solanaceae. Branched-chain amino acids are the direct precursors of C4-C5 acyl chains, but synthesis of longer acyl chains requires elongation. However, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for chain elongation remain unknown. This project will leverage the wealth of data encompassing the Solanaceae to identify biochemical mechanisms and evolutionary processes leading to the diversity of acylsugars. Using comparative genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, biochemistry and traditional genetics, this project aims to identify and biochemically characterize the acyl chain elongation pathway in tomato and closely-related wild relatives, validate in vitro biochemistry by testing the in vivo function of the identified enzymes, and engineer the Solanum acyl chain elongation pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to reconstitute the pathway and enhance production of biologically active acylsugars. All data obtained through this project will be submitted to publicly available websites and repositories and manuscripts will be published in open access journals.<br/><br/>Keywords: biochemistry, specialized metabolism, defense compounds, acylsugar, chain elongation<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research program investigates the physiological responses of the model genetic organism Drosophila melanogaster to a complex environment. D. melanogaster recently expanded its range out of tropical Africa and into higher latitudes with more variable thermal environments. At the same time, D. melanogaster evolved a remarkable tolerance of ethanol and acetic acid in its fermenting fruit habitat. The natural history of this fruit fly allows for an investigation of how organisms are likely to respond to a complex and increasingly variable climate. In particular, this research will test hypotheses about how changes in cell membranes and metabolism maintain health, performance and fitness in a thermally-variable and alcohol-rich niche. The experiments investigate changes that occur within the lifespan of organisms to deal with the environment -- plastic physiologies -- and changes that have evolved to fit organisms to their environment via the process of natural selection physiological adaptations. The goal of this research is to identify the interactions among multiple genes that underlie these plastic and adaptive responses to a complex environment.<br/><br/>The proposed research will further our knowledge in areas identified by the Frontiers in Evolutionary Biology workshop (NSF 2005), provide insight on genetic, cellular and physiological mechanisms of environmental tolerance, and develop new methods for associating physiological traits with complex genetic variation at multiple genes.

However, plant pathogens greatly reduce crop yields, negatively impacting these important goals. One approach to crop pathogen management is to develop highly disease-resistant crops, and an important aspect of engineering durable crop pathogen resistance is elucidating and manipulating resistance pathways in model organisms. Increasing evidence shows that for a plant to manifest a fully active defense response against pathogens, cells need to make sure that the correct proteins are in the correct location. In this project, a novel hub controlling the cellular movement of defense-related proteins has been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Understanding the full roles and regulation of this hub can lead to unique strategies for improving crop protection. In addition to its biological importance, this project will provide multi-disciplinary training to better prepare young scientists to be successful members of the national scientific work force. In addition, undergraduate students will be recruited into an established, multi-lab research training program to improve the scientific understanding and literacy of first year university students.<br/><br/>The trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE) is a protein sorting station of increasing importance in plant immunity against diverse microbial pathogens in model and crops species. The role of the TGN/EE in trafficking of immune cargo proteins to/from the plant cell surface is critical, so that the cargo proteins can reach their site of function to establish effective defenses prior to or in response to pathogen infection. However, little is known about the molecular machinery that govern trafficking of immune cargo at the TGN/EE. Here, the PI and Co-PI will utilize cross-disciplinary approaches including immune-signaling and bacterial infection assays, plasma membrane and apoplast proteomics, and live-cell imaging to understand how the individual and combined roles of clathrin-coat proteins control their trafficking function at the TGN/EE to maintain the correct location and abundance of defense-related cargo proteins at the cell surface. Data and tools generated from this proposal will allow formulating new testable hypotheses on how to manipulate trafficking of defense cargo components for increased immunity to bacteria and other pathogens. PM proteins are involved in all aspects of plant biology from plant defense to development, hormone and nutrient acquisition. Thus, gained knowledge will generate insights into regulatory roles of clathrin-mediated trafficking beyond plant immunity.

Vierstra (University of Wisconsin - Madison)<br/><br/>CoPI:  Marisa S. Otegui (University of Wisconsin - Madison)<br/><br/>Plants employ sophisticated mechanisms to traffic and recycle intracellular constituents needed for growth and development, housekeeping, and survival under nutrient stress. One involves the sequestration of cytoplasmic material in autophagic vesicles and subsequent delivery of these vesicles to the vacuole for breakdown or storage. Prior work made substantial progress toward defining the mechanisms underpinning autophagy through molecular, genetic, and imaging analyses of a set of essential autophagy-related (ATG)  components in both Arabidopsis and maize.  Of relevance to agriculture were recent findings that autophagy is critical to nitrogen-use efficiency in maize and the discovery of a novel autophagic route that operates in maize seeds.  The objectives of this project are to: (i) further define the maize ATG system at the biochemical and genetic levels; (ii) provide an integrated view of how autophagy impacts maize growth, development, and yield during nitrogen stress by combining  atg  mutants with phenotypic, cell biological, proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses; (iii) identify the cargo degraded by autophagy via proteomic characterizations of autophagic vesicles;  and  (iv) define the molecular mechanism underpinning ATG-independent autophagy during maize seed protein accumulation.  Collectively, this research will provide the first systems view of autophagy in a crop plant and its role in nitrogen-use efficiency.  More broadly, this research  will also generate important reagents, techniques, mutants, transgenic lines, germplasm, and cargo catalogs that will provide a much needed foundation to appreciate autophagy in the important crop, maize.  With such knowledge, it should be possible to re-engineer crops that more efficiently use nitrogen and other nutrients, that better remobilize these nutrients to areas of new growth and storage, that display improved leaf senescence and fruit ripening characteristics, and that provide better grain yields.<br/><br/>As a broader impact, this project is designed to provide an interdisciplinary vehicle for training the next generation of plant scientists using state-of-the-art genetic, proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and cell biological approaches to study crop physiology. Participants include research scientists, graduate students, and several undergraduates at Wisconsin or attending the UW-summer REU experience hosted by  the  Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program, as well as high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program (YAP) in Biotechnology.  YAP-Biotechnology is designed to expand the workforce in biological sciences by providing practical training to high school juniors and seniors through formal technology classes combined with real-life research experiences. Additional educational impacts involve cell biology workshops developed by the CoPI, who serves as the supervisor of the NSF-sponsored Plant Imaging Center, related to the next generation tomographic imaging techniques that will be refined during this  project. Some of these refinements will be developed through an Introduction to Engineering Design course project organized by the UW-School of Engineering that will create devices optimized for imaging maize endosperms.   Free and unencumbered public access to the RNA-seq, metabolomic, and proteomic datasets generated by this project will be facilitated by deposition of the data at MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/) and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) public repositories.

For any species, the maximum group size represents a breaking point, where the costs of group-living outweigh the benefits. Yet, most research on the social dynamics of groups has focused on societies with one level of social organization. These ""single-level societies"" are bound to one compromise solution when faced with competing selective pressures - grow in size to protect against predation? Or, shrink in size to alleviate feeding competition? Yet, a few societies have solved this group-size conundrum through the evolution of ""multi-level societies"" - comprising many modular core groups where individuals within the core group are consistent while the associations between core groups can quickly change. This research will explore how individuals transitioned from single- to multi-level societies by investigating the multilevel society of a wild primate, the gelada. This project asks two questions that each focus on a hallmark of gelada society. First, what permanently splits groups apart? And, second, what keeps groups together - forming the higher levels? This project has previously demonstrated that geladas have an unusually high tolerance for strangers. Identifying the mechanisms behind this remarkable tolerance could help us understand the evolution of another species' tolerance for strangers - humans. The directors of this project will continue a long-standing tradition of national and international STEM outreach (http://geladaresearch.org/db) and  significant time investment into conservation efforts in Ethiopia through Save the Simiens, a 501(c)(3) non-profit they created dedicated to protecting the wildlife of the Simien Mountains National Park of Ethiopia where the research takes place. This project is co-funded by the Animal Behavior Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Biological Anthropology Program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to identify how individual interactions lead to the higher-order structure of multi-level societies by harnessing long-term data on multiple core groups of wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), an easy-to-observe primate with a multilevel society. Specifically, this project will identify: (1) what causes core groups to split up (i.e., fission into two or more core groups) and (2) what causes multiple core groups to remain together (i.e., maintain higher-level cohesion). This research will investigate the fitness consequences of behaviors that produce a multi-level society and examine the mechanistic processes by which group structure may emerge from individual interactions. To understand why groups fission, it is necessary to track network dynamics to examine female social networks before and after a fission to identify the changes in social relationships that may predict an impending fission. To understand higher-level cohesion, this research will use GPS collars to track simultaneous movement across core groups that have (and have not) undergone fission. Thus, these results will identify the ""decay"" in association patterns across time. By identifying the origin of two key features of multilevel societies - small core groups and cohesion among those groups - this research will uncover not just why gelada units fission but how they fission; and this evolutionary pathway can then be tested in other taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal will address three of these fundamental questions: (1) how are birds adjusting their song to the urban environment?; (2) how has song urbanization affected signal information?; and (3) are urban songs adaptive? To address these questions, this study will employ behavioral, ecological and mechanistic modeling approaches, using an established NSF model organism for behavioral studies, white-crowned sparrows. Meeting the proposal's objectives will transform the state of understanding of urban-dependent selection on mating behaviors and, more broadly, the adaptations of species that persist in urban environments.

Many developmental decisions are made within the first hours of emergence of the seedling from the ground. These decisions are in direct response to the seedling's environment, particularly with respect to the available light. Both light quantity and quality are sensed using elaborate light receptor mechanisms, which translate the obtained information into various growth responses. One of these light receptors is called phytochrome, which consists of a light-sensing molecule called the chromophore and an attached protein called the apoprotein. A small family of genes encodes multiple types of phytochrome apoproteins that can bind to additional identical or very similar molecules. These protein complexes can bind to DNA and direct the transcription of genes, thus ultimately allowing for a multitude of physiological responses in the plant. This project will use a genome wide approach to directly compare transcriptional and proteomic changes in tomato seedlings and several phytochrome mutants during early development. It is expected that this project will reveal novel functions of the lesser-studied phytochrome genes, and identify new interactions of light-response genes, both on the transcript and the protein level during early seedling responses to light.<br/><br/>Tomato is both a major agronomic crop and a model organism for the study of fleshy fruits.

An animal lives with trillions of microorganisms in its body, yet the implications of having most of these microorganisms are unknown. What is known thus far has focused primarily on the importance of microorganisms for digestion. However, current work suggests that an animal's microbes have effects that extend far beyond the gut, impacting the immune system and even stress. This project seeks to understand the importance of these microorganisms for health and survival in free-living populations of endangered iguanas that are exposed to changing and unnatural diets via ecotourism. The project will test how changing microbial communities and key physiological parameters relate to reproduction and survival in natural populations. Additionally, in the laboratory the researchers will experimentally test how changes in diet, stress, and microbes affect health and physiology in order to understand what is causing the observed changes in wild iguanas. Connecting physiological and microbial changes with animal population fluctuations in nature will be an innovative step forward. Finally, understanding both the occurrence and direction of these interactions will provide important insights into the effects of human-induced diet shifts on wildlife and much needed biological knowledge regarding threatened species.  Humans have microbes in their digestive track as well, thus this project project may have broad implications on human health in relation to diet and stress. <br/><br/>Many recent studies have identified significant connections between the microbiome and host health in model systems. However, mechanistic links between the microbiome and physiological functions that are key to health and survival remain mostly unexplored. Given that evolutionary history is one of the primary determinants of microbiome composition, the lack of taxonomic breadth severely restricts understanding of the physiological link between host habitat, diet, and immunity with microbiome composition and metagenomic function. There is also a paucity of research investigating microbial communities and health-related metrics within free-living animals. Thus, current knowledge of these relationships lacks critical ecological relevance and an understanding of the impact of environmental changes on endo-microbial communities. To address these current knowledge gaps, the project will study iguanas in both natural and captive settings, in order to test relationships among ecoimmune indices, anthropogenic-based diet changes, and the microbiome across a fragmented, insular landscape in The Bahamas. In the laboratory, the principal investigators will perform ecologically-relevant experimental manipulations in captive iguanas to test directional relationships in wild populations.

They are ubiquitous in nature and extremely diverse, yet their ecological roles are not well-defined. In this project, wild lima bean, passion vine and a defined set of fungal endophytes isolated from leaves of these plant species will be studied to understand ecological functions of endophytes as plant symbionts. In particular, the research focuses on endophyte-mediated effects on plant defenses against insect herbivores. Lima bean and passion vine are both well-established model systems and express a range of well-characterized direct and indirect defenses. This allows for disentangling of the interplay of plant-derived and endophyte-mediated effects. Beyond a better understanding of the ecological implications of plant-endophyte interactions, this research also provides novel insights for agricultural sciences, as endophytes can potentially be used to enhance plant stress tolerance to a broad variety of biotic (e.g. insect pests and pathogens) and abiotic stress factors (e.g. soil salinity, drought, high temperature, and heavy metal accumulation). The exploration of novel ways to enhance crop production, through the utilization of beneficial microbes that enhance plant stress tolerance, may help to alleviate the impending socio-economic challenges facing humanity.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in chemical analytical and molecular techniques, data analysis and scientific writing. Opportunities for K-12 school teachers and students to participate in this multidisciplinary research will be provided through lectures, lab experiences and summer field courses.<br/><br/>Fungal endophytes are exceptional biochemical engineers that produce a variety of ecologically relevant compounds. These compounds potentially affect the interaction of host plants with plant consumers and higher trophic levels. In addition to the production of fungal compounds, endophytes may alter the defensive plant chemical phenotype through up- or down-regulation of primary and secondary plant compounds. However, the functional interactions between plants, endophytes and other plant-associated organisms in natural ecosystems are virtually unknown. The aim of this research is to provide a new and functional understanding of these complex interactions by integrating laboratory and field studies to answer the following specific questions: 1) Does endophyte colonization affect herbivorous and predatory insects? 2) How does endophyte colonization alter the plant chemical phenotype? 3) Does inoculation with endophytes affect host plant performance in nature? and 4) Are endophyte-mediated traits transferable across plant species boundaries and generations? In a comparative metabolomics approach, effects of endophyte inoculations on complex compound pools are analyzed in planta. Beyond this non-targeted approach, high-throughput bioactivity profiling studies will be used to search for bioactive fungal compounds.

Key proteins at the cell surface need to be able to transiently interact with each other when they encounter specific stimuli to trigger a response within the cell. How do the signaling partners find each other in a sea of membrane lipids? A mechanism that cells use to confine membrane proteins to specific domains in a continuous membrane is the expression of proteins that are able to establish protein networks or webs. Tetraspanins are evolutionarily-conserved proteins that facilitate the formation of protein networks and establish signaling modules involved in intercellular communication, cell proliferation, development, and specific responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. However, there is very little experimental data on their exact molecular mechanisms and what physiological roles they play in plants. This project will analyze the function of tetraspanin and tetraspanin-like proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand their molecular and physiological roles in vascular development, cell proliferation, and responses to phytohormones. <br/><br/>The researcher and her group have identified a plant-specific protein family that shares key structural and functional similarities with tetraspanins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one member of this family named VASCULAR COMPLEXITY AND CONECTIVITY (VCC) controls vascular development. VCC interacts with TETRASPANIN 1 (TET1) and other signaling molecules involved in vasculature development and localizes to the plasma membrane. The researcher proposes that tetraspanins, VCC proteins, and likely other membrane associated proteins act in a combinatorial manner to establish protein-network modules that contain different associations of receptors and signaling components specific to different plant cell types/tissues. In this context, the evolution of plant tetraspanin-like proteins like the VCC family could have potentially increased the diversity and specificity of protein signaling modules on membranes. This project will analyze two plant tetraspanin signaling modules involved in very different processes. One module is at the plasma membrane, consists of TET1, VCC, and the membrane-associated protein OCTOPUS (OPS), and positively regulates vascular differentiation in Arabidopsis embryos. The other module localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, contains TET6, and controls seed longevity, seed responses to abscisic acid and oxidative stress during germination. The goals are to identify what other structuring components (other tetraspanins, VCC, or other TET-like proteins) and signaling molecules (e.g. receptors) are part of these signaling modules, to determine what signaling/physiological events they control, and to explore the function and composition of other tetraspanins and VCC protein networks in Arabidopsis though genetic, proteomic, and molecular approaches. This project will provide interdisciplinary training to a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, and several undergraduate researchers enrolled in UW-Madison or attending its summer REU program through the Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program. The proposed research will also impact classroom education at the University of Wisconsin. The Principal Investigator teaches three hands-on undergraduate and graduate courses that require the completion of a research project in plant biology. In addition, thirty students taking the Introduction to Engineering Design course at the UW-Madison campus, will interact with the research team on this poroject and design a device specially optimized to facilitate the imaging of plant membrane proteins in intact Arabidopsis embryos and seedlings under controlled environmental conditions."

A recent surge of interest in acoustic communication in urban contexts highlights a potential adaptation of birds to life in many different cities. These studies have raised several fundamental questions regarding this potential adaptation, which have global applications to studies of animal communication and mate selection. This proposal will address three of these fundamental questions: (1) how are birds adjusting their song to the urban environment?; (2) how has song urbanization affected signal information?; and (3) are urban songs adaptive? To address these questions, this study will employ behavioral, ecological and mechanistic modeling approaches, using an established NSF model organism for behavioral studies, white-crowned sparrows. Meeting the proposal's objectives will transform the state of understanding of urban-dependent selection on mating behaviors and, more broadly, the adaptations of species that persist in urban environments. There are several aspects of the proposed study that should yield broad impacts: (1) broad dissemination of research results through community organizations, local and national museum displays, media outlets, and development of learner-centered teaching modules, (2) research opportunities for students from demographic groups that are under-represented in the sciences, (3) development of a statistical software package for simulating bird song evolution, and a workshop to train scientists, educators, and students in its use, and (4) collaboration and sharing of data with the National Park Service Sound Division, which will help national parks local to this study as well as national parks nationwide with their sound management plans."

An animal lives with trillions of microorganisms in its body, yet the implications of having most of these microorganisms are unknown. What is known thus far is focused primarily on the importance of microorganisms for digestion. However, current work suggests that an animal's microbes have effects that extend far beyond the gut, impacting the immune system and even stress. This project seeks to understand the importance of these microorganisms for health and survival in free-living populations of endangered iguanas that are exposed to changing and unnatural diets via ecotourism. The project will test how changing microbial communities and key physiological parameters relate to reproduction and survival in natural populations. Additionally, in the laboratory the researchers will experimentally test how changes in diet, stress, and microbes affect health and physiology in order to understand what is causing the observed changes in wild iguanas. Connecting physiological and microbial changes with animal population fluctuations in nature will be an innovative step forward. Finally, understanding both the occurrence and direction of these interactions will provide important insights into the effects of human-induced diet shifts on wildlife and much needed biological knowledge regarding threatened species.<br/><br/>Many recent studies have identified significant connections between the microbiome and host health in model systems. However, mechanistic links between the microbiome and physiological functions that are key to health and survival remain mostly unexplored. Furthermore, given that evolutionary history is one of the primary determinants of microbiome composition, the lack of taxonomic breadth severely restricts understanding of the physiological link between host habitat, diet, and immunity with microbiome composition and metagenomic function. There is also a paucity of research investigating microbial communities and health-related metrics within free-living animals. Thus, current knowledge of these relationships lacks critical ecological relevance and an understanding of the impact of environmental changes on endo-microbial communities. To address these current knowledge gaps, the project will study iguanas in both natural and captive settings, in order to test relationships among ecoimmune indices, anthropogenic-based diet changes, and the microbiome across a fragmented, insular landscape in The Bahamas. In the laboratory, the principal investigators will perform ecologically-relevant experimental manipulations in captive iguanas to test directional relationships in wild populations. The principal investigators will also investigate the stability of these associations over time in conjunction with a long-term mark recapture data set (37+ years) to estimate the influence of ecoimmunological, oxidative, and microbiome indices on reproductive output and survival across different populations exposed to variable human influence.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Division of Environmental Biology, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund within The Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, greater than 60% of all human infectious diseases have originated in animals, including West Nile virus and avian influenza virus, for which birds serve as the sources. A prominent knowledge gap in disease epidemiology is an understanding of the factors that influence variation in infectiousness of individuals. This project has four main objectives: (1) Test how variation in host body condition, through food restriction, affects how a bird responds to West Nile virus, using American robin (Turdus migratorius) as a focal species. (2) Use genome-wide technologies to investigate how gene expression mediates variation in viral shedding using low pathogenic avian influenza virus and two species of waterfowl, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teal (A. discors). (3) Develop simulation models that are parameterized with the data collected in experiments to investigate the effects of individual variation on pathogen dynamics at the population level. (4) Adapt the models to allow college, non-STEM students in general sciences to learn about disease dynamics.  Through a user-friendly computer interface students will be able to manipulate environmental stressors associated with climate change and/or other anthropogenic disturbances, and then track disease outcomes that are host and pathogen specific. Implementing a computer simulation exercise that illustrates concepts taught throughout the semester and allows students to answer relevant and thought-provoking questions will improve a student's learning experience in the large class environment. Overall this CAREER project will increase the understanding about the basis for variation in pathogen load and also which individuals may shed the highest pathogen loads (i.e. 'supershedders'), allowing development of more realistic epidemiological models that lead to cost-effective, targeted prevention and control strategies."

Plant cell walls are dynamic structures that play a pivotal role in growth and development, the maintenance of cell integrity and protection against pathogens. They are composed primarily of structural carbohydrates that can be broken down into sugars, providing energy directly as food/feed, or indirectly as biofuels. Thus, an improved understanding of how cell walls are assembled can lead to an increased food supply and renewable sources of fuels. Although the structure and synthesis of plant cell walls is generally understood, remarkably little is known about the transport mechanisms of polysaccharides and the cell wall biosynthesis machinery. This transport is mediated through a complex network of subcellular compartments called the endomembrane system. This project aims at identifying endomembrane trafficking pathways regulating the transport and deposition of cell wall components.  The project uses cell permeable small molecules that inhibit cell wall deposition. With the aid of these compounds, the targeted endomembrane pathways will be characterized and new components involved in these pathways will be identified. Multidisciplinary approaches including genetics, cell biology and biochemistry will add to our understanding of the processes that regulate wall deposition.  A number of student-scientists, including undergraduate students from underrepresented and financially disadvantaged ethnic groups will receive multidisciplinary research training in the project, thus enhancing the ethnic and cultural diversity of the scientific community. Selected chemical probes from the project will be used as live imaging teaching tools in an undergraduate laboratory course. Hands-on laboratory experience for regional life sciences educators will be provided, transferring excitement and state of the art knowledge across the educational system.

The ability of crop plants to fight off diseases is therefore a very important agricultural trait.  Farmers can avoid some diseases with pesticides, or breeders can develop crop varieties that resist diseases.  Crops have the ability to fight off diseases by reacting to the disease-causing microorganism with defensive mechanisms, known as the plant hypersensitive response (HR).   This refers to a process whereby an infected cell dies before the infection can spread to other cells in the plant.  Despite its importance to maintain healthy crops, much remains unknown about the HR.  In this work, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a number of field and lab-based techniques will be used to gain a better understanding of the HR in corn, the most economically valuable crop in the US.  The genes and processes involved in controlling the HR will be identified and characterized.  While this work will be performed primarily in corn, it is likely that many features of the HR are shared among different crops.  As such this work will provide fundamental insights into one of the most important ways plants defend themselves against diseases, and the knowledge will be useful to develop improved crop plants by making them more resistant to diseases. Outreach activities with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will focus on educational activities on genetics, plant breeding, biotechnology and associated societal implications and will build on an existing collaboration with the museum that has developed several instructional modules for middle, high school, home school and mature students and their teachers.  These continuing programs will be supported and several new programs will be developed around DNA sequence analysis, biotechnology and society.<br/><br/>In previous work, a novel genetic screen was used to identify loci, genes and pathways associated with natural genetic variation that controlled HR.

This is likely due to the occurrence of tradeoffs between stress resistance and overall growth/productivity, as well as the loss of genetic diversity during the domestication and breeding of crop plants. To combat stress-induced yield loss and improve food security, attention has turned to the development of stress-resistant crops, but such efforts require knowledge. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying abiotic stress resistance is thus needed to develop crops capable of feeding a rapidly growing population in the context of an increasingly variable climate, particularly as marginal lands are brought into production. The research conducted in this project will have important practical outcomes that will ultimately facilitate the production of more resilient crop plants. These outcomes include the production of actionable knowledge regarding the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying resistance to abiotic stresses that limit agricultural productivity, the identification of favorable genetic variants that can be moved from wild populations into downstream breeding programs, and the development and distribution of valuable germplasm resources. This project will also provide educational opportunities for students at multiple levels, and from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project involves a detailed investigation of the genomic and physiological basis of drought, salt, and low nutrient stress resistance in cultivated sunflower and its reproductively compatible, stress-adapted wild species that are potential donors of beneficial alleles. Sunflower is an ideal study system for this work because the productivity of cultivated sunflower is clearly limited by such stresses, while related wild species are adapted to life in a variety of extreme environments. The goals of this project are to: (1) assess resistance to drought, salt, and low nutrient stress and related traits in cultivated sunflower and its wild relatives using traditional and high-throughput phenotyping approaches; (2) associate variation in abiotic stress resistance and related traits in cultivated and wild sunflowers with specific genes, regulatory networks, and/or causal variants; (3) determine the mechanistic basis of stress resistance via in-depth physiological and transcriptomic characterization of genotypes with divergent stress responses; (4) identify suitable stress resistance alleles (i.e., those exhibiting resistance in multiple genetic backgrounds, ideally with minimal tradeoffs) for use in sunflower breeding programs; and (5) prepare students from diverse backgrounds for careers in the plants sciences. All germplasm resources will be made available via deposition in public repositories (e.g., USDA-GRIN) and the resulting data will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, public presentations, and deposition into relevant public databases including the sunflower genome database (http://www.sunflowergenome.org/), the HeliaGene sunflower database (http://www.heliagene.org/), GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/), the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and Dryad (http://datadryad.org/)."

This study utilizes existing data and archived biospecimens from a long-term field study of a gregarious mammal with a social structure permitting comparisons among status classes to assess effects of the early social environment on temperament and fitness. Effects of the early environment to be assessed include quality of maternal care, peer interactions and social status. Available data and specimens permit exploration of relationships among the early social environment, mechanisms of gene expression, circulating stress hormones, individual temperament, and longevity. The methods employed include high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing techniques, bioinformatics and advanced statistical methods. Broader impacts of this work include a deeper understanding of social and molecular determinants of adverse stress phenotypes. Ultimately, characterization of the early life social factors that shape adult stress phenotypes in free-living, gregarious mammals will facilitate generalization of the research findings to other social species, including our own. In addition to supporting the scientific work above, this project will facilitate a workshop series on research methods and data analysis designed specifically for members of the African Graduate Student Association at Michigan State University.<br/> <br/>Social experiences early in life have lasting effects on adult temperament and stress phenotype, often through epigenetic modification of genes, and thus patterns of gene expression, that coordinate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Using data from the MSU Mara Hyena Project, a 28-year study of free-living, gregarious hyenas in Kenya, this proposal will investigate how social factors relate to adverse stress phenotypes, and elucidate the extent to which this relationship is mediated by DNA methylation. Funding from this project will support two research goals. First, this proposal will use Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the hyena genome that are associated with high vs. low stress phenotypes based on assessment of adult hyena temperament and stress hormones, as well as differences in early social experiences including maternal rank, maternal care, and interactions with clan mates. DMRs that are predictive of the adult stress phenotypes will be identified using Mixed Model Association for Count data via data Augmentation. The second goal is to use mediation analysis to assess whether the identified socially-induced, stress-related epigenetic pathways mediate the effect of early experience on longevity. Findings from this work will improve mechanistic understanding of how social factors affect behavioral and physiological stress phenotypes in an important new animal model. Because a proximate epigenetic mechanism (DNA methylation) is assessed in relation to an ultimate consequence (fitness), this work represents a large step forward in terms of understanding the role of epigenetics in evolution - a concept that has been largely unexplored."

Contributing over $130 billion per year, tree crops are important to the US economy and are the economic backbone for many rural areas. Like all crops, they face increasing challenges from abiotic/biotic stresses including rapid climate change and disease. Providing access to high quality genotypic, phenotypic and environmental data and data-mining tools from a common, resource-efficient platform will enable interrogation of this data for basic and applied research purposes in ways currently not available. This project will create a model ""ecosystem"" of community databases that can inter-communicate, and provide big data analysis tools utilizing common controlled vocabularies. The significant investment in big data generation, cyberinfrastructure, and comprehensive semantic ontologies by federal agencies will be leveraged by this project to bring richly annotated datasets and enhanced computing capabilities to individual scientists. Adoption of these new capabilities will be promoted through educational online modules for ""guided"" workflow analysis and ontological curation that train scientists to effectively query existing data, upload new data, assign metadata, and perform custom analyses. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this project will accelerate both basic discovery and improvement of important agronomic and silvic traits in tree crops. In this way, it is the hope that this project will help raise public awareness of the critical importance of healthy trees to a productive, sustainable planet and the U.S. economy, and promote stewardship of these critical resources.  <br/><br/>Connecting high quality, curated, phenotypic and genotypic data with geo-location and environmental data will enable fundamental questions in tree biology to be elucidated. Providing access to these integrated datasets and the tools to interrogate them in a fully targeted manner, is best achieved through community databases where the crop curation expertise resides. The usage of standard ontologies, cross-site querying functionality and web-services driven interoperability with other database and resources will expand the utility of data from community databases in an unprecedented way.  Tripal is an open-source, customizable, scalable, modular database platform designed to address the constraints and resource inefficiencies of legacy database systems.

To address whether circuits in a given brain area are organized as functionally diverse and heterogeneous modules despite apparent anatomical similarity, the PI and his associates will investigate the mouse olfactory bulb -- a brain structure dedicated to processing smell. Image data charting patterns of gene expression throughout the bulb will be obtained from open, digitally curated atlases (the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)), and computationally mined to identify spatially structured motifs of gene expression. Electrophysiological recordings will also be made from slices of the bulb to directly test for the presence of organizational motifs identified in silico. These research activities will engage undergraduates extensively (the PI is a professor at a small liberal arts college), and provide them with experiences using computational approaches to study high-dimensional data sets. Additionally, the PI will promote the virtues of computational thinking and problem solving in biology through a redesign of his Introductory Neuroscience course.

A twin goal of the course redesign is to enhance diversity and retention in STEM disciplines through an emphasis on active, in-class learning. <br/><br/>Of the myriad genes whose differential expression might demarcate distinct brain subregions, one can typically only test a small and idiosyncratic set in a single experiment, potentially missing important contributors to regional heterogeneity.

We will cluster gene expression profiles obtained from the ABA's in-situ-hybridization experiments to identify candidate spatial modes (e.g. ""patchy"", ""periodic"", ""dorsomedial"") of expression in the bulb. Our subsequent aims are centered around the collection of a densely sampled electrophysiological map of olfactory bulb principal neurons using in-vitro whole-cell slice physiology. Each recorded cell will be spatially registered to the same virtual bulb, and represented as a high-dimensional feature vector of physiological properties; these data will be clustered as above to test for physiologically distinct subregions, as well as for correspondences between ""gene space"" and ""physiological space.""

Richard McCombie (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)<br/><br/>Improving nutrient use efficiency (NUE) in crop plants is critical to ameliorating the impacts of future climate change and to sustainably increasing global crop yields to meet projected food and energy demands. The NutriNet project seeks to identify and compare biologically connected gene networks whose collective expression patterns are predictive of phenotypic variation in NUE in Arabidopsis and maize.  This cross-species network inspired approach may be readily applied to many other economically important traits, and adapted to other crops. The advantages of the NutriNet approach include: i) exploiting detailed datasets for gene and protein interactions in Arabidopsis, to inform analysis of data poor crop species, and ii) identification of robust network modules that can be applied in molecular breeding programs. Proof-of-principle studies will demonstrate both conserved and species-specific features of network modules (but not necessarily candidate genes) regulating nitrogen assimilation and remobilization. The new knowledge generated in this project will consist of gene discovery, elucidation of regulatory circuits, and a better understanding of the molecular basis for nutrient physiology that drives crop productivity. As a practical deliverable, network-inspired molecular breeding tools will be developed that are expected to perform better than candidate gene approaches in selecting genotypes with improved NUE. The NutriNet team links expertise in systems biology, plant physiology, and crop genomics, to increase the fundamental understanding of crop utilization of nutrients.  The project offers multidisciplinary training to postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students in New York and Illinois. High school students will be introduced to systems biology through co-mentorship by biologists and computer scientists at NYU. In addition, because of the broad public interest in nutrient-efficient crops, the project team will engage audiences through outreach activities at the Illinois Corn Breeders' school to leverage the pioneering efforts and long history of the University of Illinois in concert with breeders to understand crop responses to nutrients and breeding for nitrogen utilization.<br/><br/>Recent advances in genome sequencing, functional genomics, and computational tools enable a systems level understanding of key physiological and developmental processes including NUE in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, translating this ""network knowledge"" from Arabidopsis to crops to potentially enhance agriculturally important phenotypes in crop species remains challenging. The goal of this project is to develop network-connected gene modules that can be used to predict the outcome of NUE in crops, by exploiting Arabidopsis network knowledge. The project approaches this goal by developing novel data sets and analytical methods as follows: 1) integrating phenotypic variation for NUE with new and existing data for nutrient-responsive gene expression profiles which allows for the development of a training set that exploits the power of genetic diversity from both Arabidopsis and maize; 2) using a split-root experimental design to identify evolutionarily conserved gene mechanisms that function in root-shoot N-signaling that may control root foraging for nutrients in the soil; 3) defining network modules predictive of NUE traits using a bioinformatics pipeline to combine Arabidopsis ""network knowledge"" with maize transcriptome data to generate NutriNet modules that will be validated using and tested for their ability to predict NUE based on gene expression; and, 4), using information derived from NutriNet modules to select individual genotypes that possess optimal NutriNet configurations from diverse germplasm pools which will then be evaluated for improved NUE traits in the lab (Arabidopsis) and field (maize). A comparative analysis of lab-to-field results will directly assess the ""translation"" of network knowledge from Arabidopsis to maize to serve as a general proof-of-principle, which can be applied to other networks and species.  All data and biological resources will be available upon request and accessible through long-term data and germplasm repositories."

As a direct result, there are now tens of thousands of publicly available data sets providing snapshots of how plants modulate the transcription of their genetic material to produce a phenotype. In order to appreciate the transcriptional complexity leading to phenotype, it is first necessary to understand the full composition of the transcriptome itself. Aside from protein-coding RNAs and small RNAs, a third class of transcript has recently been uncovered: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are emerging as key regulatory molecules impacting how plants respond to changes in their environment such as temperature and water abundance. Despite their many important roles, lncRNAs remain poorly annotated in plants. LncRNAs are difficult to predict from genomic sequence alone and often require extensive transcriptional information, and the capacity to process that data. To overcome difficulties in lncRNA annotation and functional classification, this project aims to mine all publicly available transcriptomic data for the fifteen most studied model and agriculturally significant plant species. LncRNAs will be identified, cross-species conservation will be determined, and putative functional pathways will be inferred in each of the fifteen species. These three data points (identification, conservation, and functional prediction) will not only provide a more holistic view of plant transcriptomes, but also help researchers studying the complex relationship between genome and phenome. This project initiates a novel bioinformatics and molecular biology training curriculum for undergraduates called LIVE for Plants, as well as a summer research component aimed at delivering an enhanced bioinformatic and molecular biology training to undergraduates. <br/><br/>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function in numerous developmental pathways in eukaryotes. In plants, lncRNAs are known for their roles in regulating responses to different environmental stimuli. The extent to which characterized plant lncRNAs represent the total suite of functional classes remains an open question. Moreover, the extent to which plant transcriptomes are composed of lncRNAs is also unknown, hindering discovery of new functional types. These gaps in knowledge are in part due to poor sampling in plants, as well as lack of a consistently applied methodology among identification efforts. This project aims to document and annotate lncRNA repertoires from fifteen angiosperms by mining > 100 terabases of publicly available RNA-seq data. This computational curation will entail identifying lncRNAs for each species and then annotating them based on expression, conservation, and predicted biological process. The bioinformatics workflow developed as part of this project will benefit other groups attempting similar large-scale curations in their own systems. All data and metadata will be disseminated through CyVerse's Data Store, with visualization provided by popular public resources such as EPIC-CoGe and BAR's eFP Browsers. Taken together, the project aims will yield an innovative resource of accessible and integrated information about plant lncRNAs, as well as the information and tools to identify lncRNAs with important biological functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New insights and resources of broad utility should ultimately contribute to controlling plant fertility in agriculture, particularly in the cereal crops. The project builds and improves on the varied and extensive outreach and education components of the PIs and their contributions via scientific leadership to continue a strong, positive impact on local and scientific communities, and on the next generation of scientists. Implementation of the ""Virtual Anther"" will make the project data widely accessible while helping students and the public understand how anthers develop.

All project outcomes will be accessible to the research community through a project website and long-term repositories such as GEO and MaizeGDB. All biological resources such as antibodies, clones and vectors will be available upon request. Seed will be deposited and distributed long-term through the Maize Genetics Cooperative. Software for the ""Virtual Anther"" will be made open-source and available via the Texas Advanced Computing Center website (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-software/).<br/><br/><br/>Male sterility is a common phenotype in natural species, functioning as one mechanism to promote outcrossing. Furthermore, control of pollen production by plant breeders is a fundamental technology that continues to underpin hybrid seed production in many crops. In the agricultural context, there is also a growing concern over climate disruption: both heat and cold cause male sterility in crop plants. This study seeks to more broadly understand the coordination of anther development and underlying cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, as plant cells switch from mitosis to meiosis.  The specific goals are to: (1) organize hierarchies of gene expression in individual anther cell types and (2) elucidate functions of small RNAs, particularly two unusual classes of ""phased"" secondary small RNAs (phasiRNAs) that are highly enriched in grass anthers. These phasiRNAs are processed from an extensive set of coordinately-expressed long non-coding RNA precursors into secondary small RNAs of 21 or 24 nucleotides. Using precisely staged maize anthers and laser microdissected cell types, the project will generate copious transcriptomic and proteomic data, organize transcriptional hierarchies of transcription factors, generate extensive data on small RNAs in a spatiotemporal context, and analyze the function and biogenesis of phasiRNAs. Genetic analysis using existing and engineered mutations will be used to test for essential roles of key transcription and phasiRNA biogenesis factors in anther development. Genetic and ""omics"" experiments will test new hypotheses about phasiRNA functions in anther cells and in meiosis. Most of the analysis will be conducted in maize because of its exquisite developmental regularity, the large size and ease of anther dissection, and existing molecular and genetic knowledge about maize anthers. Key insights will be evaluated in rice to distinguish general and species-specific points, with additional comparisons to other grasses. To generate new hypotheses, all data will be integrated into a ""Virtual Anther"" visualization system."

A major limitation to these programs is an understanding of how the genetic information affects the characteristics of plants that improve the amount of edible portions. Moreover, the predictive understanding is even less if the plants are placed in new, stressful environments like low rainfall or high temperature. A likely avenue of inquiry to improve breeding is to better connect how information stored in genes becomes traits of plants that combine their biology, such as photosynthetic rate or the amount of resources allocated to an edible root, with the physical world, such as the amount of water available or an excessive heat wave. These connections are currently often made in a way that requires new data collection for every new crop plant or environment such as a new soil, new temperature range or even a new improved line that shows variation in the amount of resources the plant allocates to an edible root. This continuous need for new information ultimately slows down the breeding program and the ability of plant scientists to quickly respond to the needs of society. This project will test a new approach that uses large amounts of data to calculate the probability that a particular plant characteristic will be displayed by a given plant line under various environmental conditions.  Specifically, the project will measure plant performance continuously by sending electrical pulses through plants, integrating the data generated with large data sets that show which genes are active as well as the level of biologically relevant molecules that contribute to major metabolic pathways within the plants at any given time. This new approach requires high performance computing to test many times how the probability of phenotypic improvement in the crop may occur. These high performance computing approaches will become a core part of a modern, competitive workforce.  In this regard, the project will provide workshops for high school teachers in the use of high performance yet open source computing tools in their classrooms. In addition, the project will develop experimental and computational modules in biological and quantitative learning for students in grades 6-12 using the highly successful Wisconsin FastPlants system (http://www.fastplants.org/).  <br/><br/>With increasing world populations, genetic advances to improve crop growth, yield and resistance to abiotic stress are a pressing need. Limiting the speed of crop improvement is a crucial knowledge gap regarding biophysical processes that modulate the relationship between the genome and phenome, hindering the ability to predict the phenotype of novel genotypes in novel environments. As a first step towards bridging this gap, a combination of high-throughput phenotyping and biophysical process modeling will incorporate allelic variation at key genes affecting plant carbon metabolism, hydraulics, and resource allocation, all of which are known to impact drought- and heat-stress resistance in plants. Variable selective pressures during crop diversification have caused extensive phenotypic variation among B. rapa crops, making it an excellent study system to both connect organ-level measures both down to the level of transcriptomic and metabolomic phenotypes and up to yield and to test predictive process models. Process models will be developed and refined using the mechanistic links that connect cell processes and ultimately whole plant physiology to regulatory intermediates such as metabolites and gene transcripts. If successful, the models developed will enable prediction of whole-plant stress-response phenotypes in heterogeneous genotypes and environments. The goals of the project are to: 1) deploy a novel high-throughput and real-time phenotyping method to measure diel physiological dynamics in eight B. rapa parental Nested Association Mapping (NAM) lines under drought- and heat-stress conditions; 2) predict yield in a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population of B. rapa using a biophysical process model of carbon metabolism, hydraulics and resource allocation to test systems-level links between circadian, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological QTL; and 3) test the predictive ability of the biophysical process model under heat- and drought-stress environments using the RIL population used in Aim 2.  All data and resources generated in this project will be made accessible to the public through long-term open access repositories such as Project Github and the NCBI Short Read Archive."

The revenue resulting from annual cotton production is estimated to be $100 billion in the USA alone. Cotton is an excellent model system for studying fiber cell differentiation, cell expansion, and cellulose biosynthesis, as well as polyploid genome evolution and crop domestication. Upland or American cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and Pima or Egyptian cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) have been independently domesticated from allotetraploid species. Improving cotton fiber yield and quality will provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based synthetic fibers. Generating a reference-grade genome sequence for domesticated allotetraploid cotton will enable both basic and applied research that will provide new insights into fiber development and cellulose and wall biosynthesis with broad impact for biomass crops and biofuel production. Since most crops are of polyploid origin, methods and principles being developed from this project will also advance research in other crops with complex and polyploid genomes. Genomic sequence and gene expression data will be made available through public data depositories, including GenBank, GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), miRBase (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/), and the NCBI's SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html).  Plant materials and the final version of annotated sequence will be distributed through CottonGen (http://www.cottongen.org/icgi/home), the cotton research community website. Innovative and scalable education and training modules in plant genomics and bioinformatics will be developed for middle and high schools and undergraduate institutions in the Mississippi Delta. The effectiveness of education and outreach will be enhanced through close collaborations with Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University, two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. <br/> <br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop high-quality sequence resources to address fundamental questions in crop plants that are of economic importance.  The physical map-guided hybrid approach in combination with whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is among the best strategies to sequence and assemble ""gold-standard"" reference-grade genomes of complex polyploid species including cotton and other important crops such as wheat.  The research team has developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resources including a physical map and BAC-end sequences (BES), WGS, PacBio long reads, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of Upland cotton (TM-1).  Moreover, the critical pilot data have been generated, which are necessary in preparing a successful strategy for sequencing the allotetraploid cotton.  Specifically, the project will sequence and assemble individual BAC inserts from the minimum tiling path that covers ~85% of the genome.  The gaps will be filled and/or reduced by the second iteration of additional 3,000 or more BACs with integration of WGS contigs, mate-pair and PacBio long reads.  The sequence contigs and scaffolds will be ordered by high-density linkage maps and BES-targeted GBS.  The final sequence will consist of thirteen pairs of homoeologous pseudo-molecules, including validation by targeted GBS and BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization.  The reference-grade sequence will be annotated by Phytozome with the RNA-seq data collected from ~20 cotton tissues.  This reference-grade sequence will be immediately released to the research and breeding communities to improve Upland cotton that accounts for >95% of the world cotton production.  The sequence will be utilized for analyzing epigenomes and their roles in fiber development of allotetraploid cotton."

They are microscopic animals that consist of just a few cells yet have a complex life cycle that typically alternates between infecting an annelid and a fish. Myxozoans are known to cause damage to fish aquaculture, which can have severe economical consequences, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying their ability to infect their hosts. Recent studies using DNA sequence data have provided evidence that myxozoans are related to cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and sea anemones).  Although superficially, these microscopic parasites do not bear any resemblance to cnidarians, they have a similar complex intracellular structure.  In myxozoans this structure is called a polar capsule and is used to attach to its host for infection.  The polar capsule bears a striking resemblance to the cnidarian stinging structure called a nematocyst. This project will generate whole genome and transcriptome data from several myxozoan species using next generation sequencing technologies.  This data will be deposited into the NCBI sequence read archive http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra.   The research will integrate newly generated genomic and ultrastructural data from myxozoan polar capsules with existing data on cnidarian nematocysts, in order to shed light on long standing questions regarding the origin and function of myxozoan polar capsules.  This will be accomplished by providing a comparative framework with which to study polar capsules in the context of what is known of nematocyst structure and function. <br/><br/>This project's collaboration combines expertise in myxozoan biology, cnidarian systematics, development, and genomics.

But how do young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species? Here, the researchers investigate the genomic, neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of species recognition employed by avian brood parasites, birds whose eggs are laid into nests of strangers and whose chicks are raised by the foster species. By identifying the password--a species-specific vocalization that attracts and initiates the neural mechanisms by which young brood parasites identify individuals of their own species--the researchers will be able to understand how young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species. This work will contribute broadly to scientific progress in the fields of learning and memory, behavioral plasticity and behavioral evolution. This research program involves training of students and young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of students, including many underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in integrative behavioral, neurobiological, and genomics research techniques. The participants will deliver public seminars and exhibits at Sylvan Heights Bird Park in North Carolina and at several non-profit organizations in New York City.<br/><br/>The suite of behavioral innovations underlying social parasitism, including avian brood parasitism, must include mechanisms to recognize conspecifics without prior exposure during early development. This project will tap into the developmental knowledge already gathered from parental songbirds, including the zebra finch model system, and focus the ontogenetic study on a closely-related, but obligate parasitic finch, the pin-tailed whydah. The aim is to test the general hypothesis that differences in neural architecture or processing between parasitic and parental birds reflect evolutionary tinkering, whereby novel traits arise by modification of existing networks and structures. Through experimentally manipulated exposure of juvenile parasites to songs, the prediction will be tested that conspecific recognition relies on hearing a salient species-specific character, termed the password. Detailed quantitative patterns of transcriptional change following password exposure, and throughout developmental landmarks, will be collected to identify neurogenomic signatures associated with the timing and induction of conspecific recognition and to more broadly define the molecular basis of experience-dependent or developmentally driven neuroplasticity. Critical acoustic and behavioral components of these data will be collected during a newly developed field course in Puerto Rico. Acoustic and video data will be made freely available through DataOne, a public data repository, and genomic data will be deposited into the National Institutes of Health's NCBI short read archive."

Increasingly variable spring weather works against the benefits to the farmer of planting early. This project is designed to identify naturally occurring variations in genes that make some corn plants more resistant to cold than others at this critical period in the life cycle. Genetic variants will be identified first using all-new imaging and computational tools being developed in the laboratory. By imaging and measuring plant responses to cold using computer-based methods, the project will access otherwise obscure information about how seeds take up water, germinate, emerge from the soil and grow under varying cold conditions. Molecular level differences will be identified using genomic methods that associate cold responses to genetic variants. Genetic hypotheses about these cold hardy candidates will then be tested in early-planted corn fields by comparing growth and yield in plants carrying different versions of the identified genetic elements. Undergraduate students from diverse institutions, including rural and urban locations, will be trained through direct participation at all levels of data generation and analysis. The critical role of students will result in a project with highly integrated research and education outcomes. For example, student-lead experiments will be conducted on educational corn field sites, further advancing student learning about scientific methods while at the same time providing critical research data. The project stands to make a positive impact on an important limitation to US agriculture by identifying the genetic basis of cold-resistance in corn and by training the next generation to apply the knowledge to real world situations.<br/><br/>The research plan integrates natural variation in diverse populations, advanced genomics techniques, and custom machine-vision methods to capture a systems-level understanding of the complex responses to cold stress. Populations will include recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines and doubled haploids, and includes parents of the Nested Association Mapping population and the Wisconsin Diversity Panel. Cold tolerant alleles in maize will be identified with genome wide association and QTL analyses, and hypotheses about the genetic architecture and inheritance patterns of cold response phenotypes will be rigorously tested. Aim 1 will refine machine vision methods for measuring germination phenotypes, while Aim 2 will focus on chilling stress during seedling growth.

The investigators have compelling data that suggest phototropins are components of the plant immune system. These data concern a protein from a plant pathogenic bacterium which the pathogen injects into plant cells to facilitate infection.

Plant biologists continue to discover exciting, novel roles for small RNAs during plant growth, development, and responses to the environment.  Like nearly all molecules in cells, the ability of small RNAs to carry out their functions depends on their location and quantity.  However, due to their small size, it has been particularly challenging to detect and locate small RNAs. In plants, current methods can only detect one, or at most, two small RNAs at a time. This project develops a new technique called qRNA-PAINT to detect, quantify, and localize tens to hundreds of small RNAs in a single sample, simultaneously. qRNA-PAINT makes it possible to examine the complex relationships of small RNAs inside of a plant cell with super-resolution precision.  Due to the wide-ranging role of small RNAs, this technique will have broad impacts on scientists seeking to answer fundamental biological questions in both plants and animals. Insights into the roles of small RNAs in plant signalling pathways may be translatable to increasing crop plant productivity and resistance to environmental stress and pathogens.<br/><br/>In the current age of genomics, there is a wealth of expression data for small RNAs.  However, methods to examine the subcellular, cellular, and even tissue level localization of small RNAs are limited. This has made it challenging to examine the relationship of different RNAs, such as miRNAs, siRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNA targets.  This proposal will fully develop the qRNA-PAINT method to examine the relationship of tens to hundreds of different small RNAs. qRNA-PAINT is a modification of the exchange points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (exchange-PAINT) method, which has been used to detect up to ten different protein targets.  It accomplishes this by using the stochastic binding of dye labeled imager oligonucleotides to docking strands attached to antibodies.  The qRNA-PAINT method does not use antibodies, but rather just locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes connected to the docking strands for exchange-PAINT.  Consequently, it potentially can be massively multiplexed for numerous small RNAs, to examine signaling networks in single cells and tissue types. The maize anther will be used as the model system and qRNA-PAINT data will complement the already available extensive set of sequencing data.  Furthermore, qRNA-PAINT will be combined with exchange-PAINT (for proteins) to examine the relative localization of protein machinery to study the biogenesis of different types of small RNAs. Ultimately, it will be used to answer outstanding questions on the spatio-temporal regulation of small RNA biogenesis and signaling networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its importance, cassava's current 12 to 24 month crop cycle limits the economic prosperity of smallholder farmers due to the length of time between harvest cycles.  Identifying new cassava varieties that bulk roots early in the crop cycle is an essential solution to overcome this time constraint. Selection for an early root bulking trait, however, is currently limited because it requires destructive digging of roots, unmanageable breeding trial sizes, and large labor costs. This project will improve trait selection by adapting a technology from geophysics called ground-penetrating radar to produce three-dimensional quantifiable images of cassava roots non-destructively.  Using ground-penetrating radar, early bulking root masses can be imaged underground. The goal is to select for cassava varieties that increase cassava yields by 25 to 50% by selecting early stage root bulking from existing high yielding genotypes.  The development of a commercial ground-penetrating radar instrument and associated data processing software for selecting early stage root bulking in cassava will provide cassava breeders throughout the world with the tools needed to develop new higher yielding cultivars.<br/><br/>Cassava is a tropical root crop that is exceptionally adapted to drought tolerance but has a prolonged life cycle of 12 to 24 months. This long duration limits harvest capabilities for smallholder farmers in the developing world, thus reducing the benefits of the crop as a component of global food security. Overcoming this limitation through selection of new cassava cultivars that exhibit early stage root bulking (ESRB) is an essential solution to ensure continued food security. This project will adapt ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to non-destructively develop 3-dimensional (3-D) quantifiable images of cassava roots. Current GPR instruments and analytical software are designed for subsurface imaging but not necessarily adapted for crop research. This project will use uncoupled GPR transmitters and antenna and an in vitro cassava trough assay system to develop an accurate and cost effective GPR instrument design for cassava breeding in terms of central frequencies emitted and antenna geometries.  Ancillary soil matrix data will be combined to allow the development of broadband GPR filter processes of root versus soil matrix specific frequencies, derive root allometries, and begin to convert the individual data processing methods into a streamlined decision support software for ESRB selection.  In the long term, the aim is to increase yield by 25 to 50% via GPR-based selection of ESRB from existing high yielding genotypes.  The project will ultimately develop an ideal GPR instrument and an easy to use streamlined data processing and decision support software needed by cassava breeders to develop higher yielding early bulking cassava cultivars."

However, mitochondria are not just any cellular component; they are the result of an ancient bacterial infection. They essentially are bacteria that permanently live in our cells; they have become part of us. Until just a few years ago, it was thought that the mitochondrion (and its partner structure in plants, the chloroplast) was unique in biology. Recent work has shown that many mitochondrion-like relationships exist in biology. Insects in particular have repeatedly developed relationships with bacteria that have taken up permanent residence in their cells. These bacteria show many similarities to mitochondria, particularly in reference to genome structure. The goal of this project is to use recent discoveries about the bacteria that live inside cicadas as a window into the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts and how they integrate with the cells in which they are found. . The work described in this project will use cutting-edge genomic experiments to accomplish these goals. This work is computationally intensive, and as such the educational component of this research will focus on teaching computer programming and its applications to Montana students at all levels. This work will have the important outcome of increasing the competitiveness of Montana students by giving them the computational tools they need to handle diverse, complex, and large sets of data. <br/><br/>Mitochondria originated only once in the history of life, a very long time ago, and the details of  their evolution remain obscure. Research into the mitochondria of diverse plants, animals, and single-celled organisms has revealed striking diversity in mitochondrial genome structure and size. Insects acquired bacterial endosymbionts much more recently than the origin of mitochondria, and so many of the features associated with the origin and establishment of the mitochondria are seen in insect endosymbionts but are less evolved. Recent work has shown that, like mitochondria, some insect endosymbionts have undergone extensive genome fragmentation and expansion. This research will use genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, molecular evolution, and field biology to provide insight into why some endosymbiotic genomes stay stable, while others diversify. This project includes activities that will teach University of Montana undergraduates and graduate students the fundamentals of computer programming using genomic data. The proposal will bring together students of biology that lack any computational background with students from the graphical arts for whom data visualization techniques are routine into a single course. These students will work collaboratively with each other to create new ways of visualizing massive genome data."

Most studies describe hybridization at the population level, rather than describing how hybridization affects individuals. Understanding how hybridization affects individuals will reveal the processes that determine whether genes from one species permanently mix with those of another, or whether this mixing is limited to one or a few generations. Using a wild population of baboons in southern Kenya, this research will provide a detailed description of how hybridization affects individuals. As such, it will be an important model for similar processes in many other organisms, including ancestral humans (who are known to have hybridized with Neanderthals and, before that, with other members of the human lineage). The research involves an international team with substantial participation by women and underrepresented minorities. The team will also contribute teaching modules for middle schools and conduct numerous public outreach activities discussing baboon behavior.<br/><br/>In the first five years of the LTREB project, the Principal Investigator measured the effects of hybridization on a suite of traits that could limit or enhance genetic introgression. The objective of this renewal is to expand this suite of traits, using methods or data that require the longer time horizon afforded by the LTREB mechanism. The specific aims are to (i) identify the sources of the admixture-by-sex interaction previously documented in the maturation schedules of wild baboons, (ii) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict male reproductive success, (iii) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict female reproductive performance, and (iv) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict female lifespan. The proposed work will produce an exceptionally detailed study of the effects of admixture on fitness-related traits in a naturally hybridizing mammal population, which in turn will help shape future hypotheses about mechanisms promoting or inhibiting genetic introgression during hybridization in other species. The data for this project will be stored on a web-accessible PostGreSQL database.

This will be accomplished in two ways. First, the research will derive new analysis methods that experimentalists can use to interpret neural data from naturalistic tasks of moderate complexity. Second, by the project will create a broadly applicable computational framework for synthesizing these analyses into a theory of probabilistic neural computation. Both of these components are informed by three basic principles: information in the brain is distributed across many neurons, sensory evidence is weighted by its reliability, and neural computation occurs in multiple stages. Current analyses that connect animal behavior to neural activities apply to tasks that are so simple that an animal would not actually need a brain to solve them: the same computations could be accomplished in a single step by wiring the sensory organs directly to the muscles. Clearly there is a need to study more complex tasks that require multi-step computations, and the proposed research will provide the rigorous statistical foundation needed to analyze data from such studies. The research will also have a broader educational impact by creating interactive teaching games that explain concepts needed for thinking about big neuroscience data.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research program is to explain brain function by constructing quantitative theories of how distributed nonlinear neural computation implements principles of statistical reasoning. To accomplish this goal, this project will create a normative theory for what information about naturalistic tasks should be encoded in neural populations, and data analyses that can reveal which aspects of that information are actually decoded. The normative theory is based on probabilistic population codes, a model in which large-scale neural activity patterns encode not just estimates of a stimulus, but also the reliability of those estimates. This model is currently applied only to small-scale inference problems, and one aim of this project is to extend this model by constructing biologically plausible network models for complex naturalistic tasks involving many interacting variables. The key components of this model, and indeed of any model of naturalistic computation, are nonlinear operations. To determine whether the posited nonlinear computations occur in a real brain, the other aim of the project is to derive a statistical analysis technique centered on a novel generalization of standard choice-related activity, termed nonlinear choice correlation. By combining this measure with estimates of neural correlations, experimentalists will be able to infer the class of distributed nonlinear computations the brain uses from simultaneous recording of neural activity and animal behavior."

Measurement of metabolic flux (the flow of matter through an organism's network of metabolic pathways) is a direct molecular indicator of an organism's phenotype. Metabolic flux information describes how nutrient resources and stores are used by which segments of a metabolic network to generate and accumulate products required for growth, development, and differentiation, integrated with responses to environmental conditions. Correspondingly, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) provides a direct route for both the discovery (and subsequent manipulation) of the molecular basis of any number of complex plant behaviors. Unfortunately, most MFA is currently performed using cultured cells, both to provide homogeneity and as an easy method for introduction of isotope labeled nutrients. Several challenges need to be addressed before dynamic-MFA can be applied practically to intact plants for molecular phenotyping.  This project will provide for 1) optimize methods for measurement of dynamic metabolic fluxes in intact plant systems using timed stable isotope labeled nutrient incorporation, mass spectral analysis, and automated data extraction and calculation of dynamic fluxes; 2) develop a procedure for finding additional connectivity and pathway components of metabolic network models using dynamic flux information using a publicly available metabolic network model for Arabidopsis with flux data collected from Arabidopsis plants subjected to multiple stress conditions and 3) develop microsampling approaches for dynamic flux analysis by examining crowding stress in maize. Computational and bioinformatics resources for metabolic flux analysis workflows will be created and distributed.<br/><br/><br/>In this project, postdoctoral scientists and graduate students will be exposed to a unique multidisciplinary approach to metabolomics.  In addition, the project will continue to offer a summer workshop for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and others interested in stable isotope approaches for understanding metabolic flux measurement and how it might be used for biological research. Short-term dissemination of data, processing algorithms and methods will be accomplished by means of the project website (http://plantmetabolomics.cfans.umn.edu/)."

Here, the researchers investigate the genomic, neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of species recognition employed by avian brood parasites, birds whose eggs are laid into nests of strangers and whose chicks are raised by the foster species. By identifying the password--a species-specific vocalization that attracts and initiates the neural mechanisms by which young brood parasites identify individuals of their own species--the researchers will be able to understand how young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species. This work will contribute broadly to scientific progress in the fields of learning and memory, behavioral plasticity and behavioral evolution. This research program involves training of students and young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of students, including many underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in integrative behavioral, neurobiological, and genomics research techniques. The participants will deliver public seminars and exhibits at Sylvan Heights Bird Park in North Carolina and at several non-profit organizations in New York City.<br/><br/>The suite of behavioral innovations underlying social parasitism, including avian brood parasitism, must include mechanisms to recognize conspecifics without prior exposure during early development. This project will tap into the developmental knowledge already gathered from parental songbirds, including the zebra finch model system, and focus the ontogenetic study on a closely-related, but obligate parasitic finch, the pin-tailed whydah. The aim is to test the general hypothesis that differences in neural architecture or processing between parasitic and parental birds reflect evolutionary tinkering, whereby novel traits arise by modification of existing networks and structures. Through experimentally manipulated exposure of juvenile parasites to songs, the prediction will be tested that conspecific recognition relies on hearing a salient species-specific character, termed the password. Detailed quantitative patterns of transcriptional change following password exposure, and throughout developmental landmarks, will be collected to identify neurogenomic signatures associated with the timing and induction of conspecific recognition and to more broadly define the molecular basis of experience-dependent or developmentally driven neuroplasticity. Critical acoustic and behavioral components of these data will be collected during a newly developed field course in Puerto Rico. Acoustic and video data will be made freely available through DataOne, a public data repository, and genomic data will be deposited into the National Institutes of Health's NCBI short read archive."

The global population is expected to increase to over 9 billion and food demand will grow by more than 50%.  Currently, there are 2 billion people worldwide living in poverty, mostly relying on subsistence agriculture in developing countries.  While poverty and food insecurity is a complex issue, the development of improved climate-resilient, high yielding and nutritious plant varieties is a critical part of improving food security, increasing income and economic welfare.  To address this challenge, innovative approaches are needed to speed up the development of improved plant varieties.  In plant breeding and genetics, precise measurements of plant characteristics are needed to accurately determine the effect of important genes and to identify and select the most promising candidate plant varieties.  There has been limited technology development in this area, particularly for traits measured in field trials where most measurements are still taken and recorded by hand.  This project will develop mobile applications (apps) for measuring plant traits that can be deployed on inexpensive and readily available mobile devices.  Initial testing and deployment through collaboration with cassava and wheat breeders will enable rapid dissemination and broad usability.  Middle-school and high-school students will also be engaged to test and use the apps to explore plant growth and measure plant traits.  Equipping thousands of plant breeders around the world with tools for rapid measurement and analysis of important plant traits will provide the foundation for accelerated development of improved plant varieties that will ultimately result in increased productivity, food security, nutrition and income of smallholder farmers and their families in developing countries. <br/><br/>Over the past decade, the availability of genomic data has exploded while the methods to collect phenotypes have made minimal advancements.  This has led to a dramatic imbalance in data sets connecting genotype to phenotype and highlights phenotyping as the remaining major bottleneck in plant breeding programs.  This project will advance the field of 3D graphics and modeling, data mining and deep learning through integration of simultaneous ground truth phenotypic measurements and imaging with mobile technology.  Building on the success of Field Book (www.wheatgenetics.org/field-book), user-friendly mobile apps for field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) will be developed and deployed.  This project will converge novel advances in image processing and machine vision to deliver mobile apps through established breeder networks.  Novel image analysis algorithms will be developed to model and extract plant phenotypes.  A robust development pipeline will be assisted by 1) real-time field testing through breeding collaborators around the world and 2) middle-school and high-school students using the apps to explore plant growth and quantitative differences under genetic control.  To ensure both immediate, broad deployment and functionality on a diverse set of crops, breeder networks for cassava and wheat will be engaged, providing a diverse set of target plant phenotypes, environments, breeding programs and working cultures. By combining data from research programs with ground truth breeder knowledge, this project will lay the foundation for collecting training sets that can subsequently be used to extract and quantify complex phenotypes using deep learning. Open-source apps for smartphones and tablets will consist of both software and documentation so that users will be able to understand how to use the apps. Apps will be distributed through online app stores (Windows Store, iTunes App Store, Google Play), through project websites, and via collaborative plant breeding networks. The resulting source code will be hosted in a public GitHub repository with a GNU General Public License (GPL) open-source license."

Some viruses do this by hijacking cellular processes (e.g. cell division cycle) to force cells into states where they grow more and produce more virus.  Recent work from the investigators' labs showed that a viral gene (SBF) hijacked and rewired the cell cycle of an ancestor of Fungi and replaced the ancestral regulator (E2F) without disrupting the function of the cell cycle regulatory network.  Some Fungi (e.g. Chytrids) have a hybrid network with both ancestral and virally-derived cell cycle genes, which reflects a transition state during the rewiring of the cell cycle.  Unfortunately, nothing is known about the Chytrid cell cycle.  This project will study the function and architecture of the hybrid cell cycle network in a Chytrid (Spizellomyces punctatus) using genomics. The proposed work is significant because it will provide new data to elucidate how a virus could be a driver of evolution by contributing new genes and regulatory elements into an essential and highly conserved cell cycle network. This project also integrates graduate and post-doctoral research with high school teaching to develop the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Part 2: technical<br/><br/>The hypothesis of this proposal is that the viral SBF initially gained cell cycle control by binding cis-regulatory sequences of E2F-responsive promoters, and thereby gained the ability to control the G1/S transition. Early SBF then became redundantly integrated into the ancestral G1/S regulatory network, allowing the dikaryotic ancestor of Fungi to lose the E2F transcription factor. The project will generate data to address the central hypothesis and its alternatives with two specific aims: (1) Characterize the evolution of the DNA-binding specificity of recombinant SBF and E2F in early-diverging Fungi using high-throughput in vitro assays; and (2) Measure gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor binding to promoters using genomic methods in cell cycle synchronized cultures of Spizellomyces punctatus. The in vitro data will identify overlapping and/or distinct DNA binding specificities and their conservation across early-diverging Fungi. The Spizellomyces data will identify cell cycle genes and elucidate the cis-regulatory architectures of SBF and E2F-regulated genes in an exemplary Chytrid that has both factors. Conservation of overlapping DNA-binding specificity of SBF and E2F across most early-diverging Fungi and redundant regulation of cell cycle genes in Spizellomyces would support the central hypotheses."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the Cornell University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael Scanlon.<br/><br/>One approach to promote food security in a fluctuating climate is to identify and develop climate-resilient crops.  Maize is an indispensable food source and industrial feedstock for much of the world.  Maize is susceptible to stress, such as heat, drought and flooding.  Ethylene is a key regulator of plant growth, development and stress response; however, neither the genetic control of ethylene growth response nor its natural variation are understood in maize. Knowledge of the genetic architecture of ethylene response will enable future engineering efforts on ethylene-mediated stress tolerance in the cereals.  Broader impacts include the formation of interactive programs to increase public genetic and genomic literacy.  The Fellow will teach core concepts in genetics and genomics to participants outside of STEM fields.  Participants, in turn, will interpret this into public art that communicates genetic principles. Training objectives for the Fellow include gaining proficiency in plant genomics, association mapping and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This research will evaluate the genomic architecture of ethylene growth response in maize.  The ethylene response is an important target for crop adaptation to climate. The Fellow will conduct genome wide association studies to investigate the allelic architecture of maize ethylene response, and will identify transcriptomic networks and chromatin signatures associated with ethylene treatment.  The proposed research has significant potential to discover key alleles and genomic regions in maize that underlie stress tolerance associated with ethylene.  This work will provide a foundation for future investigations on the underlying mechanisms of ethylene response in maize and in other economically vital cereals.  Research outcomes will be shared with the public and research community through conferences, in publications and by submissions to data repositories: phenotypic data to Panzea (http://www.panzea.org), raw sequence data to NCBI-SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), and gene expression data to NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (http://www.maizegdb.org), and qTeller (http://qteller.com)."

Seeds are usually produced in one of two types of vessels to facilitate this process.  A dry pod splits open at maturity to release the seeds, so they can be carried on the wind or, if they have hooks, they can stick to an animal.  In contrast, a fleshy fruit such as an apple or cucumber will be eaten by an animal, which will then disperse the seeds.  Fleshy fruits provide an important source of nutrition to all animals, including humans; a large part of the human diet and economy is based on fruits such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, squash, or avocados.  Many different groups of flowering plants underwent an evolutionary shift from producing a dry pod to a fleshy fruit, with important ecological and economic consequences.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the genetic mechanisms that determine if a plant will produce a dry pod or an edible, fleshy fruit.  The work focuses on the nightshade family, which includes pod-producing species such as desert tobacco and petunia, as well as fleshy-fruit-producing species such as tomato, eggplant, and pepper.  These experiments look at the role of a group of genes that appears to have undergone a change in function associated with the origin of fleshy fruit.  The results may identify specific genes or changes in genes that allow a species to make an edible, nutritious fruit, which could contribute to crop improvement or development.  This project also will form the basis of two botanical garden exhibits on fruit structure and diversity in the nightshade family, and will provide training for high school students and undergraduates from under-represented minorities, as well as for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher. <br/><br/>The MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL (FUL) plays a key role in the development of the Arabidopsis fruit by determining the patterns of cell differentiation that are required for the fruit to elongate and split open normally to release the seeds. FUL orthologs have also been shown to be required for proper ripening in some fleshy fruits, showing a conserved function in fruit development, but with a substantially different outcome.  Fruits in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) are ancestrally dry and dehiscent, but there was a shift to fleshy fruit with the origin of the Solanoideae clade.  The FUL gene clade has undergone duplications leading to four copies in some species, and the first part of this project will generate a gene tree using a combination of transcriptome and targeted PCR approaches to identify when duplications occurred. The data will also be used to determine whether different paralogous clades have undergone different modes of evolution (neutral, purifying, etc), which will be correlated with the functional data collected in the second part.  The second part uses CRISPR technology to compare the function of the four FUL paralogs in desert tobacco and tomato to determine how the function of each paralog changed during Solanaceae evolution.  Double and quadruple mutants will also be evaluated and transcriptomes generated to determine the effect of downregulation on downstream targets in both dry and fleshy fruit development.  The focus will be on early stages of development, prior to ripening and dehiscence, when defining characteristics such as pericarp thickness and cell type identity are specified.  The data will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms required to produce a fleshy fruit, and will elucidate the processes underlying a key evolutionary phenomenon, the shift from dry to fleshy fruit production.  All data will be publicly available upon publication through GenBank, Sol Genomics Network, and the Dryad repository.  Mutant lines and seed will be available upon request from the investigators."

During the same time period, DNA sequencing has become thousands of times faster and cheaper, which has been the main driver of this flood of new genomes. Despite its efficiency, the new technology has significant limitations, one of which is that only a short stretch of DNA, a few hundred bases in length, can be sequenced at a time. These ""reads"" then need to be assembled together to reconstruct a genome, which might contain billions of bases spread across dozens of chromosomes. One consequence is that most genomes today, except for a very tiny number of intensively-studied model organisms, exist in highly fragmented form, often comprising tens of thousands of fragments. The vast majority of plant and animal species have remained in this ""draft"" format ever since their initial publication. This project will create new genome assembly software that will make it possible for scientists to use new sequencing technology to fix these draft genomes, not only correcting errors but also stitching together many of the small fragments to create much better assemblies for a very broad range of species. These improved genomes will, in turn, provide the foundation for more accurate gene catalogs, better analyses of genome structure and evolution, and a deeper understanding of the biology of genomes.<br/><br/>Genome assembly has long been an extremely challenging computational task, due to the complex repetitive nature of many genomes and to the large scale of the data generated in a sequencing effort. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically expanded the scale of the assembly problem, with raw data sets increasing from millions of reads in the mid-2000s to billions of reads in recent years. The recent introduction of very-long-read technologies with high error rates has made assembly even more challenging, but the great length of these sequences offers the possibility of much more contiguous assemblies. This project aims to develop new technology for genome assembly and to improve the genomes of a broad range of plant species that are used by scientists across many fields of research. The investigators will pursue these improvements through two related aims. First, they will develop new and improved assembly algorithms that combine Illumina sequences with third-generation sequencing technologies from Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences, and others. The new algorithms will allow investigators to combine low-cost short reads with higher-cost, high-error long reads to produce dramatically better genome assemblies. Second, they will develop a new algorithm to construct an assembly using the existing genome of a closely related species, without the need to generate new data. The investigators will demonstrate their methods by re-assembling multiple plant genomes from publicly available data. All assemblies will be released rapidly to the community, and all software will be free and open source.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important first step towards robust agricultural systems is to develop a deep understanding of the genetic control of yield. In barley, yield is determined by many components and the ability to increase yield through standard breeding approaches has slowed. The primary goal of this ERA-CAPS project is to identify genes that control yield-related traits in the small grain temperate cereal crop barley, and to begin to understand how they contribute to this complex phenotype. The three partners in this project will separately focus on seed, spike (inflorescence) and tiller (seed bearing stem) traits. The project will benefit from bringing together a collection of genetic resources and expertise from the three partners. Long-term community integration will be assured by sharing the resources, tools and information with the broader barley genetics and breeding community and by training the next generation of molecular breeders and scientists.<br/><br/>In barley, yield is determined by many components and the ability to increase yield through standard breeding approaches has slowed. Barley grain yield is impacted by three components including: seed (size and number), spike (inflorescence) and tillers (vegetative branches). The overall goal of this ERA-CAPS funded project is to identify genes that control morphological and developmental components of yield in barley, and to begin to understand how they contribute to this complex phenotype. The research leverages a previously exome captured sequenced germplasm panel, which will be phenotyped for yield-related traits. These data will provide the opportunity to gain an increased understanding of GxE interactions for key traits. The team will conduct transcriptome sequencing of six trait-related tissues per genotype and analyze how gene expression relates to trait development. To enable accurate quantification of transcript read depth, a reference transcript dataset will be developed by using deep paired-end Illumina RNA-seq and PacBio ISO-seq data from six tissues from cv. Morex. This will be used to quantify transcript abundance from RNA-seq data collected from the same six tissues sampled across the population. RNA-seq derived SNP alleles will supplement the exome capture SNPs and both SNP datasets and transcript read depth variation will be used for association analysis with yield-related traits. Gene co-expression networks will be constructed using reference transcript dataset from Morex and RNA-seq data from the six tissues sampled from the germplasm panel. Both datasets will be integrated to identify candidate genes or key regulators of yield related traits. Functional characterization of candidate genes will be initiated by identifying deleterious alleles from TILLING populations available in each of the three partner labs. The project will provide global community resources of broad impact including: a reference transcript dataset, additional SNPs derived from the landrace collection, and gene co-expression networks for exploring key regulatory genes and their relationship to yield-related traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most evident symptom and important consequence of Al toxicity is root growth inhibition on acidic soils. A prominent example is barley, which is one of the most important crops in temperate regions including Europe and North America. Barley is very sensitive to Al toxicity and yield losses of up to 30% have been associated with growth in acidic soils. It has been previously argued that Al toxicity was an intractable problem due to its apparent complexity. The goal of this project is to define the biochemical mechanism that underlies inhibition of root growth in Arabidopsis and barley following chronic exposure to Al. It is the expectation that an inclusive understanding of this novel process will enable the development of agricultural crop plants that can grow and thrive in the presence of Al. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide research training opportunities for a diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students from a range of ethnic and social backgrounds. Student training will be enhanced by international research exchanges and collaborations with colleagues from Belgium, Germany and Poland who lead the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled ""Towards a molecular understanding of aluminium genotoxicity for crop improvement (Al-UCIDATE)"". Finally, the project will provide a summer research training internship for a local high school teacher from a local school district that serves a significant Hispanic student population.<br/> <br/>Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. When found in acidic environments, Al converts to the highly toxic Al3+ form. While the mechanisms of Al exclusion from plants are relatively simple, little is known about the biochemical basis of Al toxicity and why Al leads to severe root growth inhibition with profound effects on yield. Recent work in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that Al may act as a genotoxic agent, with DNA damage caused by Al triggering a cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is regulated largely by the cell cycle checkpoint factor Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR).  Specifically, mutations in ATR appear to confer substantial Al tolerance to the plant by suppressing cell cycle progression which forces terminal differentiation of the root in response to Al. The finding that Al acts as a DNA-stress inducing compound represents a new perspective on Al toxicity that bears further investigation. The goal of this project is to study this novel effect of Al on root growth in barley and Arabidopsis using a combination of transcriptomic, phylogenetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses. By developing a model by which root growth is halted following chronic exposure to Al, it is anticipated that the information will enable the exploitation of checkpoint control to confer Al tolerance to economically important crop plants. All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible. Genome, sequence, and proteome datasets will be accessible through a consortium website and through publicly available data repositories that include ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) and the PRIDE Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) for proteomics data.

This hypothesis will be tested in several species by a number of techniques. Both light and electron microscopy will be used to quantify cell-specific features involved in transport, including the channels (plasmodesmata) that connect the phloem to surrounding cells. Cell-specific promoters (the DNA elements that control gene expression) will be used to identify cell types within veins and this information will be used in conjunction with microscopy to profile gene expression patterns in the different cell types. In a third project, specific phloem cells will be selectively killed with a toxin synthesized under the control of cell-specific promoters and these plants will be used to obtain and characterize phloem sap to identify nutrients, macromolecules and defense compounds transported in individual cell types. In terms of broader impacts, specific cells involved in the synthesis and transport of compounds required for the proper development and health of crop plants will be identified.

Tomato production in the US and worldwide is threatened by two devastating insect-transmitted viruses - tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Management of these viruses is difficult and often relies heavily on the use of insecticides to control the vectors. Insecticidal control is often ineffective, has negative human health and environmental effects, and can lead to selection of insecticide-resistant forms of the vectors. In tomato, the Ty1 locus for TYLCV and the Sw5 locus for TSWV are major genetic resistance sources, and both have been introgressed into commercial tomato varieties. However, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in Ty1- and Sw5-mediated resistance. This project will provide new insights into the nature of and interplay between mechanisms of plant resistance and susceptibility to infection by insect-transmitted viruses. These studies will provide insights into whether similar or different pathways are targeted by RNA (TSWV) versus DNA (TYLCV) viruses during infection and/or host defense. The project will then use the results from these studies to optimize and validate a new approach called miRNA-induced gene silencing (MIGS) that can be used to assess gene function in tomato.  If successful, the outcomes of this project will likely lead to a new generation of antiviral strategies against these viruses. The project will also provide a 10-week training program every year for undergraduate students from Sacramento City College and high school students from Davis Senior High School.<br/><br/>The genetic resistance mediated by Sw5 and Ty1 loci introgressed from wild tomato relatives into cultivated tomato provides the best source of protection against TSWV and TYLCV, respectively. The investigators of this project hypothesize that Sw5- and Ty1-mediated recognition of TSWV and TYLCV trigger early and discernable transcriptional changes that involve common and specific immune signaling networks. In addition, infection of these viruses on susceptible tomato genotypes induces transcriptional changes that promote virus virulence. To gain insights into the transcriptional changes, the investigators will use RNAseq approach to identify differentially expressed transcripts during TSWV and TYLCV resistance and susceptible responses in tomato. Computational methods will be used to analyze RNASeq data to identify key common and specific genes that are differentially regulated during TSWV and TYLCV resistance and susceptible interaction. The project will optimize and validate the MIGS approach for gene function studies in transgenic tomato by targeting known candidate genes. The optimized MIGS approach will be used to evaluate function of selected differentially expressed genes during TYLCV and TSWV resistance and susceptible interactions in tomato. Results from the project will likely provide insights into designing new generation of strategies to control not only TYLCV and TSWV but also other important plant pathogens. All data and biological resources will be accessible to the public. All RNAseq data will be deposited and available through GEO.

The path towards achieving this goal is being revolutionized by genetic techniques that allow for manipulation of the activity of neurons and measurement of the effect on behavior. Flight behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila, is highly suitable for this combined analysis, since flies can be genetically manipulated very easily and their rich set of free flight behaviors can be quantitatively characterized in great detail. This project will use this approach to unravel the design and operation of a remarkable neural circuit responsible for giving flies one of the fastest response times in the animal kingdom and controlling their high speed maneuvering capabilities. Using small magnets attached to the flies and applied magnetic fields, flies will be subjected to forces in midair that alter their flight. By turning on and off the neurons in the control circuit that governs their response to such forces and determining the resulting change in their wing motions, the role that each individual neuron plays in the neural circuit that governs the recovery of these insects to the experimental perturbation will be determined. More broadly this work will lay the framework for a general powerful approach for interrogating and building an understanding of many other complex neural circuits. Moreover, the discoveries made will inform design principles for the development of efficient control strategies that can be used in robots. This pipeline for discovery will be publicized through conference meetings, publications, and workshops. In addition, the analysis routines and resulting data will be made available through the Principal Investigator's group web site.  <br/><br/>The flight of fruit flies (Drosophila) provides a rich set of free flight behaviors that can be quantitatively characterized in great detail using methods recently developed by the PI. Towards this end, this project will develop a platform in which each neuron in this circuit can be manipulated using optogenetics and the altered behavioral response quantified, with the aim of dissecting with unprecedented detail a behaviorally vital yet poorly understood neural circuit. Crucially, the approach taken entails using large empirical data sets of flight kinematics in conjunction with the mathematical theory of dynamical systems to generate reduced order models. These models will be used to guide the experiment design and interpretation of the resulting kinematic data. Application of this approach to motor-neurons will be used to elucidate the role of specific steering muscles in the flight control process. Application of this approach to the inter-neurons, which relay sensory responses to the motor-neurons, is being used to elucidate the design and function of the neural control circuit that determines the fly's response to mid-air perturbations.  More broadly the complexity and hierarchical layout of the machinery necessary for insect flight is typical of other complex neural circuits."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to David Mitchell is ""A Genome-wide Investigation of Light Intensity Effects on the Maize RNA Structurome"". The host institution for the fellowship is the Pennsylvania State University and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Philip C. Bevilacqua and Dr. Sarah M. Assmann.<br/><br/>As maize is a vital food and fuel crop, efforts have been made to increase maize yields by increasing planting density. Dense planting increases the canopy cover and blocks sunlight from reaching the lower leaves, thus stimulating shade avoidance responses which limits crop yield. Information obtained from this research can contribute to genetic engineering of maize to improve yield under high planting densities. Powerful tools used and developed in this research will revolutionize how RNA structure and function are studied. Through this project, the researcher will gain novel expertise in plant biology techniques and in computational and bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, for six weeks annually underrepresented high school students will be mentored in laboratory research projects.<br/><br/>This research will adapt Structure-seq to maize to perform high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo investigation of gene expression, RNA secondary structures, and RNA-protein interactions in response to low-light stress. By applying new structure-probing chemical reagents that allow Structure-seq to probe all four RNA bases, this research will better enable Structure-seq to distinguish RNA-RNA from RNA-protein interactions. It will examine the use of in vivo crosslinking via photoactivatable nucleoside analogues to provide direct proximity information on these interactions. Furthermore, it will modify the Structure-seq RNA structure prediction algorithm to incorporate constraints from proximity information, sequence complementarity, and known protein binding motifs. Data generated from this research will be uploaded upon processing to the appropriate community databases, including the NCBI Sequence Reads archive (SRA) for RNA structure data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and GEO for RNA-seq data (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)."

These experience-dependent changes in the function of brain circuits contribute to many fundamental processes including development, learning, and memory. Long-term changes in the organization of the nervous system in response to experience depend in part on the set of genes expressed in neurons. However, the nervous system is made up of many different types of neurons. Whether changes in gene expression in response to experience are similar across different types of neurons or whether each type responds in its own way is not well understood. Furthermore, whether different types of experiences cause the same gene expression changes in a particular type of neuron is also not clear.  This project will leverage several new developments to analyze the gene expression changes induced in single, identified neurons by changes in experience to address these questions. In addition, as the investigators develop and use powerful new techniques to address these questions at the resolution of single neurons, they will generate materials to train other scientists and students to analyze these types of data so that these techniques can be applied to other important biological questions. The results from these studies are expected to advance our knowledge of how the nervous system implements long term changes induced by experience to affect such fundamental processes as development, learning and memory.<br/><br/>Experience-dependent plasticity underlies many fundamental processes in the nervous system including development, learning, and memory. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. Even less understood is the heterogeneity of cellular responses to induction of plasticity. This proposal addresses two fundamental questions: 1) Do different classes of cortical projection neuron engage similar plasticity mechanisms or exhibit cell type-specific transcriptional responses to experience-dependent plasticity? and 2) Does experience-dependent plasticity evoked by different sensory modalities engage similar molecular mechanisms or exhibit modality-specific transcriptional responses? Using single cell RNA-sequencing, the investigators will analyze the transcriptional profiles of distinct neuronal types within sensory cortex and identify common and cell type-specific molecular changes induced by well-established paradigms of experience-dependent plasticity.  In addition, the investigators will develop a publicly accessible, interactive website to rapidly disseminate the gene expression data generated by the project to the broader scientific community, to educate scientists and other interested students in approaches for analyzing and interpreting these types of data in this rapidly developing field, and to share new analytical tools developed during the project.  Together, these studies will generate mechanistic insights into the heterogeneity of the transcriptional responses to experience-dependent plasticity."

Paradoxically, however, polyandry (i.e., mating with multiple males) is ubiquitous among animals of all types.  Longterm research with prairie dogs has revealed that reproductive success (RS) is higher for polyandrous females than for monandrous females. To investigate the costs and benefits of polyandry, researchers from The University of Maryland will perform a manipulative field experiment that will compare monandry versus polyandry for female prairie dogs matched for age, body mass, colony size, and the adult sex ratio. This comprehensive experiment will be the most detailed examination of polyandry to date for a mammal living under natural conditions. The researchers will use two innovations, ultrasounds and remote-controlled serpentine robots (snakebots), to count offspring at previously un-observable portions of the life-history. Further, they will capitalize on a powerful combination of behavioral observations of matings with molecular analyses of paternity to investigate genetic mechanisms by which polyandry might enhance female RS.  This longterm research of polyandry under natural conditions will have sweeping consequences for our understanding of several key issues in Animal Behavior, including mate choice, generation and maintenance of genetic diversity, sexual selection, and population viability. Broader impacts include training 8 undergraduates per year, many of whom will be under-represented minorities; a Critter-Cam, which will enable amateur and professional biologists to view live interactions among marked prairie dogs; assistance to 5 organizations working to conserve prairie dogs; lectures to pre-K through high school students; 2 websites with information about prairie dogs; and frequent radio and television shows about prairie dogs. <br/><br/>Data Management<br/><br/>Behavioral and genetic data will be stored and available to the general public in databases such as the DRYAD data repository (http://datadryad.org/) and NCBI Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)."

The results of this work will improve the understanding of how ploidal level may influence species' responses to environmental change.

The proposed study will fill this gap by revealing inter-neuronal interactions in the cortical circuitry for control of visually guided locomotion. Thereby it will make a critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of the cortical mechanisms underlying complex everyday movements. Accomplishing the aims of this project will constitute a substantial advancement in mammalian motor neurophysiology and will have direct impact on and can be transformative for understanding the basic principles of how vision is used to adapt movements. In addition, data from this project will be added to open databases of brain structure and function to further facilitate research of the brain. This will ultimately lead to a better understanding of neurological disorders affecting vision and movements and development of new treatments for them. The project will also have an educational impact by providing students at various levels an opportunity to participate in research. <br/><br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to understand the motor, premotor, and parietal cortex mechanisms that are involved in adaptation of locomotion to the visually perceived features of complex natural environments. Experimental data will be obtained from cats, which are classic subjects for research in both motor and visual systems. Cats will walk on a flat surface where no visuo-motor coordination will be required and along a horizontal ladder where visuo-motor coordination for accurate foot placement on the cross-pieces will be required. Visual information will be made available to cats at different phases of the approach. The activity of neurons in the motor, premotor, and parietal cortex will be recorded. Axonal projections of the neurons will be identified. Optogenetic tools will be then used to reversibly block or activate various inputs to the neurons in order to understand the contribution that these inputs make to the formation of cortico-spinal signals for control of visually guided stepping. There are two interlocking objectives. Objective 1 is to reveal the role of projection from posterior parietal area 5 to premotor cortex in modulation of its descending signals during simple and visually-guided locomotion. Objective 2 is to reveal the role of projection from premotor area 6 to motor cortex in modulation of motor cortical signals to the spinal cord during simple and visually-guided locomotion. Results will provide novel insights into the basic neural principles of perception to action conversion during the defining function of animals, locomotion."

A chemical in the brain called dopamine is well known to promote advantageous behavior when animals are pursuing reward; however, little is known regarding the role of dopamine when animals are avoiding harm. The principal investigator's lab is able to measure real-time dopamine levels in the brain of behaving animals using a tool called voltammetry, and turn dopamine neurons on/off using a tool called optogenetics. Using these tools, the investigator's research team will perform a thorough assessment of how dopamine levels within the brains of behaving rats are involved in the avoidance of footshock. Additional experiments serve to determine whether dopamine is involved in assessing the value of avoiding different intensities of footshock. It is predicted that dopamine levels will change over the course of learning in a manner that promotes successful footshock avoidance and scale with the value of the footshock avoided. All aspects of the proposed project will involve undergraduate trainees, especially trainees from underrepresented populations. By using cutting-edge technologies to investigate the role of dopamine in the avoidance of harm, the principal investigator and his students will uncover novel information about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavior while simultaneously developing a future, diverse population of scientists.<br/><br/>The principal investigator recently demonstrated that a warning signal predicting the avoidance of an aversive event evokes transient surges in dopamine concentration within the ventral striatum. This finding suggests that the transient dopamine signal represents environmental stimuli predicting the avoidance of something bad similarly to those predicting the receipt of something good. Furthermore, preliminary optogenetics data reveal that facilitating midbrain dopamine neural activity during warning signal presentation promotes avoidance outcomes in well-trained rats. Despite these important advances, the precise role(s) that transient dopamine release events play in negative reinforcement processes remains unknown. In this project, the investigator and his research team will use fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics to assess the role of transient dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens core, dorsomedial striatum, and dorsolateral striatum during: 1) avoidance learning, 2) maintenance and extinction of avoidance, and 3) positive vs. negative reinforcement value assessment. The collection of these data will generate presently unknown mechanistic detail regarding how the brain processes negative reinforcement-- information that may contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of dopamine in animal behavior. To accomplish these goals, the investigator will involve undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, in all aspects of data collection and dissemination. In addition, the investigator will develop an international neuroscience conference experience program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities and a neuroscience outreach program in which undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities visit Denver city museums and schools to teach the general public about the brain."

Information about growth and development is encoded in a plant's DNA, which has four fundamental chemical components, often referred to as A, C, G and T. However, the C can also be modified by a process called methylation, which allows it to function as a 5th information component in DNA. While it is apparent that methylated Cs play an important role in plant growth and development, their role has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal, the number and pattern of methylated Cs among different crop plants will be compared, including barley, einkorn wheat and sorghum. These comparisons will be used to investigate the influence of methylated Cs on the function of genes. The overall goal is to better understand the contribution of methylated Cs to plant growth and development, so that eventually this information can be used for crop improvement.<br/><br/>DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications that are crucial to plant genome function. Recent work has also shown that methylation has broad consequences for genome evolution, including the composition of intergenic DNA, as a fundamental evolutionary property of specific genes, and as a driver of compositional biases among genomic regions. Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, a thorough understanding of the evolution and function of plant genomes requires characterization of epigenetic variation among plant species. Yet, such a characterization is presently lacking. This project will generate and analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) and transcript (RNAseq) data for an array of grass species. The data will be released to the Short Read Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus databases prior to publication. The goal is to use the data to better understand the relationship among DNA methylation, gene evolution and gene function, as measured by gene expression. To achieve this end, a series of unique evolutionary analyses will be developed that will address three specific hypotheses: 1) that gene-body methylation is a conserved feature of functionally important genes and maintained over evolutionary time by natural selection; 2) that evolutionary shifts in gene body methylation (and/or the methylation of flanking regions) drive shifts in gene expression between species; and 3) that DNA methylation variation among tissues - specifically in genes and flanking regions - contributes to tissue-specific gene expression."

By combining approaches similar to those used in the Human Genome project, the researchers will identify alleles, special variations in these ""vitamin"" genes, and learn how to put them together to generate high amounts of vitamins in corn kernels.  An important outcome of this research will be the knowledge by which to enhance these micronutrient levels in corn kernels such that diets in which maize is a major component provide a balanced nutritional content.

Years of selective breeding have produced the modern tomato, and yet the quality and production efficiency of the crop still needs improvement. Despite this need, desirable traits that will improve fruit quality are often hard to find, partly because the underlying factors that specify fruit traits are not fully known. Another impediment is that some beneficial traits were eliminated or hidden during breeding, thus reducing the available genetic diversity in modern tomato genomes. Project scientists have discovered an untapped resource to find new traits from wild tomato relatives and from ancestral populations growing in diverse geographic locations. These plants may appear undesirable by having small, seedy, soft or unpalatable fruits. However, these relatives are actually genetic gold mines: they hold within their DNA useful and untapped traits that were lost during tomato domestication. New technologies and genetic methods are now available to mine these wild tomato genomes for new suites of breeding traits. This project uses the selected wild populations to explore and capture quality traits associated with fruit weight, firmness, flavor and color. The project will identify the molecular basis of these fruit traits and will deliver new traits to improve the breeding potential of the modern tomato. The project provides interdisciplinary training in genomics, computational data analysis and breeding to all involved, including post-doctoral researchers and graduate students. Through summer workshops, high school and college students will be trained in tomato genomics and breeding, will interact directly with scientists, and will gain hands-on skills in research. These trained students will be critical additions to a workforce that advances agriculture through scientific discovery. <br/><br/>Wild relatives and semi-domesticated germplasm of cultivated plants provide a significant reservoir of genetic and epigenetic diversity for key regulators of agronomic traits. Future crop improvement relies on harnessing this diversity. However, mining semi-domesticated and wild germplasm for beneficial alleles of agriculturally important traits is not straightforward because fruit quality is quantitatively inherited. Consequently, visual inspection of unselected germplasm does not readily lead to the identification of accessions that have desirable characteristics to improve modern germplasm. The association of traits with genes controlling fruit quality and the identification of beneficial alleles that may have been lost during domestication should provide a model for studying how to efficiently mine germplasm of the closest wild relatives for quantitative trait loci leading to tangible crop improvement. To identify genes and pathways that control complex tomato fruit quality traits, this project will (1) assemble and phenotype a tomato population (Solanum spp.) constituting the continuum of wild, semi-domesticated and ancestral landraces; (2) identify loci underlying fruit quality traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differentially expressed small RNAs; (3) confirm genetically the traits associated with candidate regions to genes, and (4) analyze the developmental and biochemical pathways that control fruit quality. The project will result in genome sequence data for 150 tomato accessions, including 20 from the closest but fully wild relative of cultivated tomato, 110 from wild and semi-domesticated direct ancestors of domesticated tomatoes and 20 from the earliest landraces of cultivated tomatoes. In addition, the project will generate small RNA sequence data from different stages of tomato fruit development from a subset of this population, and will provide detailed fruit quality information about flavor, firmness, weight and palatability for each of the 150 accessions. The information will be available through a public resource, the Sol Genomic Network (SGN, http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/), and seeds of the accessions will be available from germplasm repository sites (TGRC, http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/; and COMAV, http://www.comav.upv.es/)."

How growing plants create flower shapes is unknown. Understanding how flowers acquire shape is important flowers are major sources of human food.  Earlier work has shown that the shape that flowers take depends on the expression of regulatory genes in the growing flowers, and on the mechanical properties of the walls of the floral cells.  This project will create computer models of flowers that show all of the cells and cell walls at several stages of floral growth and add to those models the physical properties of the walls (measured by several biophysical methods) and the patterns of gene expression that create the cell walls and regulate floral shape.  By comparing these patterns, the team will develop hypotheses about how the combination of changing gene expression and changing mechanical properties lead to changes in cell shape and size, and therefore to the development of flower shape. They will test the hypotheses and the models by changing wall mechanical properties experimentally and seeing if the computer model predicts the shape changes seen in the experiments. The outcomes will provide tools with wide applicability to crop plants, enabling researchers and breeders access to genes and processes that contribute to establishing floral shape. Educational efforts focus on training students and post-docs in cutting edge interdisciplinary approaches that merge biology and mathematical modeling.<br/><br/>This project will develop a tool called the ""Computable Flower"" that permits the user to (i) integrate data on geometry, gene expression and biomechanics and (ii) explore, interpret and generate hypotheses based on data supported by mechanistic modeling approaches. The tool therefore provides an integrated description in the form of a 3D dynamic template of the growing flower bud.  The Computable Flower will be populated with existing or novel quantitative datasets coming from experimental and computational techniques concerning the spatial distribution of regulatory molecules such as transcription factors and hormones, and the spatial expression patterns of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodeling which operate downstream and upstream from these regulatory networks. Information on the spatial organization and properties of structural elements of the developing flower, including cell wall stiffness, microtubule orientation and cellulose microfibril organization will be added to the template.  Following this, temporal information will be included, showing correlations of gene expression, mechanical properties of the tissue, and changes in geometry.  This will lead to computational models and hypotheses regarding biochemical, physical and geometrical properties with simulation outcomes quantitatively compared with experimental data. Predictions coming from the modeling will guide experiments using domain-specific perturbation of genes that influence microtubule and wall status. These transgenic lines will then be subjected to detailed quantitative growth studies to test the validity of the model or to refine it.  The overall result will be a path to calculate floral phenotype from genotype that includes mechanical properties of tissues and their role in morphogenesis.

One of the major unanswered questions in biology is how causal and predictive the relationships are between mechanics and phenotypic diversity. This award will support a one-day symposium at the 2019 meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology to highlight novel trends and discoveries in evolutionary biomechanics. Emerging leaders (of various backgrounds and ranks) in the field will discuss how they are using cutting-edge methods to improve our understanding of phenotypic evolution. New imaging methods allow the rapid generation, storage, and analysis of scans and videos. Machine learning techniques and crowd-sourcing platforms are accelerating the pace of data collection and pattern detection. Evolutionary analysis is being facilitated by Next Generation Sequencing and advances in comparative phylogenetics. Combined, these developments are rapidly elucidating the governing principles that causally, and predictably, link physics to phenotypic diversity. Students will be paired with symposium speakers in small groups, with the explicit goal of helping students plan their next career steps and forge new research collaborations. This award may help build an emerging interdisciplinary research network and encourage a new generation of scientists in evolutionary biomechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Emily Dittmar is ""Evaluating the Cost of Domestication in Sunflower"".  The host institutions for the fellowship are the University of Georgia and the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. John Burke and Peter Morrell.<br/><br/>Deleterious mutations are present in the genomes of all organisms. Recent evidence suggests that crop genomes harbor a greater number of deleterious mutations (i.e. mutational load) than their wild relatives.  This mutational load may be caused by the process of domestication itself, which is often characterized by a reduction in genetic diversity and strong selection for traits of agronomic interest. This project aims to understand the causes and consequences of mutational load in cultivated sunflower. Results from this study will provide knowledge about how domestication-related processes increase deleterious variants and the effects of overall mutational load on crop performance. Training objectives include genomics and computational training in the analysis of genomic data. Broader impacts include developing lesson plans about crop evolution and genetic variation for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The relative importance of selective sweeps versus genetic drift on the accumulation of deleterious variants in sunflower will be inferred through a determination of the genome-wide distribution of deleterious mutations and by comparing mutational load in elite cultivars to that of historical landrace varieties. These deleterious variants will be identified using computational approaches that estimate deleterious effects based on the degree of phylogenetic sequence conservation. This study will test the explanatory power of these methods using performance data from hundreds of cultivated sunflower lines to determine how well the identified deleterious variants explain variation in performance. A completely novel component to this project is that it will investigate whether the effects of deleterious variants are elevated in stressful environments. Evidence from wild species show that deleterious mutations sometimes have greater effects under stress, but the degree to which the environment interacts with mutational load in crops has so far been unexplored. Results from this research which will focus almost exclusively on publicly available data will be shared through publications, presentations at conferences, and software, code and analyses will be accessible through GitHub. <br/><br/>Keywords: domestication, phylogenetic analysis, population genomics, sunflower, mutational load, deleterious mutations, plant biotic stress<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it has been hypothesized that plants can fail to make all the B vitamins they need when exposed to heat, drought, or other climatic stresses, and that the resulting vitamin deficiencies cause metabolic defects leading to yield and vigor losses. Using maize, this project will exploit cutting-edge genetic, genomic, and metabolic computer modeling approaches to test this hypothesis, i.e. to determine the extent to which climatic stress effects on metabolism are due to B vitamin deficiency. Potential outcomes include the provision of a new paradigm for understanding stress metabolism and breeding for adaptation to climate stress, and the identification of specific genes to improve stress adaptation. With regard to outreach and training, the project will provide for research training activities that will put genome-scale metabolic modeling in researchers' hands.  In addition to the training of postdoctoral associates and students, the project will hold a yearly workshop in metabolic modeling and comparative genomics to train faculty, postdoctorals, and students with an emphasis on those from Minority-serving Institutions.  <br/><br/>B Vitamins form a network. Past studies imply that this network is severely impacted by climatic stresses and that the resulting vitamin deficiencies lead to plant underperformance. However the surprising idea that stresses cause B vitamin deficiencies has never been rigorously tested. Nor have the metabolic consequences of B vitamin depletion in plants been systematically defined. This project will do both using a metabolic systems approach with maize as a model. It will also fill crucial gaps in the B vitamin network by identifying 'missing' transporters and enzymes.  Project objectives are to create a panel of vitamin B-deficient maize lines and acquire transcriptome and metabolome data; build metabolic models that - for the first time in plants - will include all B vitamins/cofactors as working parts and use them to predict how vitamin deficiency affects leaf metabolism and gene expression; predict stress-induced vitamin deficiency by comparing climate-stress and vitamin-deficiency transcriptomes and metabolomes, and validate predictions by supplying vitamins; and, identify candidate transporter and enzyme genes from transcriptome data and modeling, validate them biochemically and genetically, and upgrade the model by adding them. This research will inform perspectives on how B vitamin deficiency impacts plant gene expression and metabolism and in so doing, provide new insight into the manipulation of stress metabolism and breeding for metabolic adaptation to climate stress.  All genome-scale datasets will be publicly available at PlantSEED (http://plantseed.theseed.org/) and GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  The project's annotation, metabolic reconstruction, and modeling capabilities will also be publicly available in PlantSEED and will be leveraged to support Gramene, the iPlant Collaborative, and the AraCyc, MaizeCyc, and PlantCyc databases. Vitamin-deficient maize lines will be a unique resource to study B vitamins and their exchange with the microbiome, and will be made publicly available via the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center."

The ability to maneuver (e.g., accelerate, turn quickly and tightly) generally decreases as mass increases, suggesting there is an upper size limit for maneuvering aquatic animals.  This study will evaluate the size dependence of maneuverability of the largest animals in the ocean, rorqual whales, performing natural behaviors in the wild. Custom-designed removable sensors placed on the bodies of free-ranging whales will record their movement while aerial drones with specialized cameras will measure the size and shape of the whales and their appendages (i.e., flippers, flukes) at the surface of the water. By combining these data with mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic forces, different sized whale species can be compared to determine mechanical constraints imposed by size as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world?s largest predators. This project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary research that integrates engineering and physics with biology.  Further, the results may provide insights into the biomimetic design of autonomous underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuvering performance. <br/><br/>Movement is a fundamental aspect of animal life. Quantifying the fine-scale movement of individuals has important consequences for understanding physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Maneuvering capacity is also critically important as it governs an animal's ability to capture prey, avoid predators and obstacles, inhabit complex environments, and compete for mates. Investigations into how animals maneuver in aquatic environments remains poorly understood, particularly for large animals at the extreme of animal body mass. This proposal develops a bio-logging and remote sensing approach, with computational modeling, to analyze the kinematics and maneuverability of free-ranging rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) ranging in body mass by an order of magnitude. Swimming performance (i.e., acceleration: change in swimming velocity; agility: rate of turning; maneuverability: turning radius) will decrease as body size increases across rorqual species and that these mechanical constraints imposed by morphology size will be evident as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world's largest predators. Custom engineered multi-sensor animal-borne tags and Fluid Lensing cameras attached to aerial drones will be used to analyze the kinematics and morphology of rorquals in the open ocean. This approach enables us to quantify the high-resolution kinematics of rorquals engaged in natural maneuvers while simultaneously quantifying the morphological dimensions of tagged animal, including control and propulsion surfaces.

These differences support the view that fin rays and autopods are patterned by distinctly separate genes and genetic 'circuits'.  If this were true, studies of fin ray growth and regeneration may not be directly transferable to studies of limb birth defects and regeneration research, including in humans.  However, preliminary data from this project shows that the same genetic circuits do form the skeletons of both fins and limbs.  This project will confirm this common fin/limb building program, first characterizing the activity of key genes in the developing fins of two fish ideally suited to address these questions, the American paddlefish and the small spotted catshark.  These results will then guide experiments to test gene function, which will be compared to known data for developing limbs.  Outcomes will show that a shared genetic program regulates formation of fins and limbs and demonstrate that fish fins are a powerful research tool for the study of limbs.  Part of the success of this program will be the training of new researchers - a diverse group of graduate and undergraduates will bring their talents to this project and contribute to public outreach experiences in the Atlanta area public school system.<br/><br/><br/>The developmental basis of the fin-to-limb transition remains a longstanding question in evolutionary biology.  In current models, fins are patterned by distinct proximal and distal developmental modules, generating adult skeletal compartments containing endochondral or dermal elements respectively.  Emphasis on skeletal type led to the hypothesis that fin-folds and autopods are not homologous, patterned by different modules, despite similar distal positions.  However, new findings raise an intriguing alternative hypothesis: that autopods share a deep regulatory homology with dermal fin rays.  This project will build a model for the evolutionary origin of the distal paired appendage gene regulatory network (GRN), expanding on discoveries in two phylogenetically well-positioned vertebrates, the American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) and the small spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). To test this model, RNA-seq will be used to build a comprehensive transcriptional map in the fin compartments of paddlefish. These datasets will be compared to existing transcriptomic resources to identify candidate distal appendage GRN genes, which will be tested via pharmacological perturbation assays in paddlefish and complementary gene expression assays in catshark.  CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene knockdowns will test HoxA gene function in paddlefish fins.  Together, the outcomes of this project will elucidate key components of the distal appendage GRN, catalyze new research directions that regulate early skeletogenesis, and reinvigorate interest in the use of fins for the study of limb birth defects and regeneration studies. The proposed work will train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students, including those recruited through minority participation programs. The PI and students will collaborate on outreach programs to Atlanta area public high schools through virtual access to the PI's lab, classroom visits, and summer intern programs."

These ant transportation systems, common among beneficial and pest species, are similar to human transportation systems in many ways. Like subway systems and road networks, their goal is to move resources and individuals quickly and efficiently from place to place. Having alternative routes within a transportation system can make travel faster and more reliable, especially following disruptions or backlogs on particular routes. Yet extra routes cost additional resources. Designing an efficient and reliable transportation system at minimal cost is a difficult problem even for human engineers, who can take a system-wide perspective. Ant colonies, in contrast, build their transportation networks with no central vision or overarching plan. Certain species are nonetheless able to create systems that are remarkably reliable, efficient, and low-cost. This research will develop a new framework to explain how ant colonies create such well-functioning transportation systems via a process of gradual modification rather than design. Undergraduates, graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers will be mentored as part of an interdisciplinary, international team. High school students from groups underrepresented in STEM will be mentored by undergraduates with guidance from the PIs. This research could help inspire new management strategies for invasive ant pests, and new design algorithms for human transportation systems. Results will be shared with the public via a series of short films, exhibits and presentations at Florida state parks, and an established undergraduate-authored blog.<br/><br/>Despite the ubiquity of biological and human-engineered transportation networks, there is no unifying framework for predicting how they respond dynamically and adaptively to external pressures in a way that balances infrastructure cost, transportation efficiency, and robustness. The central objective of the project is to develop a general theory for how environmental constraints and opportunities shape dynamic transportation networks, emphasizing the interactions between network structure and function. A generative agent-based network approach will be used to create a general model of dynamic transportation networks. The model will explore how networks respond effectively to environmental challenges via processes of dynamic network restructuring that operate under a range of ecological constraints. The model will be parameterized and tested initially with existing data for terrestrial wood-ant networks, and refined based on the results. Predictions will then be generated by the model for the substantially different region of the parameter space occupied by arboreal turtle ants, and tested with new field data on turtle ant network structure and usage. Finally, the model will be challenged with field and laboratory experiments using turtle ants, where the dynamic response of their transportation network will be tracked following changes to resource distributions, disturbance patterns, and spatial constraints. The project targets the development of theory with the potential to unify research on dynamic transportation networks across biological systems, with possible applications to a variety of natural and human problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their specialization, individuals in this scenario are adapted to utilize resources in different ways. However, matings between individuals from differently specialized populations are expected to produce intermediate forms that may not be able to survive well in any environment. One solution to this problem is achieved when variation within a species becomes completely associated with variant, or altered, forms of a chromosome. When variant forms of a chromosome contain multiple genes that are inherited as a single unit, this chromosome region is known as a ""supergene"". A growing body of evidence suggests that supergenes play key roles in innovation across the tree of life. Under the influence of a supergene, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta displays two social forms that differ in how many queens inhabit the ant colony and many other individual, colony, and life-history traits. Many of these differences relate to distinct strategies of colony founding by young queens. This research program will assess how variation in diet, nutrition, and supergene presence shape variation in behavior and reproduction in fire ant queens. This will shed new light on supergene origins and function in fire ants, a model for how supergenes can mediate variation in behavior and reproduction in this and other species as well. Broader impacts of the program include partnering with a local high school to offer experiential learning modules and summer research assistantships, integration of resulting data into undergraduate coursework, and providing new insights into the reproductive biology of an economically important invasive species. <br/><br/>This project will explore the extent to which gene expression differences between queens of alternate social forms in Solenopsis invicta reflect convergence with nutritional plasticity, and thus implicate genetic accommodation. In other words, the research will test the hypothesis that a nutritional ground plan played a key role in the origin of queen polymorphism (and, hence, colony social polymorphism) in S. invicta. This work will provide important insights into the proximal basis of queen polymorphism (i) by decoupling gene expression differences due to variation in nutrition and supergene genotype in individual tissues of S. invicta and (ii) by decoupling the effects of queen genotype (endogenous genetic effects) and colony worker genotypes (indirect social genetic effects) on the mediation of queen polymorphism. Taken together, this work will greatly improve our understanding of how phenotypic plasticity and supergenes mediate a complex behavioral polymorphism important in ant social evolution. Broader impacts of the research program include providing fundamental new information on the genomic and epigenomic factors that regulate the reproductive biology of an important invasive pest species, partnering with a local high school biology teacher to develop new experiential learning modules and to provide summer research assistantships for students in the investigator's laboratories, and integrating the data generated by the project into undergraduate coursework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not only does flowering time affect plant fitness, but also the yield of grains, fruits, and seeds available for human consumption. But how do plants in different climates know to vary their flowering times, and what happens as these local climates change over time? To address these questions, this project focuses on a geographically and ecologically diverse group of cereal crop and forage grasses with the aim of determining how flowering time has evolved at both the whole plant and genetic level under global cooling over the past 50 million years. By shedding light on the past, results of this study promise to allow better prediction of flowering time responses to current global change, and to isolate novel genes and genetic pathways for the potential manipulation of flowering time in crop grasses.<br/><br/>The ""pooid"" grasses evolved from a tropical ancestor around 48 million years ago and have subsequently colonized a wide range of habitats in both the northern and southern temperate zones as global temperatures decreased. One of the major barriers to living in the temperate region is freezing temperatures, which are particularly detrimental to reproductive structures. The crop pooids barley, wheat, and oats are able to avoid flowering in winter by rapidly becoming competent to flower after an extended period of cold tempreatures (vernalization). However, it is unknown whether the evolution of the vernalization response was key to the diversification of all temperate pooids, or if it evolved more recently in separate grasses. To determine the evolutionary origin(s) and genetic basis of the vernalization response, the PI will work with students, a postdoctoral researcher, and computer scientists in the Vermont Genetics Network to carry out flowering time experiments on 40 species of pooid grasses collected from different latitudes across the world. The flowering time response of each species to cold temperatures will be mapped onto an evolutionary tree and models will be used to estimate when and how many times flowering in response to cold evolved. As a complement to this, genomic data will be collected to pinpoint similarities and differences in vernalization responsive gene expression between species. By determining different levels of plant responses to chilling, data from this project will facilitate critical insights into the complex adaptations of plants to their environments. Furthermore, activities and outcomes of this study will be used to foster interdisciplinary and active learning activities for high school to graduate students, paving the way for the next generation of successful organismal and evolutionary biologists."

The electrical firing properties of this cell population (referred to as the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN) generates a 24 hour oscillation (referred to as a circadian rhythm) that functions as a timing cue to ancillary neuronal oscillator populations found throughout the rest of the brain.  This circadian timing circuit has remarkable power over the nervous system. For example, key functions of the nervous system, such as the sleep/wake cycle, and complex cognitive processes (e.g., learning, memory and critical thinking skills) are modulated by this circadian rhythm.  Further, the disruption of this circadian timekeeping system has profound effects on mood, cognitive capacity and sleep.   Notably, the disruption of circadian timing can result from alterations in one's work schedule (often seen in night shift workers), or from a number of acquired and congenital disorders of the brain (e.g., depression, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease).  In fact, the disruption of circadian timing in individuals with Alzheimer's disease is considered to be one of the most pressing issues for health care workers.  This rich series of observations raises questions about the functional relationship between the SCN and ancillary neuronal oscillator populations, and, relatedly, about the underlying neuronal circuits that modulate cognitive capacity over the circadian cycle.  In this application, the researchers propose to employ a wide array of innovative interdisciplinary approaches to determine the functional significance and mechanistic underpinnings by which circadian clock timing in brain circuits modulate complex cognitive processes, such as learning and memory.  The research will also provide an opportunity for direct student involvement in research and the data from the study will be used to generate an interactive website for outreach to the public and included in the Brain Awareness Program that presents research findings to elementary and middle schools.<br/><br/>Within the central nervous system, rhythmicity is not restricted to the SCN, but rather, is found in a diversity of brain regions.  In line with this, forebrain structures, including the cortex and hippocampus, express all of the molecular components required to drive clock timing. Here, the researchers propose to systematically test the contribution of forebrain clocks to the circadian regulation of learning and memory.  This application is predicated on the hypothesis that the SCN clock works in a coordinated manner with ancillary hippocampal/forebrain oscillators to regulate cognitive capacity as a function of the time of day.  To test this idea, the researchers propose to use an innovative set of transgenic animal models that will allow them to resolve clock timing at a single cell level, and thus, create a systems and cellular level blueprint of hippocampal timing (Objectives 1 and 2). This aim will allow the researchers to identify the cycling cell types (e.g., glutamatergic excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons, astrocytes and microglia) and to assess the phase relationship of discrete oscillator populations. Addressing these questions is key to the understanding of the tightly intertwined relationship between circadian timing and cognition.  In Objectives 3 and 4, the researchers will use conditional knockout technology to disrupt forebrain circadian timing and assess the effects on learning and memory.  Importantly, with this approach, SCN timing will be intact, and thus, the scientists will be able to specifically test the contribution of forebrain oscillators to learning and memory. These data sets will provide new insights into the complex processes by which the clock shapes cognition, and in turn provide a foundation for further experimental approaches designed to reveal clock functionality in a broad range of physiological and psychological processes."

A specific region of the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for coordinating the brain's circadian rhythms. Little is known about how this coordination happens. This project examines the circadian function of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in complex thinking, such as planning and decision-making, and the control of mood and emotions. The project will test the innovative hypothesis that a specific hormone (glucocorticoid hormone) serves as communicator between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the prefrontal cortex. The project will use a systems biology approach to determine how glucocorticoid hormones regulate prefrontal cortex circadian rhythms in rats. The project also will use cutting-edge manipulations of prefrontal cortex gene expression to discern the mechanisms by which circadian rhythms contribute to optimal prefrontal cortex function. The studies will result in new understanding of glucocorticoid hormone physiology and its role in the coordination of brain circadian function. This new understanding could have significant benefit for society by promoting new strategies to combat disturbed circadian function, such as occurs with night-shift work, jet lag, seasonal extremes, aging, and certain disorders. The research will provide excellent research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from diverse backgrounds through an ongoing partnership with the University of Colorado's STEM Center for Learning and Diversity. Findings from this research will be disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through research team presentations on campus, at regional and national scientific meetings and community forums, and postings on a public lab web-site.<br/><br/>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to the advanced cognitive function in mammalian species. Strong diurnal variation in cognitive function suggests that mPFC operation is under circadian control. The mPFC lacks direct neural connection with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master clock in the brain, but has high expression of glucocorticoid receptors, supporting the prospect that corticosterone (CORT) participates in the entrainment of mPFC rhythmic clock gene expression. Preliminary data show dynamic modulation of mPFC clock gene expression that depends on the prior daily profile of diurnal circulating patterns of CORT. Moreover, a mPFC-dependent memory task, conditioned fear extinction, displays a diurnal variation in expression that is absent in adrenalectomized rats. Based on these supporting preliminary data, the project will determine whether: 1) CORT contributes to entrainment of mPFC rhythmic clock gene expression, 2) an appropriately timed daily CORT pulse is necessary for normal entrainment of diurnal variation in mPFC-dependent conditioned fear extinction, and 3) CORT entrainment of mPFC-mediated conditioned fear extinction depends on CORT activation of mPFC glucocorticoid receptors and rhythmic mPFC clock gene expression. The proposed research will provide excellent scientific training opportunities for a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. A range of avenues will be used for dissemination of the findings of this project and their value to society."

This project seeks to test the emancipation hypothesis proposed by Tinbergen 60 years ago to understand how a novel behavior arises by using a hybrid zone between two species of hummingbirds. The novel behavior is a courtship display that is performed by one species, Allen's Hummingbird, and not the other, Rufous Hummingbird. In this stereotyped display, called the 'pendulum display', the male flies back and forth over a female while producing distinctive sounds with his wings. The investigators will record displays from 400 birds from within a hybrid zone between these two species, and then search for genes associated with individual components of the behavior, by sequencing the genomes of these 400 birds. Understanding how one behavior splits into two will reveal a fundamental mechanism of how behavior evolves.  Additionally, this grant will train of students of diverse backgrounds, and enable outreach to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside by funding purchase of an 'acoustic camera', allowing deaf children to learn more about sound through this newly invented way of visualizing it. <br/><br/>As the genetic underpinnings of how one behavior splits into two 'paramorphs', alternate forms of a previously unitary character, have not been demonstrated for any behavior, the analyses presented here aim to do so for the first time. This 3-year study has three objectives: (1) Hybrid zone mapping and cline analysis: phenotype, genotype, and selection (2): Sequence analysis of complex display behavior, and (3): Admixture mapping of behavior and morphology. Together these objectives will provide information about selection on the display traits of interest, and test the paramorph hypothesis directly, using phenotypic and genotypic data respectively. Current data indicate no fixed genetic differences between the species within coding regions of the genome, hinting that the paramorphic behavior could be driven by differences in gene regulation between the two species, rather than as the result of a paralogous gene.  Just as the modern view of morphological diversity was transformed by the study of its genetic basis, a direct assessment of the genes underlying a behavior that varies across a hybrid zone will allow one of the first tests of how a complex motor pattern has evolved. This project will build infrastructure through addition of sound, video, and specimens to the Macaulay Library at Cornell University, San Diego Natural History Museum and the SDSU Museum of Biodiversity."

The key to their locomotive prowess is coordination among their pulsed jet, flapping fins, and flexible arms, but little is presently known about how these units work together throughout these animals' lives as they encounter different physical environments, change developmentally, and experience dissimilar ecosystems. This project focuses on understanding how the jet, fins, and arms operate in concert to produce the necessary forces for exceptional turning, both in terms of muscle capabilities and hydrodynamics, in squid and cuttlefish of different developmental stages (hatchlings to adults).  This work will involve cutting edge 3D flow visualization approaches, high-speed video analysis, and advanced mathematical tools that highlight the essential components of high-performance turns.  This project promises to (1) advance our understanding of how highly maneuverable marine animals navigate through their complex habitats and (2) reveal key performance characteristics, structures, and behaviors that can be integrated potentially into the design of mechanical bio-inspired systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles, to improve their turning/docking capabilities.  This project incorporates a number of outreach projects, including demonstrations in local schools, participation in robotics competitions, development of web-based tutorials and summer camps, and presentations at aquariums and museums. <br/><br/>Maneuvering in the aquatic environment is a significant component of routine swimming, with proficient maneuvering being essential for predator avoidance, prey capture, and navigation.  Despite its importance, understanding of the biomechanics of maneuvering behaviors is limited.  An investigation of maneuvering performance in three morphologically distinct species of cephalopods is proposed here.  The investigation explores three broad questions: (1) how are the fins, arms, and funnel-jet complex used in concert to maximize turning performance in adult cephalopods; (2) do the relative importance of turning rate and turning radius change over ontogeny and are fewer turning modes observed in young cephalopods; and (3) do fin, arm, and funnel musculoskeletal mechanics change over ontogeny and are such changes associated with differences in maneuvering? These questions will be addressed by collecting measurements of 3D high-speed kinematics and 2D/3D hydrodynamics of wake flows; performing mathematical analyses to quantitatively identify and categorize turning patterns; and measuring both the dynamic passive and active length-force relationship and maximum shortening velocity of muscle fibers that drive the movements used during turning and jet vectoring.  The proposed work will: (1) provide data on how an ecologically important marine animal coordinates its novel dual-mode system (jet and fins) and arms to achieve high turning performance, (2) highlight the essential kinematic and hydrodynamic elements of turns, (3) offer insights into how maneuvering capabilities change over a broad ontogenetic range, and (4) provide novel data on the muscle properties of muscular hydrostatic organs and their role in turning."

While it is known that plants synthesize a novel chemical when exposed to conditions such as cold, drought and high salinity, what is not understood is how the plant ""cleans house"", that is, how the stress signal is removed so that the plant can begin normal growth once the stress is gone. Both genetic and biochemical approaches will be taken to determine exactly how these changes happen. This research will provide training of multiple UC-Davis undergraduates through research projects and support a graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar. These individuals will learn scientific methodology and how to present scientific data to colleagues and the greater community. They will learn analytical skills and improve their speaking and writing abilities. The graduate student will have the opportunity to interact with K-12 schools in neighboring communities with large Hispanic populations. The researcher will interact with representatives of the California seed/agricultural biotechnology industries through the Seed Institute at UC-Davis. The researcher has established a connection with a local Sacramento high school teacher and will continue this collaboration. The high school students will learn experimental design and data analysis, and participate in scientific discovery. <br/><br/><br/>Plants respond to environmentally stressful conditions by upregulating expression of genes that help them cope. One family of transcription factors required for stress responses are called ABRE BINDING PROTEINS (ABFs), and are regulated at the protein level. Under stress they are activated to promote transcription and at the same time their degradation is stopped and protein levels increase. How stress causes these two changes in ABFs and their relationship to biological function are not understood. ABF amino acids responsible for regulating constitutive ABF proteolysis under normal growth conditions and for stress-induced protein stabilization will be determined through in vitro and in vivo degradation assays. DNA sequences encoding ABF proteins will be changed so they translate ABF proteins with deletions and/or amino acid substitutions. ABF segments will also be fused with coding regions of marker enzymes and stability of the fusion determined in rapid and quantitative assays. Altered proteins will be expressed and purified from bacteria and stability measured in plant lysates. Sequences will be introduced into plants, multiple stable lines expressing these proteins produced and the in vivo protein stability measured. The role of phosphorylation status will be assessed by measuring the stability of proteins with substituted predicted or possible phosphorylation sites with either alanine, which cannot be modified, or with aspartate, which mimics modification. Transgenic plants expressing ABF proteins with differences in degradation rates will be assessed for their growth phenotypes under normal and stress conditions to determine if modulation of degradation provides greater stress resistance without compromising normal growth."

Only a few of the many SSPs encoded in plant genomes have been characterized functionally in plants. In this respect, SSP-encoding genes represent some of the potentially most important ""dark matter"" of plant genomes. Medicago truncatula is a premier model legume species, which is closely related to the most important forage species in the USA, Medicago sativa (alfalfa), and to food legumes such as soybean and common bean. Legumes are key components of sustainable agricultural systems because they form symbioses with bacteria called rhizobia that reduce molecular nitrogen to ammonium in specialized root organs called nodules. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation provides legumes with a source of nitrogen, obviating the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for these important crop species. Recently, it has become clear that SSPs can control both nodule and root development in legumes and the hunt is on for more SSPs that control important developmental traits in legumes of importance to agriculture. A priority objective of this project therefore is to identify novel SSPs that affect root and nodule development in M. truncatula, with a long-term view of using SSPs in non-transgenic approaches to improve plants for agriculture. Datasets and biological materials generated in this project will be made available through appropriate biological databases and stock centers. A database (MtSSPdb) will be developed and maintained for both project and public access to store, link and present the information on the comparative genomics of peptide-coding genes and to integrate and manage all experimental data emerging from this project. With regard to outreach and training, the project will leverage existing programs to provide research training for postdoctoral associates and graduate, undergraduate and high school students.   <br/> <br/>A multidisciplinary strategy will be implemented, including bioinformatics, chemical genomics, genetics, biochemistry, molecular and developmental biology. Activities of this project comprise a genome-wide survey of SSP-encoding genes in Medicago truncatula and the identification of macronutrient (N, P, S, and K) -responsive SSP-encoding genes from transcriptome data. A library of genome-encoded, synthetic peptides will be established as a community resource for biochemical genetics and used to screen for developmental and molecular phenotypes in M. truncatula. Constitutive overexpression lines will be produced in Arabidopsis thaliana and M. truncatula for selected SSP-encoding genes that are prioritized because they have been shown to be either strongly responsive to macronutrients (N, P, S, K), produce strong visual/molecular phenotypes when chemically synthesized peptides are exogenously applied to M. truncatula, and/or have their mature peptides predicted to be produced through posttranslational modifications that make chemical synthesis and/or exogenous application impracticable. The synthetic peptides will be further tested for their effects on root nodule development and nitrogen fixation in M. truncatula. The Medicago HAPMAP genotypes will be employed to identify genetic loci associated with natural diversity in response to bioactive peptides, and specific SSPs will also be tested for their efficacy in improving alfalfa performance in the field. Identification of a peptide receptor through genetic or chemo-proteomic approaches is another activity included in this project."

The ability to increase crop production in the coming years will depend on developing a better understanding of reproductive mechanisms. The goal of this project is to take what has been learned about the molecules that mediate fertilization in a model plant species (Arabidopsis) and extend this knowledge using a comparative genomic approach in seven plant species including corn, rice, and tomato. The expected findings will allow for the identification of specific mechanisms that are targeted by environmental stresses during sexual reproduction in crops and will assist in the selection of stress-resistant cultivars. The outputs of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of sexual reproduction of economically important plant species. In addition this project will provide cutting edge training in biological imaging, genetics and genomics in the context of a critical crop plant (tomato) for a diverse team of researchers that will include a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate researcher. Importantly, this research team will be benefit from participation in this large, multidisciplinary and international effort comprising eight laboratories from five nations.<br/><br/>Research during the past five years has delivered tremendous new insights into gamete physiology and the mechanisms involved in fertilization in Arabidopsis. This progress has established the view that gametes are hyper-differentiated cell types with highly specific transcriptional profiles. Advances in microscopy based on fluorescent reporters and live cell imaging have also transformed research capability and provided insights into the mechanisms involved in gamete delivery, interaction and activation of seed development. Yet, the understanding of the complexity of double fertilization that characterizes flowering plants is far from complete and lacks any knowledge about the origin of mechanisms that predate double fertilization. In this project, emerging models representing key stages in plant evolution will be used to provide insight into the ancestral mechanisms of gamete differentiation and fertilization. Gene co-function networks will be identified from expression atlases for several plant species that include the liverwort Marchantia, the moss Physcomitrella and the extant basal flowering plant Amborella. These will be complemented with co-function networks from Arabidopsis and the economically important crops maize, tomato and rice and used to study the conservation of gene co-function networks governing male and female gametogenesis, pollen tube growth and fertilization mechanisms in flowering plants. Moreover, these investigations will provide novel molecular markers of fertility in crops. It is expected that this project will result in identification of fertilization factors that were lost from ancient angiosperms during the evolution of monocots (grasses) and eudicots and those which have evolved de novo in the angiosperm lineage.  All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, RNAseq datasets will be accessible through a consortium database as well as through publicly available data repositories."

Uniquely adapted to this harsh semi-arid zone, shea trees produce oil-rich nuts, which an estimated 18.4 million women gather and manually process into a nutrient-rich butter used as cooking oil, soap, and medicine for their families. Shea also provides a rare source of income to these subsistence households across 21 countries, as the butter is valued by both the cosmetics and chocolate industries. Referred to as ""women's gold,"" shea is one of the few resources that female members of rural households in the region control, from harvesting to commercialization. Despite its cultural, economic, and food security importance, however, the shea tree is under threat. Slow-growing shea trees traditionally are not planted; rather, nuts are gathered from mature, essentially wild trees found in minimally-managed areas called parklands. Due to increasing land-use pressures, the number of these parkland shea trees is declining. In a broad partnership with regional organizations, this project seeks to reverse this trend by improving the value of shea through modern breeding. By turning this semi-wild, variably-yielding species into a more actively managed and deliberately planted tree crop, the long-term impact of this project will be no less than improved livelihoods (enhanced nutrition, increased income, and more robust risk mitigation) for the millions of rural women and their families across sub-Saharan Africa currently dependent on the highly valued but threatened parkland populations of shea tree.<br/><br/>With the long juvenile period of shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa) making traditional breeding approaches untenable, efficient improvement of the species requires modern breeding tools, including publicly-available foundational genomics resources and highly characterized mapping populations. This project will develop such resources, thereby enabling the long-term genome-enabled improvement of this currently undomesticated species. An assembly of the highly heterozygous (>37%) 0.8 Gb diploid genome will be accomplished using long-read (PacBio; HGAP) sequencing of cv. 'AK01,' a key parent in West African shea breeding efforts to date. Once annotated using RNA-seq data from replicated, multiple-tissue libraries (Illumina Hi-seq; MAKER-P), a comprehensive collection of mapped and functionally-classified SNPs will be developed by resequencing (Ion Proton)100 diverse V. paradoxa accessions gathered from across the species' natural distribution. By also developing a nested association mapping population, a replicated association mapping panel, and an open-source repository for all genotypic and phenotypic data, this project aims to put genomic selection of improved shea populations within the reach of regional breeding and parkland regeneration programs. By training a PhD student and holding a regional workshop, the project also invests in the capacity building necessary to bring the full potential of these genomic, informatic, and plant genetic resources to fruition. Through a broad partnership with national programs, the CGIAR system, the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC), and the Global Shea Alliance (GSA), all project outcomes are poised for immediate translation to the shea improvement sector."

Yet, few have examined what factors contribute to individual variation in social behavior within a species or population. For instance, it has yet be to determined why some individuals are more gregarious than others. In mammals, it is known that mothers have a pervasive influence on offspring behavioral development, not just through genetic inheritance, but also through social learning (maternal effects). Here, the research team will focus on how maternal effects influence offspring social development, a key contributor to individual variation in social behavior. Dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, are an excellent empirical system for examining these questions because they live in a large open and dynamic social community with over one hundred potential associates to choose from. Long-term data on this social system spans 35+ years and enables this team of scientists to quantify: 1). how a dolphin changes its social behavior in space and time throughout its development, 2). the extent to which this is influenced by maternal and non-maternal effects, and 3). the extent to which maternal effects provide fitness benefits to offspring. This study will have broad reach, appeal, and implications well beyond the scientific community because it will contribute to wildlife policy, management, and conservation as well as train multiple undergraduate and graduate students and early-career stage researchers in STEM. <br/><br/><br/>While several studies link sociality to fitness in long-lived mammals, maternal influence on inter- and intra-individual variation in sociality (e.g. dynamic social patterns) and fitness outcomes is relatively unexplored. This study investigates how sociality evolved, not just why. Recent computational advances allow this project to incorporate multi-level, dynamic variation to advance understanding of how sociality evolved, i.e., transmission pathways. This study system, a 35-year longitudinal study of wild bottlenose dolphins, provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because of species characteristics, and the size, detail, and long-term nature of the dataset. This project will use: 1). novel quantitative genetics methodologies to unravel the importance of maternal effects on social behavior while accounting for both additive genetic variation and the mothers' social environment; 2). next-generation sequencing combined with demographic data to construct accurate pedigree information from high- density single nucleotide polymorphisms; 3). dynamic social network modeling (social association/interaction matrices) to account for changing social attributes of individuals rather than just static traits. As such, this study will be a comprehensive exploration of how maternal effects impact social traits over the lifespan and across more than one generation within an evolutionary framework. In addition, this is the first study to do so in wild long-lived mammal with extensive maternal social transmission, while accounting for additive genetic variation. The results will provide significant advances by extending our study of the genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of inheritance, which play critical roles in evolution and responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental heterogeneity results in divergent selective pressures that are important for creating and maintaining biological diversity; however, little is known about how organisms respond to such spatially varying selection at the genetic level. This project investigates the genetic basis of plant adaption to variation in soils.  Serpentine soils present particularly challenging environments for plants ? they are deficient in several essential plant nutrients, notably calcium (Ca), and contain toxic levels of magnesium (Mg) and heavy metals. However some species, such as Mimulus guttatus, are able to grow both on and off of these harsh soils. This research will characterize soil, climatic, and fitness traits related to serpentine adaptation from populations of M. guttatus distributed on and off serpentine soils from British Columbia to southern California, and investigate whether serpentine tolerance in these widespread populations has evolved via the same or different genetic and physiological mechanisms. Establishing the genetic basis of plant adaptation to and the degree of parallelism across widespread populations will contribute to a broader understanding of plant physiology, ecology and evolution that will advance the ability to conserve and subsequently to exploit genetic diversity to produce new crops and plant communities with greater resilience to emerging changes in the environment, including salinity and mineral nutrient stress. Serpentine tolerance in Mimulus provides an integrative and accessible example of plant adaptation, so in addition to mentoring of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, and underrepresented minority high school students, the investigators will develop and test the effectiveness of data generated by this work to demonstrate core concepts in biology for undergraduates. This resource would be developed in part through a new capstone undergraduate course at Duke University. The investigators will also train a public school high school teacher and assist in the development, teaching, assessment, and modification of teaching modules for introductory and AP biology classes.<br/><br/>The molecular genetic basis of adaptation to serpentine soil will be investigated in M. guttatus , an ecological genomic model species with a rapid generation time, high quality annotated genome sequence, extensive genomic resources, and well developed methods for stable transformation. Serpentine soils are usually lethal, but hundreds of populations of M. guttatus have repeatedly adapted to these soils across geographically and geologically distinct regions in western North America, from British Columbia to southern California. The four aims in the project will result in one of the most complete and detailed studies of how plant species evolve in response to spatially varying selection and elucidate the physiological, cellular, and molecular genetic mechanisms underlying parallel adaptation.  In Aim 1, reciprocal transplant experiments, ionomic profiling, and detailed soil analysis will be conducted for 20 pairs of adjacent serpentine and non-serpentine M. guttatus populations from five geographically and geologically diverse regions.  Aim 2 will utilize pooled population genomic sequence data from each of the 40 populations to identify candidate genes and SNPs underlying parallel serpentine adaptation, and evaluate whether individual candidate genes and molecular pathways are shared across widespread serpentine regions or have evolved in response to particular serpentine sites. In Aim 3, new, highly efficient and cost-effective methods for QTL mapping combined with physiological, ionomic, and soil transplant experiments, will be used to identify the loci that are most important for local adaptation to serpentine soils at each of the eight serpentine regions, determine whether QTLs are unique or shared across regions, and for each major QTL evaluate the likely physiological mechanisms involved in tolerance.  Aim 4 involves using fine-scale genetic mapping, positional cloning, and transgenic experimental approaches combined with tests of physiological and biochemical function to identify the most important genes involved in local adaptation to serpentine soils and characterize their cellular and molecular mechanisms."

This research project tests a new idea, that learning also importantly involves molecular changes in other parts of nerve cells which control the production of electrical activity required for these cells to communicate with each other. Learning is studied in the context of how young songbirds learn to sing, which happens in a similar way to how humans learn to speak, play a musical instrument, or produce any complicated sequence of behavior. Using a combination of behavioral observation and recording together with anatomical, physiological, molecular, computational and statistical techniques, the research team will test the hypothesis that developmental singing changes are accompanied by changes in cell electrical activity that are not located at synapses. They will also identify the mechanistic basis for these electrical changes. This research will reveal important new details about how the brain can store learned information for an entire lifetime. It will also provide student research assistants with broad multidisciplinary training, as well as developing new analytical software and computational models that will benefit the broader neuroscience community (these will be made freely available through a publically-accessible web site). Neuroscience and mathematics videos tagged to specific State-mandated high school learning objectives will also be produced, which will be made available to teachers via a cataloged State portal. Finally, the research team conducts a wide variety of community education programs specifically related to neuroscience, birdsong, and learning.  These activities include programs for K-12 schools as well as a scholarly course for senior citizens.<br/><br/>Much is known about the brain areas and circuits that underlie birdsong learning. Consequently, scientists know where to look for learning-induced changes (an area named HVC), but they do not know what neural changes encode the auditory memories of song. The proposed research tests the novel hypothesis that changes in specific, non-synaptic ionic currents in HVC neurons contribute to the encoding of auditory memories. Songbird auditory learning can be readily manipulated by controlling exposure to a tutor song. Preliminary data show that the intrinsic cell body/axonal channel properties of HVC neurons change in an experience-dependent manner during song development. The research team's recent characterization and modeling of the ionic currents that determine the physiology of HVC neurons in the adult finch now allow for the proposed developmental studies. Proposed studies will test hypotheses about the developmental emergence of specific ionic currents as they relate to sensory learning. This will lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this learning. As part of this project, the team will also correct mistaken views about HVC of female zebra finches. Long thought to lack male-typical connectivity, new data show that female and male HVC have the same cell types and patterns of extrinsic connectivity. Since females show auditory learning of tutor song, but do not sing, analysis of female HVC will provide a critical test of the proposed hypotheses. Together, the proposed experiments will provide clues to fundamental questions about how early sensory information is stored as a stable memory trace that lasts a lifetime."

Physiological responses include changes in the metabolic rates and the proteins that affect metabolism during the animal's lifetime.  These reversible, non-genetic changes buffer an individual's health in a changing environment.  Yet, there are limits to these physiological responses, and animals may evolve genetic changes that affect their metabolism and enhance their survival.  This research investigates the interaction between physiological and adaptive changes to better understand the mechanisms affecting health and fitness.  This research takes advantage of new DNA sequencing technologies to define 10,000s of genetic differences among environments and relate these to measures of gene expression.  The data from this research will inform society about the genes and gene expression that enhances health in a variety of environments.  Included in this research is the training of undergraduate and high-school students from a diversity of economic and social backgrounds. <br/><br/>Part 2:To enhance our ability to predict responses to climate change, we need to understand the relative importance of acclimatory responses and the potential for adaptive divergence.  Although there are several good vertebrate models for thermal adaptive divergence among taxa and many acclimation response examples, few studies examine the interaction between acclimatory responses and adaptive divergence.  To examine this interaction, this research first measures derived changes in metabolism and the effect of thermal acclimation and then uses the variation in these measures to interrogate the importance of mRNA and DNA variation.  Two major goals of this proposed research are to utilize genotyping by sequencing to provide tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms and apply RNA-Seq to measure most expressed genes to determine if 1) nucleotide divergence among the three thermal effluent populations share similar adaptive divergence and 2) acclimatory and adaptive changes in mRNA expression affect the same loci.  Our predictions are that acclimatory and adaptive changes in mRNA expression involve different genes, that many loci can effect a change in metabolism and thus different populations will have different mRNA expression patterns that statistically explain the variation in metabolism, and similarly, that the SNPs associated with changes in mRNA expression or metabolism will differ in different populations.  These predictions suggest that because the loci involved in physiological responses are different from those affected by adaptive divergence, there is greater potential for adaptive change than if the same loci were involved.  Additionally, we predict that there are many different ways to achieve a change in metabolism, which means that there are many different polymorphic loci that selection can act on.  Providing the data to support or reject these hypotheses would enhance our understanding of evolutionary physiology and thus significantly influence our ability to predict climate change effects on species' abundance and survival."

Substantial data show how this coordination is established in vertebrates. However, some of the most basic questions concerning how eye components are coordinated in invertebrates remain unanswered. This project primarily focuses on Sunburst Diving Beetles as a particularly valuable system for analyzing these key factors because they can be manipulated on the molecular level and their larvae have extremely sophisticated eyes, the focus of which can be quantified. To test for the generality of the identified mechanisms, and in specific instances dissect them further, synergistic experiments are performed on the genetically powerful fly model Drosophila melanogaster. The eyes of both animals are evaluated using a micro-ophthalmoscope that has recently been developed in the host laboratory. Preliminary findings suggest that both beetle and fly eyes are able to develop astonishingly precise focus in the absence of visual feedback. If confirmed, invertebrate eyes could become an important general model for precisely tuned organ development that is easily assessable and can be manipulated at the molecular-genetic level. The execution of this project involves training of many undergraduate and graduate students, who will also actively participate in outreach activities. In addition, the project involves the development of synergistic teaching modules.<br/><br/>The principal eyes of diving beetle larvae are sophisticated visual organs that rapidly grow to ~130% of their original size at the second to third instar transition. It is likely that such eye elongation involves changes in osmotic pressure. The lens also needs to be reformed, which takes considerably longer (~8 h) and likely involves some of the 10 lens proteins that have been identified through a previous collaboration of the PI and Co-PI. Aim 1 of the project uses a unique live imaging technique (the micro-ophthalmoscope) that allows direct visualization of the retina and measurement of the refractive states (focusing into infinity or being near- or far-sighted) of very small invertebrate eyes, including those of the diving beetle larvae and individual D. melanogaster ommatidia. This technique is used in combination with traditional optical methods and behavioral tests in diving beetles to test if visual input is necessary for proper eye growth in these animals. Aim 2 uses physical manipulations and pharmacology to evaluate the contribution of osmotic pressure to eye-tube growth and aim 3 uses in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and RNAi knockdowns of the identified lens proteins to investigate how the complex Thermonectus lenses change focal lengths. Targeted parallel experiments on D. melanogaster explore the generality of specific findings. It is expected that this integrative approach will provide some of the first data to address the long overdue question of how eye growth is coordinated in arthropods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will select and re-sequence 506 accessions of cotton (and its wild, diploid relatives). These DNA sequences will be used to identify individual plants that contain unique genetic diversity. The understanding of genetic diversity will illuminate basic biological processes in cotton and will provide genomic resources for improvement of the domestic cotton crop.

Neurons are the most well-known; they communicate with each other by generating spikes of electrical activity. The second cell type, glial cells, play a variety of roles that are less well understood. In the awake adult brain, the overall spiking activity of neurons appears random. However, in deep sleep or under anesthesia, the spiking activity pattern becomes synchronized within and between various brain regions. During brain development, this type of synchronous spiking is thought to be necessary for the circuit maturation, and the establishment and maintenance of the functional organization of the brain. The focus of this research is to understand the role of one type of glial cell (astrocytes) in the emergence of synchronous spiking activity patterns in the developing brain. The main hypothesis is that astrocytes play a decisive role in the synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain. Preliminary data has demonstrated that astrocytes are necessary for synchronization of spiking activity; the proposed research will elucidate the molecular pathways within astrocytes that control the synchronization of spiking in surrounding neurons. The results of this research will identify fundamental mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions that shape synchronous activity during brain development. This project is conducted at a Historically Black University, and will immerse minority students in cutting edge neuroscience research, and foster peer-mentoring based on interactions between undergraduate and graduate researchers.<br/><br/>Preliminary data using mixed neuron and astrocyte cultures on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) showed random spiking activity which synchronized over time, in comparison to astrocyte-free neuronal cultures, which only show random activity without synchronization. The main hypothesis of this research is that astrocytic release of glutamate mediated by the mGluR1 G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathway mediates the effects of astrocytes on the development of neuronal synchronous activity. A model for the mechanism by which the astrocyte mGluR1 pathway mediates neuronal synchronization will be tested using several different dominant negative constructs. A dominant-negative mGluR1 receptor that blocks downstream signaling will be used to understand this signaling pathway's role in both population synchrony, and in the temporal relationship between calcium oscillations within astrocytes and the development of neuronal synchronous bursts.  A dominant-negative SNARE protein Vamp2/Syb2 will be used to block glutamate release from astrocytes. The role of the mGluR1 pathway and mGluR1 mediated glutamate release in the development of synchrony will also be examined in vivo. The strength of this project is the combination of multi-electrode electrophysiology, molecular dissection of the mGluR1 pathway in astrocytes, and computational analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When individuals prefer different outcomes, how do societies agree on one choice for everyone? Human groups have developed a variety of methods, from despotism to democratic voting. Collective decision-making in animal groups is less well understood, although examples are ubiquitous: a honeybee colony picks a new location for the hive; a monkey troop invades a neighboring territory; a flock of birds changes its roost site. Theoretical models have been developed to predict the conditions under which such decisions should be shared, and how the structure and stability of the social group might influence the speed and accuracy of these decisions. However, experimental studies on wild animals are rare, leaving gaps between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence. This project explores these gaps in a tropical bird, the greater ani. Anis nest in social groups composed of several pairs, which build a single nest in which all of the females lay their eggs. The choice of where to build the nest is a crucial decision, since its location determines its exposure to predators. The project combines field experiments, behavioral observations, and tracking techniques to test how groups arrive at shared decisions - and, crucially, which opinions prevail when group members disagree. This project will provide research experiences to students and a postdoctoral researcher, training to Panamanian researchers through a series of public workshops, and outreach to the public through a partnership with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. <br/><br/>This project explores three major questions about collective decision-making that have arisen from recent theoretical work. First, do shared decisions become less democratic as delays in decision-making grow more costly? Second, can a well-informed minority exert disproportionate influence over group decisions? Third, how does social network structure affect the equality, speed, and accuracy of collective decisions? The research plan leverages a long-term (>10-year) data set on greater anis in Panama, which live in groups containing multiple unrelated breeding pairs. Some groups are remarkably stable, consisting of the same members for over a decade; whereas others consist of a mix of experienced individuals and newcomers. Anis show close affiliative relationships with other group members who are not their mates, and prior research has found that the duration of these relationships affects coordinated behaviors. In this project, conflicts of preference between group members will be created by manipulating nest-site quality and the information available to different individuals. This will enable hypothesis testing of how group members arrive at collective decisions when their opinions conflict, how individuals communicate preferences, and whether the presence of well-informed individuals changes the outcome of collective decisions.  Knowledge of individual life histories and natural variation in group stability, combined with RFID tracking data on interactions between group members, will reveal how social network structure affects the process and outcome of collective decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments will be carried out to determine how changes in skull development alter one of the most useful biomechanical abilities to ever evolve: Jaw protrusion. One third of living vertebrates belong to two fish lineages that independently evolved the ability to project their upper jaws forward from the face during feeding. These two lineages have remarkably similar protrusion mechanisms and in both cases small changes in upper jaw shape dramatically alter protrusion distance. Fishes with extensive protrusion occupy different ecological niches than those that have limited protrusion due to specialization on different food types. Jaw protrusion does not appear until late development, usually after a pronounced metamorphosis. Thyroid hormone signaling is a major regulator of both metamorphosis and bone formation. Preliminary data demonstrate that changes in thyroid hormone levels can have pronounced effects on the development of protrusion ability. Very little is known about the controls of cranial formation during late development, yet it is during this period that most organisms begin to remodel their bodies in ways that allow them to occupy their adult ecological niches. This project has the potential to illuminate a developmental period of extreme evolutionary significance that has not yet received much investigative attention. This research is being performed in collaboration with a high-school biology teacher-scientist. Aspects of the work are being incorporated in to all units of their biology course and students are performing a study of fish skull development in the classroom<br/><br/>Fish jaw protrusion during feeding is linked to extraordinary evolutionary success. This study will further integrate the fields of evolutionary functional morphology and developmental biology by investigating the late-developmental controls of skull morphogenesis. A great deal is known about the evolution of skull mechanics, but most studies have examined adult specimens. There is also a large literature on skull development, but most studies have examined early life stages. Adult cranial mechanics arise during juvenile to adult transitions in late development, so understanding the developmental factors that have shaped skull evolution requires study of this time period.  Preliminary data indicate that juvenile diet and thyroid hormone signaling are important determinants of protrusion ability via their affects on the formation of the premaxillary bone. Premaxilla shape determines maximum protrusion ability. This project will investigate the developmental determinants of premaxilla shape variation in order to better understand the evolvability of jaw protrusion. Research will examine the developmental controls of jaw protrusion in the zebrafish and two closely related species with different protrusion abilities. This project has the following aims: 1) to determine if thyroid hormone production affects the development of zebrafish jaw protrusion; 2) to determine if feeding on biomechanically different diets affects protrusion development in the zebrafish and two closely related species; 3) to determine if altered thyroid hormone production affects mRNA expression levels in developing zebrafish jaws; and 4) to identify genetic loci associated with jaw protrusion ability."

There has been an increased understanding of the bacteria that are associated with specific animal hosts, but the proceses and mechanisms by which specific animals become colonized with characteristic beneficial bacteria and avoid colonization by harmful (pathogenic) bacteria are not well-understood. This project uses a simplified system in which an animal organ is colonized by only a single bacterial species as a way to examine these processes and mechanisms. Molecular genetic approaches will be used to identify bacterial genes and processes that are critical to host colonization, and comparative approaches will be used to determine how the gene circuits in different bacteria evolve to either keep the same animal partner or allow the bacteria to switch and colonize a new animal host. This work has the potential to impact studies of bacterial aggregation, a process that occurs readily and has broad implications for the ability of bacteria to perform beneficial or harmful functions in natural and man-made environments. Climate change has been shown to influence bacterial-animal associations, so a deeper understanding of the molecular basis to these interactions will allow us to better prepare for changing environmental conditions. Finally, the evolution of infectious diseases depends on pathogen interactions with animal hosts, and therefore it is critical to discern regulatory changes that influence microbe-host communication. Students will be trained in modern genetics and genomics, and bioinformatics to address ""big data"" questions. Outreach activities are focused on broadening the representation of future STEM field leaders. <br/><br/>Microbial symbioses are prevalent in animals and are crucial to the health and development of both partners. These relationships have evolved robust mechanisms to ensure the faithful transmission of symbionts during each new host generation. This project applies modern genomic and genetic methods to examine how host specificity develops in a horizontally transmitted animal-microbe symbiosis. The project focuses on the binary association between Vibrio fischeri bacteria and the bobtail squid hosts. Preliminary data have revealed the importance of biofilm formation (bacterial aggregation) during host colonization, both in V. fischeri colonization of squid and in many bacterial colonization systems. In the canonical squid symbiont ES114, the RscS histidine kinase activates biofilm genes that are necessary for normal host colonization. A comparative approach identified strains that do not use RscS for colonization, and in the project molecular genetic approaches will be undertaken to identify the signal transduction pathways regulating aggregation and colonization in closely related symbiont strains. By taking an integrative approach that encompasses natural populations, genomes, pathways, and genes, the project will yield an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that maintain symbiont-host fidelity and facilitate co-evolutionary dynamics in horizontally-transmitted bacterial symbionts. A pilot workshop is proposed that integrates with the research aims and trains undergraduate and graduate students in modern bioinformatics techniques."

This project studies changes in behavioral decisions, communication signals, heat and cold tolerance, and population structure over 10 years in natural and experimental populations of swordtail fish, a longstanding model in genetics, physiology, and behavior.  The two parent species are found at high and low elevations, hybrids at intermediate elevations.  Experimental populations will seed first-generation hybrids along an elevation gradient.  The predicted response at the high elevation site is that genes associated with cold tolerance will spread along with the communication signals and behavioral biases of the high-elevation species, and vice-versa at the low elevation site. The study will identify novel genes involved with decision-making, communication, and temperature tolerance, which may lead to applications in medicine and agriculture.  Further, the data will address the extent to which specific, identifiable parts of the genome are responsible for adaptation to various environments.

This project seeks to test the emancipation hypothesis proposed by Tinbergen 60 years ago to understand how a novel behavior arises by using a hybrid zone between two species of hummingbirds. The novel behavior is a courtship display that is performed by one species, Allen's Hummingbird, and not the other, Rufous Hummingbird. In this stereotyped display, called the 'pendulum display', the male flies back and forth over a female while producing distinctive sounds with his wings. The investigators will record displays from 400 birds from within a hybrid zone between these two species, and then search for genes associated with individual components of the behavior, by sequencing the genomes of these 400 birds. Understanding how one behavior splits into two will reveal a fundamental mechanism of how behavior evolves.  Additionally, this grant will train of students of diverse backgrounds, and enable outreach to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside by funding purchase of an 'acoustic camera', allowing deaf children to learn more about sound through this newly invented way of visualizing it. <br/><br/>As the genetic underpinnings of how one behavior splits into two 'paramorphs', alternate forms of a previously unitary character, have not been demonstrated for any behavior, the analyses presented here aim to do so for the first time. This 3-year study has three objectives: (1) Hybrid zone mapping and cline analysis: phenotype, genotype, and selection (2): Sequence analysis of complex display behavior, and (3): Admixture mapping of behavior and morphology. Together these objectives will provide information about selection on the display traits of interest, and test the paramorph hypothesis directly, using phenotypic and genotypic data respectively. Current data indicate no fixed genetic differences between the species within coding regions of the genome, hinting that the paramorphic behavior could be driven by differences in gene regulation between the two species, rather than as the result of a paralogous gene.  Just as the modern view of morphological diversity was transformed by the study of its genetic basis, a direct assessment of the genes underlying a behavior that varies across a hybrid zone will allow one of the first tests of how a complex motor pattern has evolved. This project will build infrastructure through addition of sound, video, and specimens to the Macaulay Library at Cornell University, San Diego Natural History Museum and the SDSU Museum of Biodiversity."

Recent studies have shown that both fern fronds (the vegetative generation) and fern gametophytes (the sexual generation) have evolved numerous strategies to cope with and recover from severe drought stress. This research investigates the water relations of both stages of the fern lifecycle to test the hypothesis that the evolution of traits typically related to drought tolerance promoted the expansion of ferns from largely moist, terrestrial habitats to drier, sunnier canopy habitats. The research will focus on drought tolerant traits of two recent fern lineages, which represent the bulk of tropical fern species diversity. Physiological, morphological and anatomical attributes will be examined across select species in the field and in the laboratory. This basic research will not only expand knowledge of the processes that shape biological diversity, but also potentially identify novel plant traits that could assist with the development of more drought resistant agricultural species. Students will receive international research experiences in Mexico and Costa Rica, and student/instructor exchanges will promote research collaboration.

Experiments will test resistance to hydraulic failure by drought-induced air entry, leaf turgor loss points, and relate these data to numerous anatomical and morphological traits. Lastly, complementary studies looking at the desiccation tolerance of gametopytes in this group will be conducted. The results will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework, which will explicitly test for correlated trait evolution in both sporophytes and gametophytes."

Differences in the relative sizes and shapes of body parts are among the most distinguishing features that define species, and understanding how these differences come about is of compelling interest to the study of developmental and evolutionary biology. This symposium will be held in Tampa, Florida, in January 2019, at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. The symposium will provide a platform to facilitate conversation between junior and senior career scientists and will foster novel integrative collaborations between evolutionary biologists, developmental biologists, and physiologists. The symposium will feature the state-of-the-art investigation of morphological allometry, showcasing cutting-edge tools and a diverse array of study systems. By bringing together researchers specializing in diverse species, ranging from insects to mammals and plants, with participants of diverse technical expertise and research emphases, the symposium and its publications will contribute to a deeper understanding of allometry by providing an integrative synthesis of evolutionary and developmental phenomena. The mix of attendees will allow early career people to interact closely with more senior ones, and, in particular, it will place graduate students in a position to develop professional networks and connect with potential scientific mentors. <br/><br/>Until recently, the study of allometry was mostly descriptive, and consisted of a diversity of methods for fitting regressions to bivariate or multivariate morphometric data. During the past decade, researchers have been developing methods to extract biological information from allometric data that could be used to deduce the underlying mechanisms that gave rise to the allometry. In addition, an increasing effort has gone into understanding the kinetics of growth and the regulatory mechanisms that control growth of the body and its component parts. Although there is general agreement about the new goals for the study of allometry (understanding underlying mechanisms and how those evolve to produce different morphologies), progress is hindered by lack of coordination among the different approaches. This stems from the fact that different investigators arrived at the problem from different disciplines (genetics, cell biology, evolution, development, comparative morphology, statistics), armed with different technical and conceptual approaches. The time is now right for a rapid and coordinated push to take understanding of the causes and consequences of allometry to a wholly new level, by integrating this diverse body of information about genetic, cellular, and physiological mechanisms of growth and morphogenesis into a new research program that embraces diversity of approach. In order to do this diverse practitioners must interact with each other. That is the main purpose of the symposium: to forge new functional, conceptual, and collaborative connections among established and novice practitioners selected to represent a diversity of perspectives. Symposium papers and a synthetic overview paper will be disseminated by publication in the journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neurons are the most well-known; they communicate with each other by generating spikes of electrical activity. The second cell type, glial cells, play a variety of roles that are less well understood. In the awake adult brain, the overall spiking activity of neurons appears random. However, in deep sleep or under anesthesia, the spiking activity pattern becomes synchronized within and between various brain regions. During brain development, this type of synchronous spiking is thought to be necessary for the circuit maturation, and the establishment and maintenance of the functional organization of the brain. The focus of this research is to understand the role of one type of glial cell (astrocytes) in the emergence of synchronous spiking activity patterns in the developing brain. The main hypothesis is that astrocytes play a decisive role in the synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain. Preliminary data has demonstrated that astrocytes are necessary for synchronization of spiking activity; the proposed research will elucidate the molecular pathways within astrocytes that control the synchronization of spiking in surrounding neurons. The results of this research will identify fundamental mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions that shape synchronous activity during brain development. This project is conducted at a Historically Black University, and will immerse minority students in cutting edge neuroscience research, and foster peer-mentoring based on interactions between undergraduate and graduate researchers.<br/><br/>Preliminary data using mixed neuron and astrocyte cultures on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) showed random spiking activity which synchronized over time, in comparison to astrocyte-free neuronal cultures, which only show random activity without synchronization. The main hypothesis of this research is that astrocytic release of glutamate mediated by the mGluR1 G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathway mediates the effects of astrocytes on the development of neuronal synchronous activity. A model for the mechanism by which the astrocyte mGluR1 pathway mediates neuronal synchronization will be tested using several different dominant negative constructs. A dominant-negative mGluR1 receptor that blocks downstream signaling will be used to understand this signaling pathway's role in both population synchrony, and in the temporal relationship between calcium oscillations within astrocytes and the development of neuronal synchronous bursts.  A dominant-negative SNARE protein Vamp2/Syb2 will be used to block glutamate release from astrocytes. The role of the mGluR1 pathway and mGluR1 mediated glutamate release in the development of synchrony will also be examined in vivo. The strength of this project is the combination of multi-electrode electrophysiology, molecular dissection of the mGluR1 pathway in astrocytes, and computational analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ant transportation systems, common among beneficial and pest species, are similar to human transportation systems in many ways. Like subway systems and road networks, their goal is to move resources and individuals quickly and efficiently from place to place. Having alternative routes within a transportation system can make travel faster and more reliable, especially following disruptions or backlogs on particular routes. Yet extra routes cost additional resources. Designing an efficient and reliable transportation system at minimal cost is a difficult problem even for human engineers, who can take a system-wide perspective. Ant colonies, in contrast, build their transportation networks with no central vision or overarching plan. Certain species are nonetheless able to create systems that are remarkably reliable, efficient, and low-cost. This research will develop a new framework to explain how ant colonies create such well-functioning transportation systems via a process of gradual modification rather than design. Undergraduates, graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers will be mentored as part of an interdisciplinary, international team. High school students from groups underrepresented in STEM will be mentored by undergraduates with guidance from the PIs. This research could help inspire new management strategies for invasive ant pests, and new design algorithms for human transportation systems. Results will be shared with the public via a series of short films, exhibits and presentations at Florida state parks, and an established undergraduate-authored blog.<br/><br/>Despite the ubiquity of biological and human-engineered transportation networks, there is no unifying framework for predicting how they respond dynamically and adaptively to external pressures in a way that balances infrastructure cost, transportation efficiency, and robustness. The central objective of the project is to develop a general theory for how environmental constraints and opportunities shape dynamic transportation networks, emphasizing the interactions between network structure and function. A generative agent-based network approach will be used to create a general model of dynamic transportation networks. The model will explore how networks respond effectively to environmental challenges via processes of dynamic network restructuring that operate under a range of ecological constraints. The model will be parameterized and tested initially with existing data for terrestrial wood-ant networks, and refined based on the results. Predictions will then be generated by the model for the substantially different region of the parameter space occupied by arboreal turtle ants, and tested with new field data on turtle ant network structure and usage. Finally, the model will be challenged with field and laboratory experiments using turtle ants, where the dynamic response of their transportation network will be tracked following changes to resource distributions, disturbance patterns, and spatial constraints. The project targets the development of theory with the potential to unify research on dynamic transportation networks across biological systems, with possible applications to a variety of natural and human problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gene expression is the production of RNA copies of these discrete DNA sections that are then either used to encode for proteins, or are functional as RNAs in their own right. Gene annotations identify and characterize the location of genes throughout a complete genome sequence. Annotations of protein-coding genes have received a great deal of attention, and are at a relatively advanced state for many plant species of agricultural and economic interest. In contrast, annotations for many other types of genes are much less developed. Regulatory small RNAs are short bits of RNA that function to turn off the expression of other genes in the genome and have been implicated as key players in several important plant traits, including disease resistance, tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, and plant growth traits affecting yield. One sub-type of regulatory small RNA genes, the microRNAs, are well-studied and well-annotated. However, microRNAs account for a very small fraction of the overall small RNA gene population in plants; preliminary data indicate that a typical plant genome has just a few hundred microRNA genes, but tens of thousands of genes encoding other types of regulatory small RNAs. This project seeks to provide systematic annotations of plant genes that produce all types regulatory small RNAs for several plants of agricultural and societal interest, including rice, maize, tomato, and apple.<br/><br/>Knowing where in the genome the genes are, and what types of products they produce, is key information for genetic approaches to plant improvement.  Regulatory small RNAs are clearly a major type of gene in plants, but their annotation is currently under-developed. Systematic and reliable gene annotations for regulatory small RNA genes will accelerate genetic, genomic, and breeding experiments to identify superior plant varieties to meet the challenge of feeding a growing population and maintaining the astounding productivity of American agriculture in the face of a changing climate.

Bladderwort is also among the smallest suction feeders, sucking planktonic prey into millimeter-sized underwater traps.  Bladderwort are interesting not just for their speed and small size, but because their feeding mode is also the most common found in fish, from larva to adult.  Yet current understanding suggests that suction feeding is less suitable for small organisms such as fish larvae - small suction feeders experience water as viscous, which seriously limits suction speed and increases the energetic costs of suction.  Fish larvae are known to have a low success rate at capturing prey and hence suffer high mortality from starvation, which in turn is a main factor limiting recruitment and adult fish population size.This study aims to identify the lower size limit of suction feeding.  This study will lead not just to a better understanding of suction feeding in small organisms, but might also help to address the high mortality of larval fish.  <br/><br/>To study suction feeding in small organisms, students will conduct experiments on bladderwort to discover how suction feeders as small or even smaller than larval fish capture their prey.  Students will build mathematical and robotic models to explore what limits capture success.  The goal is to identify the morphological features and flow mechanisms that allow small organisms to suction feed.  By combining data sets on bladderwort from Fresno State, students with data sets on larval fish and tadpoles from collaborating universities, this study will then compare the morphological and flow features of all three organisms to explore how far plants and animals have developed converging solutions.  The research within this study will be conducted at a minority-serving institution. It will be integrated not only into undergraduate and Master's thesis research projects, but also into several undergraduate courses to enable roughly 2000 students per year to conduct authentic research as part of their course work."

Thus, sequence-indexed collections of single insertions are critical resources for elucidating gene function in organisms with sequenced genomes and are deemed essential by the community to fully exploit the maize genome sequence.  It has recently become feasible to combine high-throughput sequencing with multi-dimensional pooling strategies to sequence and index hundreds of new insertions at a time.  This work will complete the production of a reverse genetics resource based on the transposon Ds that will enable the community to generate and build up a single-gene knockout resource for maize. Specifically, the work will: (1) characterize the transposition frequency of 78 single Ds-GFP (or Ds*) launching platforms generated by Agrobacterium transformation during the previous grant period and map them to the genome.  Highly active platforms will be identified and deposited in the Stock Center to complement the 82 already mapped.  These platforms will allow visual selection of transpositions from many regions of the genome and, thus, enable researchers to create regional gene knock-out collections;  (2) generate collections of 480 Ds* transpositions each from 24 Ds* launching platforms located on all 10 chromosomes which, together with the 9 collections currently at hand, will serve as the foundation for a Ds*-based maize single-gene knockout resource;  and (3) sequence-index these collections by high throughput MiSeq Illumina sequencing of 3-D DNA pools.  To this end, a specific software package (InsertionMapper) was developed to extract Ds* transposon junctions from the large amount of sequencing data and map them to the maize genome.<br/><br/>This project will integrate high throughput sequencing at Rutgers with bioinformatic sequence analysis at Montclair State University, a predominantly undergraduate institution in NJ.  MSU students will annotate all Ds*-adjacent sequences generated by the NextGen sequencer.  The project will provide informatics and molecular biology students at that institution with the opportunity to participate directly in maize research and fulfill their independent research requirement for graduation.  Students at both Rutgers and MSU will work in the project as summer interns in the molecular biology lab and maize genetics nursery of the PI.  The PI and coPI are members of underrepresented groups and have a record of fruitful prior collaborations.  They have collaborated in previous NSF PGRP-funded projects which led to the development of a bioinformatics tool and the publication of three joint papers.

While rodent-based, germ-free animal models are most commonly used, they are expensive (>$200/individual) to maintain and use, severely constraining research into finding causative links between gut bacteria and healthy or diseased host states to a few, well-funded research groups. The proposed work establishes the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as low-cost (<$1/individual) germ-free model system for conducting hypothesis-driven investigations into microbial community-host interactions at the gut interface. Germ-free P. americana is a useful complementary experimental platform because it shares many of the same gut bacteria found in mammals, many of whom are cultivable, and exhibits many of the same digestive and developmental abnormalities observed in germ-free rodents. The proposed work will reintroduce endemic gut bacteria via fecal transplants and artificial assemblages of cultivated bacteria to identify species that elicit normal development and growth. Future work will exploit P. americana's inherent omnivory to examine how human diets impact gut bacterial dynamics and subsequent host gastric health and development. Furthermore, high-achieving undergraduates from Howard University will be partnered with Ohio State University postdocs and graduate students to participate in proposed activities as summer research assistants and the PI will give contributed talks at historically black universities and Hispanic serving institutions to actively promote academic research careers and recruit high-achieving undergraduates for the Ohio State University summer research opportunities program.<br/><br/>The gut epithelium is among the few sites in which host, microbes and the environment converge with significant evolutionary and ecological consequences. Prevention and therapeutic responses to digestive diseases are well-informed by a detailed understanding of how normal or healthy states emerge and are maintained, and thus efforts to understand how gut microbes contribute to normal gut development is also of significant interest. The contributions of bacterial species to gut health can be challenging because gut communities are comprised of many species with overlapping functional abilities. Germ-free rodent models are often used because they can be inoculated with desired bacteria and then host conditions can be assessed. Unfortunately, germ-free rodents are expensive to maintain and use (>$200/individual) and this limits research into finding causative links between gut bacteria and healthy or diseased host states. The proposed work seeks to establish the utility of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as an experimental platform for detailing microbial community-host interactions at the gut interface and to provide low-cost (<$1/roach), alternative tools for hypothesis-testing and robust preliminary data collection. Germ-free P. americana (GF-PA) can be reared without antibiotics and substantial preliminary data indicates that many of the gut structural and cellular abnormalities associated with germ-free rodents are observed. The proposed work will build on and use this new experimental microbiome research tool kit to 1) identify gut symbionts critical for gut structural and digestive development and 2) detect host gene products differentially expressed in gut tissues in the presence of gut symbionts."

Recent studies have shown that both fern fronds (the vegetative generation) and fern gametophytes (the sexual generation) have evolved numerous strategies to cope with and recover from severe drought stress. This research investigates the water relations of both stages of the fern lifecycle to test the hypothesis that the evolution of traits typically related to drought tolerance promoted the expansion of ferns from largely moist, terrestrial habitats to drier, sunnier canopy habitats. The research will focus on drought tolerant traits of two recent fern lineages, which represent the bulk of tropical fern species diversity. Physiological, morphological and anatomical attributes will be examined across select species in the field and in the laboratory. This basic research will not only expand knowledge of the processes that shape biological diversity, but also potentially identify novel plant traits that could assist with the development of more drought resistant agricultural species. Students will receive international research experiences in Mexico and Costa Rica, and student/instructor exchanges will promote research collaboration. Outreach activities to the public will combine with non-profit collaborators at the Save the Redwood League and the Southern Madison Heritage Trust to illustrate the important role of ferns and other non-vascular plants in the ecology of natural plant communities. <br/><br/>In order to determine whether drought stress exerts strong, convergent selection pressure on fern sporophytes and gametophytes, this research will examine the desiccation tolerance of gametophytes from numerous species in the Pteridaceae. The Pteridaceae are a hyper-diverse family of ferns that are ancestral to the Eupolypods, and the results from this study will complement an existing data set documenting drought tolerance in the Pteridaceae sporophytes. A second set of studies will examine the drought tolerance of epiphytic and terrestrial Eupolypod sporophytes. Experiments will test resistance to hydraulic failure by drought-induced air entry, leaf turgor loss points, and relate these data to numerous anatomical and morphological traits. Lastly, complementary studies looking at the desiccation tolerance of gametopytes in this group will be conducted. The results will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework, which will explicitly test for correlated trait evolution in both sporophytes and gametophytes."

It is hypothesized that the great diversity of mammalian species resulted from the evolution of structures associated with an ability to access, consume and process new food resources. However, this hypothesis has not been tested for the majority of mammal groups, and therefore the question of how mammalian diversity arose remains an important, unanswered one. This project will employ a suite of modern tools in the study of anatomy and physical forces associated with feeding (such as skull or cranial anatomy, and chewing or masticatory muscles) to test this hypothesis in three of the most species-rich and ecologically diverse mammal groups: bats, carnivores and primates. The research will generate unprecedented quantitative datasets on the masticatory muscles and the three-dimensional skull anatomy of over 100 species. The researchers will explore the links between these anatomical and functional (internal) factors with external factors (such as food characteristics and diversity) as a way to understand patterns of species diversification. Through this work, the project will create a large public database of mammal 3D cranial morphology, train a diverse group of students, disseminate results through a public museum exhibit, and establish cross-disciplinary collaborations among several young investigators.<br/><br/>Morphological and functional adaptations are important drivers of ecological diversification across the Tree of Life. Within mammals, it is hypothesized that many radiations were enabled by the evolution of morphological and functional traits that provided access to new dietary adaptive zones, but quantitative tests of this hypothesis are lacking for the broad diversity of mammals. This gap is partly rooted on the extensive lack of comparative datasets that integrate both the osteological and myological components of the feeding apparatus. These data, which currently exist for less than 2% of mammalian taxa, are critically needed both for an understanding of mammalian masticatory physiology and for the application of diversification analyses that contrast the relative influences of intrinsic versus extrinsic drivers of mammalian radiation. The proposed work will test macroevolutionary hypotheses about ecological diversification by generating the largest comparative datasets to date on the three-dimensional morphology, function and performance of the mammalian feeding apparatus. The team will couple micro-Computed Tomography, gross dissections, geometric morphometric analyses and biomechanical modeling to produce these data across three species-rich and ecologically diverse mammal clades (bats, carnivorans and primates). Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be used to test hypotheses about the influence of dietary selective regimes on the evolution of cranial morphology, function and performance, and their association with lineage diversification. The organismal aspect of the research will illuminate the biomechanics and ecomorphological diversity in mammal groups that are of broad scientific interest. This study will help elucidate the potential drivers of diversification in these groups while creating a foundation for further research on the physiology, biomechanics and evolution of mammal feeding."

Biomedical research has traditionally focused on how shifts in diet and physical activity affect metabolism in mammalian model organisms such as rats and mice. While these two factors are known to be significant, there is very little information on other conditions that can cause or contribute to metabolic disease. The range of animal species that can develop metabolic disease is also unknown. The investigators recently demonstrated that diabetes and obesity are not unique to mammals and occur in natural populations of dragonflies as a consequence of gut infection by a protozoan parasite. Preliminary data indicate that the level of acidity in water bodies that dragonflies inhabit is a strong predictor of rates of infection and therefore, metabolic disease in the dragonfly species. The role of infection in the development of metabolic disease is poorly understood in any animal system. This project represents a unique opportunity to provide new ecological and physiological insights and will allow in-depth studies on this problem. This integrative project will experimentally link natural variation in water acidity, dragonfly gut microbiome composition and parasitic infection susceptibility to dragonfly metabolic and other performance phenotypes. This work will underline the importance of environmental factors to metabolic disease. This project also has broad relevance given the growing prevalence of natural insect-protozoan parasite interactions that cause disease in humans (e.g. malaria, toxoplasmosis) and in species of economic importance (e.g. honey bees, bumblebees) to humans. <br/><br/>The causative role of infection in the development of metabolic disease such as obesity is poorly understood in any animal system. The project proposes to conduct experiments that will extend previous work on this dragonfly host-parasite interaction and provide novel insights into the ecophysiology of infection-related metabolic disease in an insect. Based on new ecological and physiological data from this system, these studies will examine the hypotheses that both environmental pH and chemical interactions of parasite and gut microbiota are important drivers of susceptibility to infection, and its escalation into metabolic disease and reduced fitness in the dragonfly host. The investigator will 1) use full factorial treatment designs to examine effects of environmental (water) pH and exposure to infectious spores on larval and host gut microbiome composition and parasite load, 2) determine infection effects on flight muscle performance and fuel use during high intensity flight behavior (field high speed videography, in situ work loop and respiratory quotient assays), and 3) assess the extent of host manipulation by the parasite through examination of systemic immunity in healthy and infected adults, in response to parasite excretory/secretory products and to heat-inactivated bacterial cultures."

Within the body cavity, or hemocoel, hemocytes either circulate with the hemolymph (insect blood) or exist as sessile cells (attached to tissues).  Earlier experiments revealed that during the course of an infection, pathogens accumulate on the surface of the heart of adult mosquitoes.  Examination of the pericardium then showed that a small population of sessile hemocytes exists in the regions that flank the valves of the heart (the periostial regions), and that these hemocytes readily phagocytose pathogens.  Infection induces the recruitment of additional hemocytes to the periostial regions, and these hemocytes rapidly kill pathogens via phagocytosis, melanization and lysis.  Currently there is a paucity of data on the effect of hemolymph circulation on immune responses, and on the role sessile hemocytes play in controlling infection.  Thus, significant gaps exist in understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogen resistance in the insect hemocoel.  This research will explore the biology of a newly discovered immune tissue in mosquitoes (periostial hemocytes) that fundamentally relies on the mechanics of the heart for pathogen killing.  More specifically, this project will investigate the molecular, spatial, and temporal bases of infection-induced hemocyte aggregation on the surface of the insect heart.  The project will yield critical insight into the anti-pathogen responses of insects, and will integrate this information into a broad conceptual framework on insect immunity, physiology, and development.  Furthermore, this research will be carried out in mosquitoes, a socially and ecologically important insect group because of their role as pests and pathogen transmitters.  Thus, data arising from this project could contribute to the development of novel pest and disease control strategies. In addition, the principal investigator will partner with Gower Elementary School (Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools) to introduce elementary school students to insect biology.<br/><br/>This project has four primary objectives that collectively aim to decipher the physiological interaction between the mosquito immune and circulatory systems.  Objective 1 will employ molecular and imaging methodologies to determine the pathways that drive the infection-induced migration of hemocytes to the surface of the heart.  Objective 2 will rely on molecular and biochemical approaches to test whether during the course of an infection hemocyte-produced factors such as nitric oxide modulate cardiac physiology.  Objective 3 will determine whether the interaction between the immune and circulatory systems is conserved during mosquito development.  Specifically, because the general body plan as well as the flow of hemolymph are markedly different in the adult and larval life stages, objective 3 will employ organismal and imaging approaches to assess whether the immune and circulatory systems of larvae also interact during the course of an infection.  If they do, the nature of that interaction will be defined.  Finally, objective 4 will assess whether periostial hemocyte aggregation is a general feature by quantitatively measuring the occurrence of this response in a wide variety of insect species.  It is expected that this research will uncover fundamental physiological interactions between the immune system and the circulatory system of insects."

We now know individuals may benefit from cooperation in several ways, but mechanisms underlying decisions to cooperate and variation in the amount of cooperation remain incompletely understood.  The lance-tailed manakin provides an excellent opportunity to investigate why individuals vary in cooperative behavior, and how cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors coexist.  Males of this tropical bird cooperate with non-relatives in coordinated courtship displays, but only dominant alphas mate.  Some males serve long terms (6+ years) as non-breeding betas, while others become alphas without ever being betas.  Both highly cooperative and non-cooperative males breed once alpha, but males cooperating for the average number of years have low alpha success.  This project will assess the role of territory quality, genetic variability, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategies on beta male behavior. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral trainees will all be involved in lab and field work in the U.S. and Panama.   This work integrates research and education by (1) implementing an international field course for undergraduates that combines involvement in long-term research with student-designed projects; (2) hosting three undergraduates for REU projects in Panama; (3) developing outreach exercises for 4th-6th graders; (4) publishing educational resources and establishing an associated webcam; and (5) establishing an educational display on the field site, visited by 8000-10,000 tourists/yr.  <br/><br/>This project investigates mechanisms underlying behavioral variation in cooperation in the lance-tailed manakin.  It assesses the role of ecological constraints, experimentally quantifying effects of territory quality on beta behavior, and tests three complementary hypotheses explaining the occurrence of disruptive selection:  genetic variability, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging in unpredictable environments.  The project quantifies additive genetic variance in cooperation using animal models on behavioral histories of pedigreed males.  Effects of individual phenotype on life history and cooperation are investigated by measuring the relationships of condition, stress responsiveness, and telomeres (repeated nucleotides on chromosome ends, implicated as bioindicators of physiological state).  Measures of lifetime siring success will yield insights about whether cooperators reduce variance in lifetime reproductive output.  The project will train one postdoctoral researcher, at least one graduate student, and 15 postgraduates in field, laboratory, and analytical techniques.  This project provides insight into both the function of cooperation by delayed direct benefits and the forces underlying disruptive selection on behavioral phenotypes.

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Aaron R. Leichty is ""Characterization of Genetic Regulatory Networks Controlling Bifacial and Unifacial Leaf Morphology in Legumes"". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Davis and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Neelima Sinha.<br/><br/>The morphology of a leaf impacts plant physiology, which in turn determines where a plant can grow and reproduce. Plants adapted to arid environments often have leaves with morphological traits that are not found in plants that grow in wetter environments. This project examines the development of a striking adaptation to arid environments: the leaves of many woody legumes are vertically oriented and radially or vertically symmetric. Examining the similarities and differences in genetic regulatory networks underlying the leaves of major legume crops and the leaves of woody legumes may allow for the engineering of crops better adapted to a warmer, dryer, more variable climate. Training objectives include comparative developmental genomics, systems biology, bioinformatics, and gene expression and regulation in legumes.  Broader impacts will include training opportunities for undergraduates and high school students and development of high school curriculum related to plant molecular biology, husbandry, and tissue culture. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to determine how bifacial and unifacial leaves develop in legumes. To determine how each leaf type is constructed, laser capture microdissection will be used to sample a series of developmental stages very early in leaf morphogenesis, when leaf identity and polarity are specified. These samples will be used for RNA-seq and the resulting data will be used to construct gene co-expression networks. Bioinformatic analyses will be used to identify important communities in the resulting networks. Communities from bifacial and unifacial networks will be compared to identify conserved components of each leaf type across species. Molecular and reverse genetic techniques will be used to validate the resulting networks. Specifically, transient and stable transformation will be used to perturb key genes in the identified genetic regulatory networks to confirm differences in regulatory connections within Acacia and Medicago. For the most promising genes, their unifacial expression pattern will be emulated in Medicago to see how easily bifacial development can be transformed into a unifacial-like morphology. The findings of this research will be shared publicly through presentation and publication.

Products of grape cultivation (table grapes, raisins, juice, wine and oil) have a value of $5.76 billion at the farm gate and an estimated $162 billion annually to the American economy. The viticulture industry has grown steadily over the past decade, but grape cultivation faces new and continuing challenges from diseases and abiotic stresses.  Grape cultivation relies heavily on wild North American species for rootstocks, and that reliance is expanding.  This project will allow researchers to determine the genetic composition of four wild grape species from the Southwest that are used, or have demonstrated promise, for grape breeding. The project will gather information about the ability of these species to resist Pierces Disease, it will generate new information about plant biology, genomics, and evolution, and it will make Vitis one of the best-studied botanical genera. Data obtained from this project will help worldwide grape breeding programs and will be available through a community resource, allowing the project investigators to share their research with members of the public and the wine and grape industries.

This project aims to make Vitis a leading perennial model for comparative genomics, landscape genomics and association genomics. It will also further understanding of the basic biology of resistance to Pierces Disease, which is critical for the sustainability of viticulture. Researchers will assay hundreds of natural accessions to identify plants with resistance and study the geographic distribution of resistance in nature. They will complement phenotypic assays with whole genome resequencing (WGS) data to identify signatures of local adaptation, study the phylogenomics of the genus, and associate genetic variation with climatic variables. They will also employ analyses that aim to uncover important basic information about candidate genes and the genetic architecture underlying abiotic and biotic stress responses. An additional goal is to generate reference genomes for four North American Vitis species that have been used in rootstock breeding; currently, no reference genomes exist for any North American Vitis species. These genomes will be a valuable community resource, facilitate interspecific analyses, form the basis for inferring the pace and pattern of structural rearrangements during species diversification, and aid the identification of homologous and syntenous regions between V. vinifera and its congeners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumers need and want healthier, better tasting foods than those produced by today's typical production systems focused on quantity rather than quality. This project focuses on tomato, the most economically important fruit/vegetable crop worldwide. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the genetic mechanisms controlling plant responses to environmental stresses such as drought and to understand how the environment influences the endogenous chemistry of flavor and nutritional qualities in tomato. This research will deliver mechanistic knowledge as well as tangible tools for agronomic and quality improvement of tomato and other crops. Specifically, naturally occurring versions of genes permitting more robust responses to abiotic stress and positively impacting flavor and nutritional quality will be identified and disseminated to public and private breeders so as to inform their selection processes. The effectiveness of these resources and the significance of the knowledge acquired will ensure that the project contributes directly to food security and sustainable fruit cultivation through use of currently untapped genetic information residing in underutilized wild tomato varieties. With regard to outreach and training, the project will provide unique cross-training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scientists on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition, the project will provide summer research internships in genomics and bioinformatics for undergraduate students from Fort Valley State, California State University, Fresno and California State University, Sacramento, all minority serving institutions. <br/> <br/>The twin objectives of this project are to determine the importance of transcriptional regulation of the metabolic pathways defining quality traits in tomato and to identify such transcriptional regulators at the molecular level. The selected quality traits include those determining antioxidant capacity that impacts shelf life and nutritional value as well as those determining fruit flavor. Loci contributing to abiotic stress tolerance will also be identified with the goal of developing more nutritious and sustainable crops. Natural variation available in introgression lines (ILs) resulting from wild species crosses to tomato will be used to assess the importance of transcriptional regulation, identify regulatory genes and assess epigenetic variation. To accomplish these ends, resources that include a genome reference sequence for S. lycopersicoides and metabolite, DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of IL fruit will be developed and made freely available. Deliverables include regulatory gene identification and new tools for metabolic engineering of fruit quality. This collaborative US-EU project will allow development of tools and resources on a scale unavailable at a national level. All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, sequence based datasets will be accessible through a consortium database as well as through publicly available data repositories including GenBank, European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and the SOL Genomics Network (SGN)."

Novel, even unprecedented, experimental methods have been and are being developed with which to image or record from large numbers of distributed neurons but understanding the integration step can be difficult since inputs and outputs are generally distributed over many millimeters, and it is very difficult to record from both simultaneously, especially so in a behaving animal.   This project will combine experimental and computational methods to elucidate such synaptic integration in pyramidal neurons associated with mammalian spatial navigation in awake, behaving animals.   The imaging data acquired from awake behaving mice will be made available to other groups and the full results will serve as a model for other research concerned with the integration of inputs in networks of neurons. The computational models will be made available on the ModelDB database and will be a resource to others working to understand other aspects of functionality in this brain region. Furthermore, the work will involve a close collaboration between experimental and computational research groups, thus giving postdoctoral fellows and graduate students cross-disciplinary research training.<br/><br/>In pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, the large dendritic tree constitutes an elaborate network of branching processes involving tens of thousands of excitatory synapses containing a variety of voltage-gated ion channels. The pattern of synaptic inputs impinging upon the dendritic arbor and the degree to which these inputs are processed by it to drive place field firing (i.e., firing correlated with spatial location) during behavior are currently unknown. The goals of the project are first to 1) develop improved computational models of dendritic place cell firing constrained by current imaging data and 2) establish new experimental techniques to image the inputs to pyramidal cells in the dendritic tree, at single spine resolution, during place field firing. Together the experiments and models will be used to 3) determine the degree to which local dendritic processing is involved in place cell firing.  The proposed experiments will allow for the construction of significantly improved models of hippocampal function and the models will provide a framework within which to understand activity recorded at a local level in the dendritic tree and assemble a comprehensive picture of dendritic processing across the whole arbor."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Arizona and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Michael Barker and Ryan Gutenkunst.<br/><br/>The process of domestication impacts levels of genetic diversity through the selection of individuals with desirable characteristics. Discovering what genes are associated with these agriculturally important traits can therefore be difficult as a result of this initial population bottleneck. Many agricultural species also have additional sets of chromosomes as a result of whole genome duplication (polyploidy), further complicating genetic analyses. This project focuses on the development of computational tools to identify domestication-related genes for crop improvement in polyploid species. These methods will be applied to canola (Brassica napus), an economically important polyploid crop responsible for the production of vegetable and synthetic oils, livestock feed, and biofuels. Training objectives include the development of statistical and computational methods and their application to the improvement of plant breeding efforts in polyploid crops. Broader impacts include the development of open-source software, tutorials, and teaching materials that can be used by plant breeders and educators.<br/><br/>Tools for the analysis of genome-wide DNA sequence data that aim to understand the process of domestication in polyploid crops are generally lacking. The main goals of this research are (1) to develop statistical models for the analysis of historical demography in polyploid crops, (2) to use these methods to infer the demographic history of B. napus, and (3) to leverage this demographic information to better identify domestication-related genes. This will be achieved through the implementation of new models in the Python package DaDi (Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference), applying these models to B. napus, and using the results to perform genome-scale simulations for the identification of genes under positive selection. All data, scripts, and protocols for this project will be made available in public repositories, and all software will be freely available and open source.<br/> <br/>Keywords: Brassica, canola, demography, domestication, polyploidy, selection<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, a great challenge is identifying the differences in DNA between related varieties of the same crop, which are responsible for the subtle trait variation that plant breeders exploit to improve productivity. A major contributor to this trait variation is 'genome structural variation' where pieces of DNA are deleted, inserted, or rearranged resulting in changes in gene expression. This project will focus on how structural variation contributed to domestication and breeding of tomatoes. A related goal is to expand and develop new molecular tools to create structural variation for crop improvement. This project will improve US agriculture by providing new knowledge and tools to efficiently and predictably enhance crop productivity. A major part of the project will also include training of young scientists in fundamental principles of plant genome research that can be applied to agriculture.  This knowledge will also be shared through outreach programs in inner city New York schools that do not have access to research opportunities. Project personnel will develop hands-on teaching activities that will highlight the importance of plant genomics and new genome editing technologies to improve crops and meet the agricultural needs of the 21st century.<br/><br/><br/>Limited knowledge on the extent and diversity of structural variation in plant genomes is hindering the ability to link genes to important crop phenotypes. This project will unite new long-read sequencing technologies, computational biology, developmental and quantitative genetics, and genome editing to elucidate and manipulate structural variation (SV) at a scale never before achieved for a major crop. Tomato provides a powerful system due to its relatively small and high quality reference genome and availability of resequenced genomes. By applying SV-detection algorithms to existing short-read Illumina sequencing data from hundreds of accessions, more than 40 genomes will be selected, capturing the majority of predicted SV diversity, to establish new reference genomes using the latest long-read sequencing technology (PacBio and 10X Genomics). From these data, a compendium of validated SVs will be generated and integrated with ongoing genome-wide association studies. Significant gene-associated SVs, including those affecting gene activity measured by genome-wide transcript profiling, will be characterized using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and quantitative phenotypic analyses, focusing on reproductive traits that drive crop productivity. In parallel, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be used to generate a collection of SV mutations in known yield and fruit quality genes in two related wild Solanaceae with agricultural potential, with the goal of achieving major steps towards domestication and for comparative developmental genetics studies. This project will greatly expand our knowledge of genomic diversity in tomato, and provide a road map for dissecting SVs in other crops, where such knowledge can be exploited to improve productivity."

Salinity is among the major environmental stresses that crop plants face, and it is currently threatening rice cultivation due to increasing land pressure and climate change, which are pushing agriculture to marginal lands. Rice is a major world crop comprising two species: one from Asia (Oryza sativa), and one from Africa (O. glaberrima). This project aims to identify genes associated with adaptation to saline soils through comparative analyses of rice varieties that have contrasting adaptation to salt stress, within and between the two species. The discovery of more than one adaptive strategy will increase the options rice breeders could implement in their programs. This project will use several approaches to identify genes that have a uniquely coordinated pattern of expression when the plant is exposed to elevated salt, and at the same time are correlated with vigorous growth and productivity. This project will also undertake public outreach programs using the New York City BioBus. This is a transit bus equipped as a mobile educational laboratory that has been on the road reaching 115,000 people at more than 420 schools and communities. Plant biology laboratory modules will be developed for deployment across New York City on the BioBus. These modules will primarily target schoolchildren in underserved communities, and also the general public in street fairs.<br/><br/>Salinity is one of the growing stress challenges crop plants face. In this systems genomics proposal, we will dissect the adaptive response of O. sativa (Asian rice) and O. glaberrima (African rice) to salt stress. First, we will infer the gene regulatory interaction network for salt stress in Asian and African rice using time-series transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data, coupled with state-of-the-art network inference methods. Second, we will use phenotypic selection analysis on gene expression levels to determine the strength and pattern of selection on stress response genes. Finally, we will map expression genome-wide association (GWAS) loci accompanying gene expression variation under salt stress, focusing on the genes that have been identified in phenotypic selection analysis as undergoing positive, stabilizing or disruptive selection. Moreover, we will also identity GWAS loci for plant fitness and fitness-related traits under saline conditions in both rice species, and integrate the results of these mapping analyses and phenotypic selection analyses with evidence for selective sweeps in whole genome sequence data from Asian and African rice. Our work will identify genes, genetic networks and genomic variants that affect gene expression differences in key loci in response to an environmental perturbation - salt stress -and explicitly connect gene regulatory variation to plant fitness."

A thorough understanding of how pathogens cause disease and how plants defend themselves is crucial for addressing food security challenges. How pathogens manipulate their host to enable infection and how plants counteract the pathogen are major outstanding questions in the field. Pathogen infection triggers complex molecular changes within host cells that result in either resistance or susceptibility. One emerging widespread biochemical modification to proteins is acetylation, which can change activity of the protein and can be measured globally using mass spectrometry. This project aims to determine the extent of and the role of pathogen triggered changes in protein acetylation state in the model plants corn and Arabidopsis. The results of these studies may provide a novel approach to engineering plant disease resistance via mimicking or blocking the ability of particular proteins to be modified (acetylated). The project will provide cutting edge training in functional genomics to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, including underrepresented minorities through the George Washington Carver Internship Program at Iowa State University.  <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular regulatory events mediated by protein lysine acetylation that govern the interplay between plants and microbes, using maize and Arabidopsis interactions with Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Botrytis cinerea as prototypes. Comprehensive -omics profiling will be coupled with directed biochemical and genetic experiments to define the molecular roles of lysine acetylation underpinning plant biotic stress responses. Sequencing of DNA enriched by chromatin-immunoprecipitation will define promoters that exhibit histone hyperacetylation and/or recruitment of transcriptional regulatory proteins following pathogen infection or effector treatment (HC-toxin). These data will be coupled with genome-wide profiling of mRNA and protein abundance, in several genetic backgrounds, following pathogen challenge to identify genes directly regulated by ZmMYC2 and REL2. Functional characterization of ZmMYC2 and REL2 will establish how acetylation of these proteins modulates their transcriptional regulatory activity. Analyses of acetylome profiling data generated from pathogen-infected maize and Arabidopsis plants will define how widespread dynamic lysine acetylation is during plant-pathogen interactions. Altogether this research will assess the impact of non-histone protein acetylation during plant-pathogen interactions and will compare and contrast the contributions of histone and non-histone acetylation in shaping the immune response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even so, which communities of bacteria will provide positive outcomes for their hosts cannot be reliably predicted. In large part, this is because there are seemingly infinite configurations of ""healthy"" microbiomes, making analysis of natural patterns difficult. Moreover, understanding of microbiome function is currently hampered by the complexity of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions underlying these positive outcomes.  Despite this complexity, however, recent research suggests that general principles underlying microbiome-mediated protection against pathogen establishment and disease may be identifiable. The combination of new sequencing technologies and the development of new experimental systems presents a unique opportunity to begin disentangling the interactions between the microbiome and disease, and to examine the generality of microbiome-mediated protection across different host species. A starting point for such an undertaking focuses on a broad host range pathogen, for which evidence of microbiome-mediated protection currently exists across multiple hosts. Using two different plant-microbiome-pathogen systems (one with direct relevance to forestry management and the other to agriculture) as proof of concept, the current work aims to build a predictive framework for identifying microbial consortia that synergize with the host immune system to protect against disease. <br/><br/>Building upon existing data from Bleeding Canker disease of Horse Chestnut trees and Bacterial Speck of Tomato plants, both of which are caused by pathovars of the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, this project will test the idea that there are general rules underlying microbiome-mediated protection that are applicable across systems. In each of these two systems, previous evidence has linked the diversity and composition of the phyllosphere (above ground) microbiome to pathogen colonization success and/or plant disease outcome. This project will use culture-independent sequencing data from the natural tree system to generate predictions about microbiome-mediated disease protection based on microbiome composition, diversity, and/or function. These predictions will then be tested using synthetic microbiomes in tomato plants, where the relative contributions of direct (microbe-microbe) and indirect (plant-mediated) effects in shaping microbiome-mediated protection can be experimentally quantified. By combining high-throughput seedling priming assays with a synthetic microbiome approach, the project seeks to identify disease protective community properties that synergize with plant defenses. The general principles of microbiome-mediated protection that this project seeks to uncover have the potential to be broadly applicable across systems, and inform predictions about protective microbial communities in human health and agriculture. The ultimate goal of the work is to be able to leverage these host-microbiome-pathogen interactions to attain robust and durable disease protection, and the results will aid in management of both agricultural and natural systems, and the development of probiotic treatment against plant disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those same conditions in adults can also be traced back to events early in life. Therefore understanding how organisms respond to environmental stress is crucial. However, this has been challenging partly because although responses to stress have been studied at but the cellular and whole organism level, scientists have not yet made a successful link between stress to the whole animal and the cellular consequences. The goals of the project are to 1) improve our understanding of stress responses at both levels and 2) critically evaluate how the stress response is regulated. This project also aims to improve science literacy and inquiry-based science education in rural regions of Alabama. First, this project will contribute to a more holistic view of how organisms respond to stress, and will teach middle and high-school students how events at molecular and whole-animal levels are interconnected. Second, models describing stress response regulation have been applied to evaluate diseases risk factors, e.g., obesity and socioeconomic status. This project will educate Alabamian public school students about the consequences of obesity, lifestyle, and diet and how to overcome stress. Finally, the participation in, and quality of, science fair projects in southeastern Alabama has been extremely low, although such projects provide a great opportunity to implement an inquiry-based approach to science education. In collaboration with biology teachers, the project will provide training, mentorship, and opportunities to conduct science fair projects to spark interests in biology, inspire scientific careers, and increase science literacy in regions historically underserved in STEM education.<br/><br/>Conceptualizing and studying stress has been challenging because stress responses extend across multiple biological scales, and the consequences of stress are often non-linear. This lack of integration is a major obstacle in this field, and is well exemplified by glucocorticoid- and heat shock protein-focused studies of stress responses. Therefore, this project will characterize an integrative stress response involving both HSPs and glucocorticoids. Specifically, this project will test the hypothesis that HSPs and glucocorticoids prime each other's response in preparation for subsequent stressors by determining whether 1) glucocorticoids elevate HSP and associated transcription factor and 2) a disruption in proteostasis, as regulated by the heat shock response pathway, elicits glucocorticoid responses. Elevation of HSPs and glucocorticoids has both protective and damaging effects. The allostasis model conceptualizes this non-linear nature of stress, yet this model has not been explicitly tested. Using zebra finches which adjust their heat tolerance with prior heat-conditioning, the project will also evaluate the allostasis model by testing the hypothesis that pre-conditioned birds elicit greater HSP and glucocorticoid responses than birds with no prior exposure to the stressor, thereby protecting individuals from stress-related suppression of reproductive and immune functions. By defining the direct and reciprocal relationship between HSP and glucocorticoid responses, this project will characterize organismal orchestration of the HSP response and provide a molecular basis for the switch from protective to damaging effects of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, this project will provide an in-depth evaluation of the allostasis model and whether this model applies to a stressor beyond nutritional stress."

Communication between males and females is often required for reproduction, and mating communication differs between species, preventing mating between different species. When male mating characteristics change dramatically, types with and without a new signal can become reproductively isolated, particularly when the preferences of signal receivers (often females) change in step with the male signals. The researcher discovered a novel song type, 'purring', in long-studied populations of Pacific field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Male crickets produce songs using specialized wing structures to attract females and urge them to mate. The researcher capitalizes on this opportunity to understand the earliest stages of mating signal evolution by measuring and tracking the components of the new purring song. The new song is detectable to female crickets of the same species and to a parasitoid fly. Female parasitoid flies use song to locate host crickets and then deposit larvae on them that will burrow into and later eat their way out of the crickets' body. The researcher will thus also measure preferences of female crickets and flies and investigate both the evolutionary history and genomic basis of the new song. The researcher links the contemporary evolution of animal communication with science communication through a program (STEMComm) founded on increasing diversity and inclusion in science and on increasing the cross-cultural literacy of participants. STEMComm will improve undergraduate and graduate students' training in science communication while engaging underserved urban and native Hawaiian students with leading-edge research. <br/><br/>The origins of evolutionary novelty remain elusive because of the inherent difficulty of catching novel trait evolution in action. The researcher discovered a new song ('purring') in Hawaiian populations of the Pacific field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, that is increasing in frequency in multiple populations. The novel song differs from the typical one in characteristics used to identify conspecifics and preferred mates, and is detectable to females and an eavesdropping natural enemy. This discovery affords an opportunity to document the origin of a novel male trait and its consequences for signal-preference relationships and sexual isolation in real time. Ancestral signals and preferences are well-characterized, and the system is known for rapid evolution of communication, particularly in response to an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly. The researcher will track replicate populations that contain purring males for 20 generations, revealing how novel traits come to coevolve (or not) with the preferences and perceptual capabilities of intended and unintended receivers, and will probe the evolutionary history and genomic architecture of purring crickets. Combining field studies with modern genomic techniques will provide an integrative understanding of the why and how of evolutionary novelty. The project seamlessly integrates research and education through a new science communication program modeled after Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education, adapting the research for a non-specialist audience and enhancing diversity and inclusion in science. Participants will partner with K-12 teachers to co-develop publishable curricula and pilot activities in classrooms, a summer camp for minoritized girls, and a community outreach program in Hawaii.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Network has two major goals: (1) to catalyze interdisciplinary training and research by encouraging and facilitating information exchange among its six founding member societies, a number intended to grow; and (2) to use dedicated workshops to seek novel solutions to broaden participation in plant sciences, and to re-examine how postdoctoral fellows should be trained in the plant sciences. Improved cross-talk between different stripes of experimental plant scientists, and with those contributing enabling technologies from imaging to robotics to informatics, promises to enrich and enliven the plant community, while leading to exciting and empowering fundamental discoveries about the wonders of plants. <br/><br/>By serving as a forum through which plant science constituencies coordinate their efforts to advance plant science research, education, and innovation, the Coordinated Plant Science Research and Education Network will coordinate and facilitate a successful effort by the broader plant community to establish a consensus-driven set of priorities which culminated in the 2013 publication of ""Unleashing a Decade of Innovation in Plant Science: A vision for 2015-2025"". The founding members of the Network are the American Society of Plant Biologists, the Alliance of Crop, Soil and Environmental Science Societies, the American Phytopathological Society, the American Society for Horticultural Science, the Botanical Society of America, the Genetics Society of America, and the Council on Undergraduate Research. The Network will be open to any interested scientific professional associations and will proactively engage other organizations with an interest in the study of plants. One of the main goals of the Network is to serve as a clearinghouse for the research, education and outreach activities and opportunities for its members and the wider plant science community. Expected outcomes include new collaborations among societies and scientists, including new interdisciplinary collaborative research projects that will advance the frontiers of plant sciences, and innovative recruitment and training strategies for the next generation of scientists required for excellence in U.S. plant science research. The Network will also convene two workshops, on broadening participation and postdoctoral training that aim to catalyze career building and diversification within the plant science workforce. To communicate the wonder and importance of plant research, the Network will develop a shared set of consistent messages to the public, including authoritative, science-based information on key societally relevant topics. Internal and external communication for the Network will be through Plantae.org, a modular web interface custom designed to serve the needs of the Network and members of the broader plant science community."

All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein.  There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid.  In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar.  However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently.  This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress.  This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production.  Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses.  This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses.  Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.<br/><br/>Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient.  Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression.  High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias.  It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes.  GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined.  Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner.  Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency.  Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders.  A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses.  The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If harnessed, non-fusion production of seeds will change the way hybrid seeds, such as corn, are currently made in agriculture. In order to understand the mechanisms of non-fusion reproduction, we propose to first understand how non-fusion embryos are formed in a simpler group of plants - ferns. Ferns are non-seed plants that lack the storage part of a seed but nonetheless form an embryo as the result of a sperm fertilizing an egg (fusion). The salient feature of a fern is having the sperm and egg producing parts of the plant housed in a tiny, free-living entity independent of the mother plants. Therefore this tiny, simple, green entity provides a rare opportunity to study the mechanisms of fusion reproduction, and important to this project, the non-fusion formation of an embryo without fertilization. Using this system, the genes key to non-fusion reproduction will be identified and their functions in this process tested. This research program will emphasize the identification and training of talented female scientists and data from the proposed research will be used in an undergraduate course.<br/><br/>Normally performing the essential roles of gamete formation and fertilization, the macroscopic gametophytes can also be coaxed to produce sporophytes without fertilization, a process called apogamy. In the reverse process, apospory, sporophytes can be made to produce gametophytes without meiosis. With apogamy and apospory, ferns can exhibit non-fusion alternation of the sporophyte and the gametophyte generations. This level of plasticity alternating between the two generations is not seen in seed plants. Thus, the apogamy and apospory of ferns offer an ideal system to answer the question that lies at the heart of non-fusion reproduction: Which genes control the developmental pathways leading to the gametophyte or the sporophyte generations? It is hypothesized that many genes that control fusion reproduction in ferns and seed plants are conserved and non-fusion reproduction in land plants has arisen by altering these genes. Furthermore, the non-fusion alternation of generations through apogamy and apospory in the model fern C. richardii occurs by altered regulation of a set of genes that normally are reserved for initiating embryogenesis from a zygote and gametogenesis from a spore, respectively. The research team has built up necessary technology and materials including apogamy induction, stable gene transfer, C. richardii transcriptome, and whole mount in situ methods. These will be used to achieve the goal of identifying key genes and gene networks involved in apogamy and apospory in the model fern C. richardii with the following specific aims: Studying the role of the candidate genes in fusion/non-fusion alternation of generations in C. richardii, gene discovery for apogamy and apospory in C. richardii, and functional analysis of newly discovered genes that are predicted to act in non-fusion alternation of generations in C. richardii."

A novel technique is used to delimit the beginning and ends of genome sequences that cellular machines read and transcribe into transient instructions.

In some manner, these ""dark matter"" instructions impact traits of economic interest by helping guide the coordinate reading of the genetic blueprint necessary for proper growth and optimal health. Although these ""dark matter"" regions represent the single largest source of genetic variation in worldwide plant varieties, their functions remains poorly understood. This project aims to decipher some of these functions by evaluating the effects of interfering with the transcription machinery dedicated to these ""dark matter"" regions in diverse maize varieties. The publicly available information, analytical tools, and materials generated by this project will significantly elevate the utility of existing resources and provide an essential reference for novel discoveries in plant biology and genetics. The activities will integrate the training of young scientists at both undergraduate and graduate levels and, in collaboration with the American Chemical Society, provide research experiences for high school students of economic disadvantage. Additionally, educational materials for teaching both basic and advanced genetic concepts will be generated and made available through an existing outreach program of the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.<br/><br/>Gene expression is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels; yet the contribution of each to RNA abundance is often unknown.

This project defines the nascent transcriptional landscape of maize, identifies potential cases of co- or post-transcriptional control, and uses mutant analyses to understand how these Pol II-related RNAP complexes affect gene expression. Specifically, this project will 1) optimize protocols for global run-on sequencing and generate reference nascent transcriptome datasets to enable novel genome annotations; 2) use specific mutants and comparative RNA profiling to differentiate gene regulation due to RNA-directed DNA methylation versus RNAP IV competitions and to allow individual RNA stabilities to be inferred; 3) identify features where regulation is heritably altered in the absence of RNAP IV to catalog epialleles whose transcriptional behaviors resemble those susceptible to paramutation; and 4) use mutant analyses to evaluate the hypothesis that RNAP IV translates environmental perception into changes in heritable transcriptional control. Project outcomes will provide important community resources to understand the nuclear systems that generate and maintain epigenome diversity in a crop species. All data generated from this project will be made immediately available, integrated into existing database frameworks, and promoted through training and outreach opportunities to empower a greater understanding of eukaryotic genetics and the genome biology of crop species."

PG is unique to these microorganisms. It is essential for bacterial survival, and has a remarkably conserved structure throughout diverse bacterial groups.  PG is not found in plants and animals, and given its essentialness and conservation in bacteria, it is an excellent target for antibiotics and innate immunity.  Thus, PG is a focus of strategies for bacterial detection and control.  Blocking the ability of bacteria to make a normal PG structure is generally lethal, yet in rare instances bacteria with novel PG have evolved naturally.  This project uses the model animal-associated bacterium Vibrio fischeri to explore what happens when PG is experimentally forced to evolve.  The results will shed light on the natural evolution of peptidoglycan, on the constraints of its function in bacteria, and on the limits of targeting PG as a means of controlling bacteria.  Moreover, V. fischeri is a natural symbiotic bacterium that colonizes a Hawaiian squid, and PG is a key signaling molecule in this symbiosis. Thus, it offers the opportunity to examine how peptidoglycan structure affects the ability of host animal tissue to detect and respond to its resident bacteria (i.e., its microbiome).  The broader impacts of this work for society include interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate student training, outreach to community K-12 schools, and contributions to a book on bacterial symbionts geared for use in the classroom. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate how unusual changes to bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan (PG) structure can evolve, and it will help define constraints on PG evolution.  This project will examine how the tractable bacterium Vibrio fischeri can evolve new PG structure(s) using a strategy of iteratively blocking both normal and alternative pathways to PG biosynthesis. Viable mutants generating novel PG will be selected. Such mutants are likely to have distinctly non-wild-type properties of growth, cell shape, motility, etc.; however, rounds of growth in culture will lead to evolved strains that have accommodated the new PG.  A combination of phenotypic testing and whole-genome resequencing will underpin a systems-type analysis of these evolved strains.  The integrated analysis of genetic and phenotypic data will improve our understanding of how the cell wall is coordinated with other cellular components and processes, and it will lead to the discovery of new phenotypically important interconnections in bacterial cells.  The results will inform our understanding of the natural evolution of PG and lead to a more predictive understanding of how PG might evolve in the future, e.g. under selective pressure from antibiotic use.   V. fischeri is a symbiont in a model squid symbiosis, in which symbiont PG triggers developmental changes in the host.  This study will provide insight into the relationship between PG structure and its function in this symbiosis, with broader implications for understanding innate immunity in higher organisms."

This technology has been used to identify areas of the genome that differ between populations occurring in different environments, and which may be important in preventing closely-related species from forming hybrids. This project uses similar methods to compare populations that differ in whether they co-exist with a close relative with which they can hybridize. The project focuses on orangethroat darter fish.  The project will identify genome areas associated with a preference to mate with one's own species, and test whether the same genetic changes happen in all closely-related species that coexist, or whether unique genetic changes occur each time. Data obtained from this study will provide critical insight into how differences in biological communities can drive species diversity. This project will provide valuable research opportunities and teaching materials for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used to educate community members about the biology of local native fish species. <br/><br/>Reinforcement plays a critical role in finalizing the process of speciation after secondary contact by increasing prezygotic isolation between taxa that produce unfit hybrids. As reinforcement directly selects for divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations, it can also incidentally lead to behavioral isolation among populations within species (i.e., cascade reinforcement). The objective of this project is to develop genomic tools to examine how reinforcement affects genome-wide divergence between and within species in two groups of darters (the orangethroat darter clade Ceasia and the rainbow darter Etheostoma caeruleum). Previous studies have provided strong behavioral evidence that reinforcement is driving behavioral isolation between sympatric Ceasia and E. caeruleum, and subsequently causing cascade reinforcement and behavioral isolation between species within Ceasia. This research will examine genomic divergence between species experiencing reinforcement, and investigate whether this divergence between species may incidentally be causing genomic divergence among populations within species (or among recently diverged species). Specifically, Next-Generation Sequencing will be utilized to (1) identify any differences in chromosomal structure between Ceasia and E. caeruleum that may be contributing to postzygotic isolation and facilitating reinforcement, (2) identify loci responsible for postzygotic isolation between Ceasia and E. caeruleum by genotyping hybrid and backcross individuals, and (3) conduct genome scans that compare genetic differentiation between multiple populations of Ceasia that are sympatric and allopatric with respect to E. caeruleum, in order to identify highly differentiated outlier loci between sympatric and allopatric populations that are likely associated with prezygotic isolation."

One theory of selection provides a robust explanation for variation in male coloration, or ornamentation, through the process of females choosing increasingly elaborate males over numerous generations. In contrast, the evolution of female ornamental coloration has received comparatively little attention, and is not intuitively explained using current theory. The White-shouldered Fairywren (Malurus alboscapulatus) of New Guinea is an unusual species of bird in which female coloration varies across populations, while male plumage remains constant. Experimental evidence suggests that more ornamented coloration in females is associated with heightened aggression and increased levels of testosterone. However, the connection between behavior and the underlying process that has led to the appearance of female ornamentation in this species remain unclear. This research aims to determine what genes are responsible in male and female fairywrens for producing ornamentation. The research addresses a core goal in evolutionary biology in identifying the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for generating specific appearances, but from a uniquely female-perspective approach. Understanding the processes involved in generating patterns of biodiversity will be communicated to local communities at our study sites in New Guinea and to local school aged children in New Orleans.    <br/><br/>A contemporary goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the genomic changes that control phenotypic variation and how genomic variation generates diversity in traits. The investigators will use high throughput sequencing techniques to explore the underlying genetic control of plumage variation in the White-shouldered Fairywren. They have two complementary goals: to use whole genome resequencing to identify regions of the genome that may be under selection and to use RNA sequencing to test for differences in gene expression between distinct female phenotypes. The study will advance the understanding of the evolution of sex-specific coloration by testing hypotheses for how changes in female ornaments may arise on a mechanistic level, which can then be contextualized with data the researchers have gathered on current adaptive function of the trait. The strength of this system is that it presents an opportunity to compare variation in female ornaments, rather than the more commonly observed and better studied variation in male traits. Female ornaments are influenced not only by selective forces acting on the traits, but also by the genetic mechanisms that produce the phenotype. The proposed genetic work will build on prior research in this species to provide a broad understanding of the evolution and function of female ornamentation that integrates field observation, experimental manipulation, and laboratory techniques. In doing so, the research is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the proximate basis for and ultimate consequences of elaborate female coloration."

How this signal diversity came about and why animals use more than one trait to communicate has long interested scientists. To understand why and how this diversity in multiple signaling traits evolved, we are studying hummingbird iridescent plumage and exaggerated courtship displays. Iridescent coloration is angle-dependent and hummingbirds can easily manipulate the color observed as they behaviorally display. The PIs are exploring how the surface and internal structures of iridescent feathers co-evolved with courtship displays (shuttles) across hummingbird species. The PIs work combines measurements of micro- and nano-scale structural morphology with behavioral ecology and evolutionary theory, allowing the PIs to understand hummingbird communication from the behavior down to feather architecture. Additionally, the PIs will collect data on hummingbird mating and courtship biology, especially in terms of how hummingbirds use their environment while courting, which could prove useful to future conservation efforts. Additionally, recent work on the structure of iridescent butterfly wing scales has helped the development of more efficient solar panels. The PIs work on the angle-dependent nanostructures of hummingbird feathers could further help improve solar panel efficiency through a better understanding of how biological materials directionally reflect specific wavelengths of light.<br/><br/>Technical paragraph<br/>Animals exhibit a great diversity of ornamental traits and display behaviors, and many animals possess multiple such traits that they use to communicate. Previous work has explained the diversity in these traits by examining how they evolved in relation to the environment; however these traits can also interact with each other as they are displayed, which will further shape their evolutionary history. The PIs are testing how interactions between ornamental traits, display behaviors, and environment influence the diversity of these traits through a comparative study on several species in the bee hummingbird tribe. Bee hummingbirds are ideal for this type of study because they possess two types of conspicuous visual traits - iridescent plumage coloration and stereotyped courtship displays (shuttles) - that vary across species. Iridescent coloration is angle-dependent, such that the observed color changes depending upon the feather structure and viewing/lighting angles. Thus, perceived coloration is the result of interactions between behavioral displays, the environment, and the micro- and nanostructures of iridescent feathers. The PIs are currently studying the complex interactions between these factors in several hummingbird species to understand how each species produces a specific color that is perceived by a receiver, and how this varies interspecifically. The PIs are expanding this work by evaluating how variation in iridescent micro- and nanostructure of feathers helped shaped the evolutionary relationships between bee hummingbird plumage, display, and environment. This work allows the PIs to study how hummingbird communication evolved at multiple levels, from behaviors to nanostructure of their ornaments."

For example, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake in response to famine.  Animals with these adaptations are likely to have an evolutionary advantage, especially in environments where food is scarce. In rodents, neural circuits in the brain that control feeding behavior develop during the last half of gestation, making maternal nutrition crucial during late pregnancy. In fact, maternal energy availability during pregnancy directly influences the development of offspring neural and hormonal machinery. However, we know very little about the mechanisms responsible for these developmental changes, especially in food hoarding animals.  This work will contribute to the broad understanding about the effects of maternal nutrition on neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate feeding, providing insight into feeding strategies adopted by offspring in response to variations in predicted postnatal environment. The educational activities integrate research and teaching efforts, develop a new major program in Neuroscience and provide a resource website for information about the PI's research and teaching.<br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental questions essential for understanding how gestational nutrient availability affects offspring ingestive behavior. Ingestive behavior consists of two phases: 1) the appetitive phase, consisting of foraging and food hoarding, and 2) the consummatory phase consisting of actual food ingestion. The consummatory phase (food intake) is well studied in rats and mice. The appetitive phase, however, has received comparatively little attention, even though those behaviors are common to most animals including humans. Unlike rats and mice, hamsters use appetitive behaviors extensively in their ingestive behavioral repertoire, and they use information about internal and external sources (i.e. both body fat and food hoards) of metabolic fuels to maintain energy balance. In addition, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake during energetic challenges to maintain homeostasis. Preliminary data from this model indicate that male hamsters exposed to gestational nutrient restriction have increased food intake and reduced food hoarding, along with increases in plasma insulin, abdominal fat and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y, while females appear to be largely unaffected. These unique sexually differentiated findings, along with the lack of previous attention to gestational programming of appetitive ingestive behaviors increase the likelihood that the proposed experiments will make significant contributions to the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology. The broader impacts of this project include enhanced undergraduate student mentoring in research, development of a new laboratory course that integrates peer review and publication components, resources for a new Neuroscience major with an integrated K-12 outreach and development of a website describing the curricular innovations and neuroscience research at both general and detailed levels"

In many animal groups, such as schooling fish and flocking birds, the degree and speed of inter-individual communication allows individual group members to make fast and accurate collective decisions across a range of contexts, and often under conditions of considerable risk. Such emergent properties are highly desirable for many technological applications, including coordinated search, control and response by groups of robotic agents. This project will employ an experimental approach to map the relationship between sensory input and behavioral output in schooling fish under a range of ecologically-relevant scenarios in order to identify the dynamic networks of sensory communication in groups and relate this to the elementary movement behaviors exhibited by individuals, and the highly effective collective behavior exhibited by groups. These results will directly inform collective robotics.

The predominant paradigm has been to consider individuals in such groups as ""self-propelled particles"", which interact with neighbors through ""social forces"".   A major limitation of this approach is that it neither considers the sensory information available to animals when making movement decisions within groups nor considers that organisms make decisions in a state - dependent and probabilistic fashion. To map the relationship between visual and lateral line sensory input and resulting behavior in schooling fish under ecologically-relevant conditions that vary in timescale and type of response, the PI will use custom software to determine the location, body posture and eye positions of members of the group to reconstruct the visual fields of all individuals in groups of up to several hundred fish. Bayesian, unsupervised learning and inverse methodologies will be used to identify the visual information used by individuals and to map the structure of social response facilitated by the lateral line. Multi-scale network analysis will be used to identify important properties and meaningful motifs/substructures within groups, and to relate these to collective capabilities. Information transfer across sensory networks will be quantified using information theoretic techniques under the different ecological contexts. These data will inform subsequent manipulations of individual behavior to test predictions about how groups filter noise and respond to extraneous cues. From this work the researchers will create new models of collective animal behavior."

However, conventional genetic analyses do not adequately consider how social interactions affect the genetic basis of traits. Furthermore, all well-developed model systems are solitary and no highly social system amenable to genetic analysis has been developed. This project will develop novel genomic approaches and a new highly social ant system to study the genetic and behavioral basis, and evolution of social traits. Because social interactions are ubiquitous, and humans are highly social, with behavior, health, and lifespan strongly dependent on the social environment, the project is expected to have widespread implications. The research components of the project are tightly integrated with several educational components targeted at the high school, undergraduate, PhD, and postdoctoral levels to increase education and training in the areas of genetics, genomics, behavior, and evolution. <br/><br/>Social interactions mean that socially-influenced traits are properties of the genomes of multiple interacting individuals. The project develops a novel social systems-level approach, building on the interacting phenotypes framework, to elucidate the genetic and behavioral mechanisms underlying the expression and evolution of socially-influenced traits. The project combines: 1). genome-wide studies of transcriptional and evolutionary patterns associated with social trait expression; 2). gene mapping studies to identify the subset of loci underlying social trait expression that are polymorphic and contribute to social trait variation and evolution; and 3). gene-level studies to verify the phenotypic effects of identified candidate genes in the ant Monomorium pharaonis and in the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. The project develops M. pharaonis as a new ant model system for studying the genetic basis and evolution of social traits. The study trait, reproductive caste is a well-studied socially-influenced trait that is also the archetypal example of reproductive altruism. Because workers in the study species are obligately sterile, their genes with social effects on caste must evolve via kin selection. Thus, this research will provide genome-wide identification of sets of socially-acting genes shaped by kin selection and will identify evolutionary genetic signatures of kin selection. All data generated by the project will be made publicly available through online databases."

The high energy containing end product of photosynthesis is sugar that has to be translocated, via a tissue called phloem, from the site of generation (in most cases leaves) to the sites of consumption and storage (stems, roots, fruits). Humans either consume energy rich plant tissues directly in the form of salads, cereals, vegetables etc., or indirectly via the consumption of meat, which was produced by animals consuming plants. The translocation of sugars within the phloem is a key mechanism in the production of high quality, high yield, and healthy food. For example, photosynthesis is actively reduced by the plant if export of sugars through the phloem is insufficient. Pests like aphids attack the phloem, insert their mouthparts into the tissue and feed on the sugar rich solution, which results in loss of production. Plant viruses travel through the phloem and cause severe damage to the plant. Despite the central role the phloem plays in plant performance and food production, the knowledge of the underlying processes of phloem loading and transport are poorly understood. This project will investigate the flow path of sugars through leaves, the entry or ""loading"" of sugars into the phloem and the distribution of sugars within the plant. Enhanced understanding of phloem loading and transport could lead to new strategies to protect plants from pests, to increase crop yield and to produce healthier food by reducing or eliminating the necessity for application of pesticides.<br/><br/>The goal of this award is to investigate physiological parameters of phloem loading and the physics of transport in plants with long phloem networks (vines and trees). Methods developed during previous awards will be used to generate cell and tissue-type based maps of leaves outlining turgor pressure and phloem flow patterns in different vein orders. In addition, the distribution of plasmodesmata between cells and tissues, and cell-to-cell conductivity from source cells to sieve tubes will be mapped. New systems to measure sieve tube turgor and flow velocity, as well as straightforward SEM based methods will be used to gather data on plasmodesmal frequencies and sieve plate structure. The relationship between plant size and source turgor pressure and phloem architecture in trees and vines with different loading types will also be investigated. This will allow current models of phloem transport to be re-parameterized so as to reflect better the hydraulic architecture of the pathway for photoassimilate transport through the plant. This award will also bring together researchers specializing in plant cell biology and vascular transport, and support education and training for a postdoctoral researcher and graduate students, as well as engage undergraduates in research and provide opportunities for high-school students and teachers to learn about the transport of photoassimilates in plants."

Surprisingly, it is still not known how zebrafish determine which gender they will become. In humans, gender is determined by the specific chromosomes that are inherited from the parents, were XY individual are male and XX individuals are female. However, in zebrafish no such specific chromosomes have been identified. Recent studies from several labs, including the Draper lab, have found that oocytes, the precursor to eggs, are required for female development and for maintenance of the female fate. Zebrafish that cannot produce oocytes develop and males, and adult female fish that lose their oocytes revert to males. These studies have concluded that oocytes produce a signal that functions to promote and maintain female development. The Draper lab has identified two candidate oocyte-produced signaling molecules and they have strong preliminary data that indicates that one functions to initiate female development, while the other functions to maintain female development in adults. With this award they will further determine how these signals regulate the choice between male and female development. Completion of these studies will provide fundamental knowledge about how zebrafish gender is determined, which will be important for other scientist working with zebrafish, but will also provide insights into this process in other fish species. Finally, understanding how these signals influence gender in zebrafish may lead to the identification of previously unknown pathways by which environmental pollutants can affect gender ratios and function in wild fish populations. This is of major importance as fish are a vital food source for much of the world's population and wild fish stocks are under intense and increasing pressures that are due to over-fishing, pollution and habitat destruction. In addition to these benefits, this study will also provide mentorship and meaningful scientific research experience to underrepresented and/or disadvantaged graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The zebrafish is an ideal model organism for introducing students to cutting edge biological research.<br/><br/>The zebrafish is a major model organism that is used by hundreds of labs around the world.  Yet, the mechanism of zebrafish gender determination remains unknown. Several recent studies have determined that no single genetic locus is responsible for gender determination, and that the ability to produce oocytes is a prerequisite for female determination. While zebrafish do not switch gender as adults, the Draper lab has recently discovered that maintenance of the adult female phenotype is an active process that requires continuous signaling from oocytes to the somatic gonad. Together these studies suggest that an oocyte-derived signal(s) influences the fate of the somatic gonad, which in turn regulates the overt phenotype of the animal through production of hormones. Several key questions remain to be resolved: 1) what is the nature of the oocyte-derived signal? 2) What is the function of the oocyte-derived signal? 3) Is there a mechanistic link between female primary determination and maintenance of the adult female phenotype? The working hypothesis is that the oocyte signal promotes estrogen production by the somatic gonad, and that a threshold level of estrogen is required for female primary determination and maintenance of the adult phenotype. Absent this, the somatic gonad defaults to a male developmental program, resulting in male primary determination in larvae, or female-to-male reversal in adults. These predictions will be tested in three aims using a combination of gene knockout and transgenic technologies: Specific Aim 1 will test if estrogen production by the somatic gonad (specifically by granulosa cells) is necessary and sufficient to promote female primary determination and maintenance of the adult female phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether canonical Wnt signaling is necessary and sufficient for female primary determination. Specific Aim 3 will test the necessity of the oocyte-expressed cell-signaling molecule Bmp15 to promote granulosa cell development, estrogen production, and maintenance of female determination. It is anticipated that these studies will have significant impact on our understanding of the mechanism that allows 2% of teleost species to revert as adults. In addition, they should lead to methods that allow the regulation of gender ratios in zebrafish and perhaps other fish species. Finally, knowing the detailed mechanism of the germ cell-somatic gonad signaling circuitry in zebrafish may identify previously unknown pathways by which environmental pollutants can affect gender ratios and function in wild fish populations."

Network stability increases with age, producing both costs and benefits.  Different species have evolved distinct patterns of plasticity reduction.  This project compares developmental changes in visual system plasticity across several mammalian species.  It will reveal how early sensory experience influences the way brain circuits are put together, and how ongoing sensory stimulation maintains the boundary between stability vs. flexibility of neural circuits.  Because the genomes of many mammals have now been sequenced, it is possible to employ genetic manipulations that until recently were only feasible in mice.  Comparative work is necessary to arrive at a more complete understanding of plasticity mechanisms and to determine whether animals with better vision and more reliance on visual perception for survival than mice (the current species of choice) might provide a better animal model for human visual development.  Taken together, the results of the study will provide important mechanistic information about how and why the brain develops and changes with experience, and which animal models are the most relevant for biomedical research.  Understanding the natural processes that control the boundary between plasticity and stability make it possible to manipulate that boundary for human benefit.  Results from this study will also provide basic information about neural network plasticity which may be useful for designing drug and rehabilitative therapies to treat or repair diseases or injuries of visual pathways specifically, and brain pathways in general.<br/><br/>Visual experience during an early critical period is required for normal development of visual cortical (V1) structure and function in carnivores and non-human primates.  Mice are now the preferred animal model for studies of visual pathway development and plasticity.  Visual development and plasticity of mice differs from that of primates in both known and unknown ways that may have important consequences for the generalization of research findings to humans.  Previous visual deprivation studies in hamsters and mice from the P.I.'s lab have shown that early visual experience is not required for normal developmental refinement of receptive fields in visual midbrain and visual cortex.  Instead, vision is necessary only for the maintenance of normal function in visual midbrain (SC) and V1 of adults.  The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the degree to which a species' visual system development depends on visual experience is influenced by the extent to which vision is important in their ecological niche.  The predicted outcome is that nocturnal species whose young stay in a burrow (such as mice) will be less dependent on vision to shape the development of their visual pathways than diurnal species whose young spend more time above ground.  The timing and level of sensitivity to visual experience will be measured in several rodent species that differ in their daily activity patterns, nesting habits, and ecological niche.  The rodent data will be compared to that from a carnivore species that has traditionally been used in studies of visual system development and plasticity."

Specifically, the project is focused on understanding the interplay between ascending and descending (feedback) activity patterns in the olfactory system of behaving mice. Here, the investigator does not simply focus on the olfactory sensory module that integrates and transmits information from the nose to the brain but determines how higher brain areas, namely, the olfactory cortex, interact in the recurrent processing loop. This strategy enables the investigator to evaluate how sensory inputs are shaped by internal brain states via feedback. Furthermore, the investigator works at the interface of two approaches by combining cutting-edge experimental approaches--optical imaging and optogenetic strategies-- with novel computational models that give rise to non-mutually exclusive testable predictions. The investigator determines whether these feedforward-feedback loops contribute to attention states, extraction of odor identity, or broadcasting of predictions and error signals related to the incoming odorants. Experimental techniques are complemented, through an international collaboration, with state-of-the-art data analysis that characterizes neuronal population dynamics along high-dimensional trajectories and measures occurrence of activity patterns, characteristic timescales, patterns interaction, and coordination as a function of behavior. Additionally, the project provides opportunities for students and postdoctoral trainees from the USA and Romania to expand their experimental and computational skills through their participation in the international collaboration.<br/><br/>A central goal of systems neuroscience is to describe behaviors in terms of the neuronal circuits that control them. This constitutes a steep challenge in the mammalian brain, because behaviors are thought to rely on widely distributed feedforward, as well as top-down feedback neural representations, which are technically difficult to monitor at large scales and manipulate at cellular resolution. The project builds on recent experimental results from the lead investigator and novel algorithms for odor identification developed by the international collaborator. Specifically, the project probes the fine structure of olfactory perception and tests the central hypothesis that feedback serves one or more of the following three mechanisms: predictive coding, attractor generation, or attention to enhance the discriminability of behaviorally relevant stimuli. The dynamics of: a) cortical-bulbar feedback, and b) olfactory bulb output neurons on which feedback acts indirectly via interneurons are monitored and subsequently modulated with cellular resolution in mice engaged in olfactory discrimination forced-choice tasks and contextual reversal learning tasks. Reversible optogenetic local suppression of cortical feedback in the olfactory bulb is combined with simultaneous two-photon resonant scanning imaging (100 Hz) of hundreds of neurons. To address the proposed feedback roles, specific experimental design is combined with machine learning tools and dynamical systems analysis."

How and why the same genome leads to such enormous diversity of cell types and functions are unanswered questions of modern biology. Yet, cell-specific approaches to link cause and effect are virtually absent for a majority of animal groups. This interdisciplinary project addresses these bottlenecks experimentally by developing novel genomic approaches and chemical labeling tools for genome-wide characterization of expression, classification, and mapping of thousands of individual cells in parallel. This information is used to (i) achieve a nearly complete census of cell types within a given organism, focusing on animal models critical to understanding mechanisms of learning and memory, such as Aplysia, and regeneration, such as Pleurobrachia, and (ii) generate nanoscale probes that selectively mark specific cells for genome editing, regardless of any advance knowledge about the cells' molecular diversity. Several communities are benefiting from the proposed research, including comparative neurobiology, development, biological oceanography, and the emerging field of synthetic biology.  The project also affords cross-disciplinary training opportunities for trainees from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level and educational outreach activities in marine and comparative biology aimed at a diverse K-12 student body. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in our understanding of the genomes-to-phenomes relationships is our general inability to manipulate genome operation at the level of specific individual cells at any given location and at any given time. These obstacles are more dramatic for most invertebrates, when researchers study development or neuronal functions with little information about the cellular composition of target organs. Here, microfluidics for massive parallel single-cell capture and sequencing are integrated with novel cell selection technologies, such as aptamer-based-Cell-SELEX, for quantitative gene expression analyses and imaging of individual cells in intact tissues. Aplysia (and, once single-cell tools are validated, Pleurobrachia and/or related ctenophore species) are used to achieve nearly complete genome-wide classification of the majority of cell types in their neural systems and effector organs. The read-out(s) to measure/control gene expression in identified neurons are: scRNA-seq data with both normalized and absolute quantification of expression levels for target genes, and q-RT-PCR. Controls are neurons in which target genes are not active or silenced. First, unique resources for a diversity of cell adhesion molecules and other surface macromolecular structures critical to design and characterize cell-specific probes are generated. Then, using tools of chemical evolution, a high-throughput system to manufacture cell-specific aptamer-/molecular beacon-based fluorescent probes at a large scale is tested. Finally, hybrid nanoscale probes (e.g. made by coupling cell-specific fluorescent markers with nucleic acid analogues) are tested for their ability to self-deliver molecular constructs into target cells without direct injection, electroporation, or the need to make transgenic animals.

Yet, despite this work, little is known about signal evolution from a physiological perspective, particularly with respect to how the nervous system is changed to support the emergence of novel signals. To address this issue, this research project investigates the mechanisms underlying an unusual reproductive communication signal in frogs, known as the ""foot flag.""  By comparing how androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, act on the spinal cord and hind limb muscles in foot-flagging vs. non foot-flagging frogs, this project aims to understand what changes occurred as foot-flagging evolved in this species group.  This project also applies physiological models that have explained motor disease to understanding the evolution of this complex and ecologically relevant behavior.  Results provide insight into how neural systems can evolve and function in the natural environment.  Additionally, the unique collaboration between researchers at a women's college, a research university, and the world-class Vienna Zoo provide hands-on research experiences for 1st and 2nd year undergraduates, particularly women and first-generation college students.  The investigators also incorporate this research into undergraduate courses and fund international research experiences that include public outreach about the biology and conservation of foot-flagging frogs in Borneo, India, and Peru.<br/><br/>This project uses a comparative approach and combines molecular and behavioral analyses to test how the action of androgenic hormones is modified in neuromotor systems to support the evolution of new reproductive communication signals. Prior data shows that the emergence of ""foot flagging"" in male frogs - a signal that is produced by conspicuously waving the hind limb - is marked by a 10-fold increase in the androgenic sensitivity within the skeletal muscles that control this movement. Using quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization to compare androgen receptor levels in foot-flagging vs. non-foot flagging species, this research project tests the hypothesis that changes in expression levels and patterning of androgen receptors within multiple levels of the hindlimb neuromotor pathway are associated with the independent evolution of foot flagging in multiple frog lineages. Furthermore, this project uses pharmacological tools to block androgen receptors in order to test the hypothesis that androgenic signaling in leg muscles is required for foot-flagging behavior and to support the spinal motor circuitry that controls hind limb movement. Though such ""bottom up"" modification of neuromotor circuitry is reported in studies of motor disease, this project is the first study to explore this as a mechanism for regulating a complex and ecologically relevant motor behavior."

Harsh environments such as cold weather or inadequate food can cause animals to slow their growth or even pause growth altogether.  Despite this severe interruption to their development, if the environment improves, animals will continue their growth and ultimately become normal adults.  The genes and proteins that allow animals to develop normally after a long interruption are unknown and are a major knowledge gap.  This project builds on previous work from the PI to study this question in the microscopic nematode C. elegans.  These worms are a valuable model because of their simplicity and ease of use for experiments.  Furthermore, C. elegans shares 7,663 genes with humans, meaning that what we learn from C. elegans is often relevant across species.  As part of this study, a new program will engage student teachers in research.  This program will foster teacher-leaders who will then provide effective STEM education at the K-12 level.  This education is critical for the US to maintain its leadership in scientific disciplines, and to provide students with skills that employers value.  Furthermore, this study will result in the training of many undergraduate and graduate students, both in the PI's research lab and in lab-based courses taught by the PI.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The proposed work capitalizes on the power of C. elegans as a model to elucidate mechanisms that enable development to occur normally after diapause.  In favorable environments, C. elegans develops continuously through four larval stages separated by molts.  In contrast, adverse environments promote entry into diapause (""dauer"") midway through larval development.  Despite this interruption, if favorable conditions are again encountered, development proceeds normally due to the modulation of developmental pathways and re-setting of cell fate.  Prior work from the PI indicates that the potentiation of microRNA activity is a key component of the post-dauer developmental program.  This project builds on that work to discover and characterize factors involved in post-dauer microRNA pathways.  Preliminary data suggest that two transcription factors, ZTF-16 and FOXO/DAF-16, are important players in the post-dauer pathway. Genetic and molecular experiments will test the hypotheses that ZTF-16 is a microRNA target and that FOXO/DAF-16 is a modulator of microRNA activity.  In addition, genomic approaches will identify factors that enable proper post-dauer development.  Completing this project will define mechanisms by which microRNA pathways that control cell fate are modulated after dauer and lay the foundation for future work."

These animals face daily, seasonal, and annual fluctuations in temperature which will affect their ability to survive and find mates. Communication between males and females is especially challenging in this light. Successful communication requires coordination between them, yet male and female behavior may change independently with the surrounding temperature. Because communication is critical to the lives of most animals, understanding the effects of temperature on communication is necessary to understand animals in natural environments. Using a combination of laboratory and field studies, Dr. Elias' project will evaluate how temperature in natural environments changes, investigate how temperature affects different aspects of communication in ""cold blooded"" spiders, and experimentally test how predicted shifts in temperature will affect species interactions.  Dr. Elias' project joins two existing fields of study, thermal physiology and animal communication, to investigate a basic yet under studied phenomenon common to most animals. This project will also serve to predict potential impacts of changing environmental conditions on animal communication. Dr. Elias will use his research to raise awareness on the utility of basic research using a multimedia website, collaborations with artists, and various social media outlets.  In addition, Dr. Elias will design video games aimed at educating the public in aspects related to animal communication and behavioral theory. <br/><br/>There has recently been a shift in mate choice research towards approaches integrating environmental heterogeneity. One aspect of environmental heterogeneity that has been relatively ignored is thermal heterogeneity. This is particularly interesting in the context of mating as temperature is known to affect multiple aspects of these behaviors. The goal of Dr. Elias' project is to integrate studies of thermal ecology with mating behavior to understand patterns of selection in the field and predict impacts of environmental change.  To describe the ecological context, Dr. Elias will first quantify thermal environments, species distributions, and make observations on species across thermal habitats. Secondly, Dr. Elias will perform experiments to calculate thermal performance curves for species in different thermal environments. Using these data, Dr. Elias will test the hypothesis that thermal tolerances shape community structure and perform mate choice studies across a range of temperatures. This work will be the first to examine how communication dynamics may change as a result of environmental change. Understanding selection landscapes is a key goal in behavioral ecology, and Dr. Elias will be able to address the role of temperature and temperature variation in shaping selection. Finally, Dr. Elias will investigate the role of temperature on species hybridization which has the potential to weaken species boundaries and hasten extinction. This work will be one of the first to propose and test this potential consequence of environmental change and as such be important in plans to mitigate its effects."

Of interest to the principal investigator of this project is the ability of stress to impair sustained attention, the process of monitoring situations for rare and unpredictably occurring events. Adequately sustaining attention is critical for accurately performing more complex cognitive tasks.  Therefore, disruptions in sustained attention as a result of stress can lead to widespread cognitive impairments. Surprisingly, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the effect of stress on this type of attention are unknown. This project addresses this gap in knowledge by using behavioral, neuroanatomical, and molecular approaches to test how a specific stress-related chemical signal, corticotropin releasing factor, regulates the brain circuitry required for sustained attention in male and female rats. The results from this research will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between the brain systems involved in stress and attention. These findings thereby may lay the groundwork for the development of strategies aimed at improving cognition during stressful events. In addition to the scientific work, this project includes an education plan designed to improve student learning outcomes for Temple University's diverse undergraduate population and create public resources for improving the teaching of college courses in the ""flipped-classroom"" format, in which students first learn new material outside of class and then use class time to work on exercises with classmates and the instructor.<br/><br/>Studies have examined how stress modulates learning, the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress modulates attention remain underexplored. Recently, the principal investigator of this project demonstrated that sustained attention is disrupted by central infusions of the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in male and female rats. Sustained attention is known to be mediated by the basal forebrain.  Therefore, this project examines how CRF regulates the basal forebrain from the systems to the molecular levels. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CRF directly modulates the basal forebrain to disrupt sustained attention by combining pharmacological manipulations and a well-validated attention task. Aim 2 is to uncover the circuitry by which CRF can impact basal forebrain neurons by using retrograde tracing, cell-type specific markers, and measures of neuronal activation. Aim 3 is to identify molecular changes induced by CRF in cholinergic basal forebrain neurons by using Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting in combination with next generation sequencing. The findings will improve our fundamental understanding of how stress affects cognition. The rich sequencing data resulting from this work is an important resource for researchers studying attention circuits, and is to be made publicly available for use by other investigators. The project's education plan is designed to improve the flipped-classroom format by developing special assignments that emphasize cognitive and metacognitive techniques to promote active engagement with the out-of-class material. These assignments are made available through public media and their efficacy is examined experimentally.  The insights gained from the educational plan are to be published in education journals."

First, a small cluster of cells increases dramatically in number, then transforms into an exquisitely organized organ with a complicated pattern of connections.  Most of the time, this process results in brains that are perfectly normal, with the right number of nerve cells.  Surprisingly little is known, though, about how the growing brain decides how many cells to produce.   This research project will look at the control of cell number in the growing brains of transparent living zebrafish during the first few days of life.  The PI has developed techniques for watching clusters of dividing cells over time in special zebrafish embryos whose brain cells glow with unique combinations of colors (called ""Brainbow"").  This coloring allows new cells to be followed as they divide off from their mother cell.  So far it appears that families of cells (mother cell with her set of daughter cells) compete with other families to survive in the growing brain.  This type of competition has not been seen before in the brain, and may be responsible for controlling growth - not only in the brain, but in other organs as well.  The PI will test which genes are important for cell families to survive this competition.  The work will generate a number of new research tools that will be shared with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will perform and analyze  the experiments themselves, providing rich opportunities for research training early in developing scientists' careers.  By also transforming the data they have personally collected into an interactive, educational website, students will learn various digital media approaches to making scientific material understandable to traditional and non-traditional audiences.  The colorful images produced by this research have great appeal to both scientists and non-scientists, making it easier for students to learn how to engage the public with their work.<br/>  <br/>To study dynamic cellular behavior in the living brain, the PI has developed an approach using in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging and multicolor fluorescent protein (Brainbow) expression in zebrafish.  Using this technique, the PI has shown that programmed cell death occurs non-randomly in the living brain, with specific neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny (entire clones) undergoing cell death in a coordinated manner, while neighboring clones appear normal. If whole clones of dividing cells are in fact competing with one another, increases or decreases in cellular fitness should influence a clone's competitive edge.  The planned research will use a mosaic approach to alter gene expression in individual cells, coupled with global Brainbow expression to simultaneously follow dynamics within multiple clones of dividing cells.  Cellular fitness will be targeted via both cell-intrinsic mechanisms (cell cycle, c-myc activity) and cell-extrinsic mechanisms (access to extracellular BMP signaling).  These experiments will test directly whether cellular fitness influences a clone?s ability to survive in the developing brain.  Overall this may support the hypothesis that competition among clones of dividing cells helps regulate neuronal production and growth in the developing nervous system."

One of the largest structural changes occurring in neotropical forests is the increase in liana abundance relative to trees. This development is alarming because lianas substantially reduce tree recruitment, growth, reproduction, survival, and diversity. In fact, recent evidence indicates that the effects of increasing lianas may be so powerful that they alter the global carbon cycle, which, in turn, has serious implications for continued global climate change. Despite the profound potential ramifications of increasing liana abundance, the causes remain poorly understood. This study will use a series of cutting-edge approaches to address a pressing question in ecology: what are the putative factors responsible for the shift towards liana dominance in neotropical forests. Considering the importance of tropical forests to global diversity and the global carbon cycle, the proposed research is fundamental to understanding the ecology of tropical forests, how these critical ecosystems are changing, and how these changes may ultimately influence global climates. Broader impacts of this research include educational and international capacity building for Latin American students and biologists, and the mentoring of US-based undergraduate and graduate students. Findings of this research will be communicated to the public through both scientific and popular press articles, including articles that feature professional photographic images that illustrate important scientific concepts. <br/><br/>Given the evidence that lianas are increasing in neotropical forests and that lianas have the capacity and propensity to alter tropical forest dynamics, composition, and functioning, the proposed study is urgent and will provide critical data on the rate of liana increases and the putative factors responsible for these increases. Determining the increase in liana abundance in tropical forests will also allow a better understanding of the factors that control tropical plant abundance and distribution, one of the fundamental goals in ecology. Through a combination of approaches (large-scale demographic, fine-scale physiology and growth, and experimental manipulation of multiple factors), this research will identify the liana species in central Panama that are increasing, determine the suite of morphological and physiological functional traits that explain the increase in those species, and experimentally test the most likely factors responsible for liana increases (disturbance, drought, elevated CO2, and nitrogen deposition). By understanding the causes of liana increases, the project will address important basic and applied ecological issues. The mentoring and training of graduate and undergraduate students and biologists from both the US and from Latin America is an integral part of the project."

These mutualisms are important for stabilizing pristine natural communities, restoring degraded environments, and plant productivity in agricultural systems. Rhizobial bacteria (rhizobia) benefit leguminous host plants (peas, beans, soybean) by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms, essentially fertilizing their plant hosts. As a result, legumes are high in nitrogen and provide an abundant source of plant-derived protein. Rhizobial strains, however, are diverse in nature and vary quite a bit in partner quality, or the level of benefits they provide to the plant host. This project focuses on a genetic model system (the legume Medicago truncatula and its partner bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti) to investigate the range of partner quality variation and its underlying molecular basis in rhizobia, integrating various approaches including whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression, and metabolomics. These techniques provide insight into the genetic determinants and cellular-level metabolism that characterizes highly-beneficial interactions, versus low-quality interactions that are less beneficial for plant hosts. Understanding what determines partner quality at a mechanistic level is critical foundational knowledge that informs efforts to engineer the plant microbiome as part of plant improvement programs and sustainable crop production. Moreover a basic understanding of what determines partner quality is important for understanding how mutualisms evolve through time and how crucial mutualisms persist in current environments. This project provides biological and computational training at the undergraduate and graduate level, provides internships for local community college students, and generates online outreach and analysis tools.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>Mutualists in nature vary widely in partner quality, often with important implications for natural and managed systems, yet the molecular basis of mutualist partner quality variation is not well-understood. Recently studies have demonstrated mutualism decline in response to environmental changes, resulting from dis-association of partners, ecological shifts towards less-mutualistic species, or evolutionary decreases in mean partner quality. A predictive understanding of mutualisms is needed to understand their coevolution, persistence, and potential decline. This project will integrate natural genetic variation with physiological and molecular traits into symbiosis networks to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying the mutualism between the rhizobium Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti and its host plant Medicago truncatula. The central hypothesis is that naturally-occurring variation can be used to better resolve the genetic regulation of plant and rhizobium metabolic pathways that contribute to high-quality symbiosis. This project integrates rhizobium genome-wide nucleotide variation with both rhizobia and host plant phenotypic and molecular traits to address the molecular basis of rhizobium partner quality (how much rhizobia benefit their plant hosts), a trait relevant to both natural and managed ecosystems. Network analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data will result in comparative models of high and low quality symbiosis, enabling gene-to-trait predictions for the ecologically- and evolutionarily- important symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. Hypotheses generated by network analysis will be validated in both rhizobia and host plant systems for physiological and molecular phenotypes underlying important partner quality traits."

Plant cells have the ability to detect and respond to auxin. Thus, characterizing the network of molecular components that involved in detection and response will improve our understanding of the multiple auxin effects. The primary goal of this project is to identify the auxin-regulated molecular networks in corn, an economically important crop in USA. Characterizing the roles these networks play in the growth and development in the tassel and ear of corn will help devise strategies to improve yields. A team of scientists from four different American universities will carry out this work using the most modern biological techniques. This work will fundamentally change the landscape of developmental biology in corn, and will significantly accelerate the transfer of knowledge from the lab to the field. Results from this work will made publically available. The research team is strongly committed to mentoring a diverse group of future scientists and to increasing broad scientific literacy. This project will organize workshops aimed at expanding the professional skillsets of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees. Scientists from the four institutions will collaborate to develop training modules that will involve hands-on experimentation. These modules will specifically target audiences from K-12 schools, colleges, and the public at large.<br/><br/>This project addresses a cornerstone of developmental biology: how auxin action is specified by context-specific deployment of signaling components, and in particular, how auxin controls reproductive organogenesis. Team members have amassed a wealth of genetic, genomic and molecular resources in maize to answer the question of how axillary meristems are initiated to give rise to the reproductive structures in the tassel and ear. Prior work has shown that components of the auxin signaling machinery are expressed in three functional domains within the inflorescence: the suppressed bract leaf, the boundary domain, and the axillary meristem. Connecting auxin signaling modules with tissue-level events will require a detailed understanding of which interactions occur in specific tissues and at specific times. This challenge will be met with a highly integrated approach incorporating genomic and synthetic biology tools with sophisticated informatics and data visualization. Specifically, this project will: 1) define and characterize the auxin signaling modules (receptors, repressors, transcription factors) operating within functional domains of the inflorescence; and 2) construct gene regulatory networks incorporating co-expressed genes and targets of the auxin signaling modules."

If successful, this EAGER project will harness and exploit known molecular mechanisms of uptake and transport of soil N to facilitate these processes for airborne N. The results generated from this exploratory and high risk research may also point the way to similar strategies for N use in other species and for other important gaseous pollutants. This project will foster intellectual and technical exchange in U.S. and Africa in the area of molecular plant physiology to develop novel strategies for ""pollutant"" utilization in important crop species such as cassava, rice and potato. <br/><br/><br/>Certain air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen dioxide, are absorbed by leaves and are potential sources of nitrogen (N) needed for plant growth. However, plants did not evolve to take up these compounds from the air, and even if the nutrients are absorbed they may not be utilized correctly. Indeed, it has been noted primarily by ecophysiologists and forest biologists that these aerial nutrients stimulate shoot growth under certain conditions. However, it is also the case that the newly formed organic compounds are not transported out of the leaves, sequestering not only the absorbed N, but much of the carbon (C) derived from photosynthesis. As a result, root growth is inhibited, leaving the plants susceptible to drought and other stresses. In addition, the edible parts of crop plants, including tubers, do not benefit from nutrients if they stagnate in the leaves. To address this challenge, this EAGER project will develop and test novel molecular strategies for increasing the absorption and transport of aerial-derived nitrogenous compounds in potato, cassava and rice using select candidate genes identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis.

Efficient photosynthesis is the key to plant productivity, but soil salinity disrupts electrolytes, the so-called ion balance, in the leaf cells where photosynthesis occurs. Soil salinity is a growing problem globally and will affect worldwide food supplies if not effectively controlled. Deciphering how a plant responds to salinity and regulates its cellular ion fluxes is essential to understanding and potentially improving photosynthesis. This  project identifies specific genes that control ion fluxes and responses to salinity in plants using a specialized imaging system and analysis tools to study their role in plant productivity. The international team will use their findings to develop a computational model to inform and improve breeding programs and to develop more highly productive plants that can tolerate soil salinity.

By pursing multi-day phenotyping with dynamic growth lighting, the team has isolated new candidate thylakoid ion flux mutants. The researchers will study the compromised genes and their link to known thylakoid ion flux mediators by pursuing the following aims: (i) complete the thylakoid ion transport protein inventory; (ii) determine the role of thylakoid ion flux interactions in photosynthesis and hyperosmotic stress resistance; (iii) identify the process by which thylakoid ion flux impacts the hyperosmotic stress response; (iv) analyze thylakoid ion flux impacts on key agronomical traits in crop plants; and (v) generate a model for simulating increases to photosynthetic efficiency and salt stress resistance as a function of thylakoid ion flux.

With clear evidence that growth conditions in the field have become more adverse recently, a detailed understanding on how abiotic stress impacts this reaction pathway is needed. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect photosynthesis and plant productivity will be key to improving these pathways and thus securing necessary levels of global food production.

Molecular-genetic studies of the 20th century yielded benefits for agriculture, by showing the roles that genes play in crop biology, guiding the hands of plant breeders to produce better crops for farmers. In the 21st century far more information is available about the DNA sequences of plant genomes, but this wealth of information still requires experimental analysis to understand how it can be used to proper effect in plant breeding. This project will develop new approaches to studying sets of genes from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, measuring the way that slight differences in individual gene functions can lead to broad effects on plant health. Specifically, this project addresses genes involved in the plant immune response to herbivores and microbial pests. Plant immune responses are directed by a small set of chemical messengers, known as plant hormones, and the genes studied in this project convert this chemical message into an immune response. Conceptual approaches and laboratory methods developed during this project may form the foundation for future work in crop plants, providing material for plant breeders to develop disease resistant crops.<br/><br/>This project combines approaches from systems and synthetic biology to characterize functions of genetic regulatory networks composed of seemingly redundant signaling components. Specifically the Jasmonic acid (JA) receptor system of Arabidopsis thaliana will be studied. Mathematical models of JA signaling based on differential equations will be used to guide design of minimal synthetic systems in budding yeast able to convert JA inputs into transcriptional outputs according to a range of predetermined transfer functions. Using this information CRISPR-Cas9 based transcription factors will be designed to target particular subsets of the JA network in planta. Guide RNA target genes will be chosen to carry out specific changes to the emergent properties of the system, as informed by our models. All this work relies on first being able to generate experimental data to fit parameters for relevant interaction strengths, and to do this the SynAg method, recently developed in the Klavins lab, will be adapted and expanded. SynAg relies on yeast surface display and next generation sequencing to quantify entire interaction networks in a single experiment.

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Edgar Cahoon, David R. Holding and Chi Zhang.<br/><br/>Sorghum bicolor is a multi-use crop with exceptional water- and nitrogen-use efficiency whose expanded use will likely decrease water and fertilizer consumption and create a more sustainable agricultural system. In sorghum, natural waxes cover aerial plant surfaces where they protect against dry climates and increase water-use efficiency. Waxes accumulate in sorghum to levels higher than nearly all other plant species and sorghum kernel waxes are an emerging industrial bioproduct that can be extracted during grain processing. Understanding the processes that regulate sorghum wax biosynthesis and accumulation will enable scientists and plant breeders to (1) potentially transfer some of sorghum's water efficiency to other crops such as maize; and (2) rapidly navigate routes to high-wax sorghum lines with enhanced grain value. This project seeks to identify the genes and gene networks that control sorghum wax deposition. Training objectives include functional genomics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and plant breeding. Broader impact activities include the mentoring and training of undergraduate chemistry students in the analysis of plant chemicals as well as developing a hands-on active learning module and a hands-on laboratory workshop for educating children, adults and young women about the economic, nutritional, and environmental benefits gained through the study of plant chemistry, plant diversity, and crop improvement that will inspire interest in STEM fields, education, and careers. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to combine wax biochemistry with genomics and bioinformatics to identify genes controlling sorghum wax deposition via two complimentary specific aims: (1) identify high-confidence sorghum wax gene candidates by correlating epidermis-specific transcriptomes and comprehensive wax profiles, then evaluate their functionality by performing complementation tests in Arabidopsis wax mutants; and, (2) use bulked segregant RNA-seq mapping to pinpoint causal mutations in existing sorghum mutants affected in both kernel and leaf sheath waxes (as putative transcription factor mutants). In addition to initiating and catalyzing future sorghum wax research and the further development of applications for sorghum wax knowledge, the whole tissue and epidermis-specific gene expression data collected in this project will be made accessible through public repositories as well as through the Sorghum Epidermis Gene Expression Almanac, online server that will be developed as part of this project where users can query sequences against the sorghum transcriptome and view the expression of similar genes in whole tissue and the epidermis of sorghum leaves, leaf sheathes, and developing kernels. <br/><br/>Keywords: sorghum, wax biosynthesis and deposition, functional genomics, Arabidopsis mutants, biochemistry, gene expression profiling<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. <br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. <br/><br/>This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture."

In cereal grains, endosperm composes a large proportion of the mature seed, and contains large amounts of carbohydrates and proteins, which provide more than 50% of the calories in the human diet, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Cereal endosperm also serves as a raw material for manufacturing important industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is an excellent model system for molecular genetic analysis of cereal endosperm and is the primary subject of this research project which focuses on maize early endosperm development, encompassing the time when the endosperm grows from a single cell into a multicellular structure composed of different specialized cell types.  Although the molecular mechanisms that control this developmental period have not been elucidated, they are likely to affect many economically important processes including, but not limited to, the regulation of seed size, and accumulation of starch and protein during grain filling. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Central Michigan University.      <br/><br/>To identify genetic pathways that control endosperm cell differentiation, gene expression profiling will be performed on each endosperm cell type at multiple time points; this will be accomplished through a combination of laser-capture microdissection to collect specific endosperm cell types and the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) to identify all the genes expressed in the collected tissues. This information will be used as a framework for gene-network analysis in two of the endosperm cell types: the starchy endosperm and basal transfer layer. Starchy endosperm is the major repository for starch and protein accumulation, while the basal transfer layer is important for transporting sugar and amino acid building blocks into the growing grain; both tissues are important for grain yield and quality. The gene networks will be revealed by performing gene co-expression analysis and key transcription factors will be studied with protein-DNA assays and genetic analyses.  Early endosperm development is highly sensitive to drought stress which can decrease grain yield, even if favorable moisture conditions are restored. To identify the gene-expression perturbations caused by drought stress in maize kernels, gene expression profiling will be performed with kernels from drought-stressed plants. In addition, this project will profile the genes expressed during early endosperm development in a closely related cereal, sorghum, and use comparative genomics with maize to reveal fundamental and species-specific aspects of endosperm development. Data generated can be accessed through the project website (www.grainendosperm.org) as well as through long-term repositories such as MaizeGDB and NCBI's GEO and SRA."

A major source of plant oils comes from seeds.  While research has yielded improvements in seed oil quantity and quality, there are tradeoffs for other seed attributes such as protein content and yield.  For example, plants that are bred or engineered to produce high seed oil often have decreased protein content or make fewer seeds.  The molecular mechanism driving such tradeoffs remains unclear and creates a barrier for making improved crops with specific amounts of oil and protein content.  This project seeks to unravel the genetic and molecular mechanisms related to the tradeoffs between oil, protein content, seed size, and seed set in order to enhance seed oil content of crops. By using an integrated approach, this project will investigate biochemical steps used by seeds to prioritize protein or oil production.  Using this knowledge, this project will generate plants with improved seed oil production.  In addition, this project promotes STEM education using the science of seed oils to train tomorrow's scientists as well as develops a science literacy program using hands-on research experience for students who are training to become future STEM teachers.  The scientific and educational outcomes of this project will have broad impacts for both research and society through improved oil production in crop plants.<br/><br/>Quantitative, comparative profiling of high-oil soybean, Camelina, and Arabidopsis will reveal the coordinated metabolic response to de-regulated de novo FAS.  These findings will reveal the next metabolic constraint for engineering seed oil content, discover new genes involved in acyl lipid metabolism, and provide the plant lipid community with characterized, high-oil germplasm for gene stacking and comparative genomics. This project will integrate comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and translatomics during three stages of seed development of FAS-engineered, high-oil plants to develop correlative and kinetic models to make metabolic predictions, and discover coregulated gene networks. Flux analyses and clustering models will be used to link high-oil germplasm to causal effects within combined central and lipid metabolic networks and used to make hypotheses for next-generation crop improvements. Aspects of in vivo FAS rates, the uncoupling of FAS from TAG synthesis that can lead to futile cycles of FAS and breakdown; and acyl fluxes through the lipid metabolic network will be investigated to elucidate new bottlenecks for TAG accumulation as a result of de-regulating FAS. Web resources (fatplants.net) developed as a part of this project will serve to educate the community and provide an interactive tool to integrate metabolism and gene regulation Integrated tools are necessary to inspire tomorrow's scientists and engineers and enable multidisciplinary training of all ages.

In addition, some organisms can adapt to changes in their environments within just one generation without any change in their genes.  Such ""developmental plasticity"" occurs when the environment influences how organisms develop, and allows organisms to adapt to environmental challenges more rapidly than is possible through evolutionary change.  Plasticity itself has evolved through the longer process of mutation and selection, but little is known about this evolution. This project focuses on aphids, small insects that reproduce clonally and give live birth during the summer months. The summer form, however, cannot survive a cold winter.  In the fall, when mother aphids sense that days are getting shorter, they chemically signal their embryonic offspring to develop into a form that can lay eggs that can survive the cold temperatures of winter and hatch in the spring.  The participants in this project will investigate the molecular changes that occur in developing aphid embryos when they switch from the summer to the fall form.  Participants will also investigate aphids from regions with mild winters that no longer produce the fall form and do not lay eggs, to try to understand how the response to shorter days has been lost over the course of recent evolution.  The work will take place primarily at Bryn Mawr College, a women's undergraduate institution, and thus also aims to engage young women in the design and execution of hypothesis-driven experimentation and data analysis within the discipline of evolutionary developmental biology.<br/><br/>The aphid reproductive polyphenism is poised to become an important example of genetic accommodation in natural populations, one for which a good deal is known about the developmental and endocrine basis of the plasticity.  Such progress, however, will require an accurate understanding of the fundamentals of the system.  Although several lines of evidence suggest that juvenile hormone is involved in the photoperiod response, the precise role this hormone plays in mediating the effect is not clear.  A combined approach of hormone manipulation, measurements of juvenile hormone titer, and gene expression during early specification and subsequent differentiation into the summer and fall forms will discriminate among competing hypotheses for the role that juvenile hormone plays in the process.  If successful, the experiments could demonstrate an embryonic role for juvenile hormone in the specification of reproductive fate and identify other early markers of this differentiation, providing candidates and opening new doors toward understanding the switch and how it evolves to accommodate novel environments."

The structure of centromeres is not well understood, although coordinated changes in the DNA and associated factors are necessary for centromere function. Furthermore, centromere structure and function can change over time raising questions about how the genome responds and adapt at the chromosome level. Centromeres are difficult to study because they are composed of retrotranspons and other mobile elements that consist of highly repetitive sequences. The ability to assemble spans of short repeated sequences is notoriously difficult, so the centromere regions of chromosomes have remained nearly obscure to researchers. This project will sequence and analyze the centromere regions of all ten maize chromosomes using new sequencing technologies and software tools that permit assembly and analysis of the repetitive sequences and will permit study of the associated factors unique to centromeres. The results of this project will add value to the already sequenced maize genome and will result in an improved reference genome fully available to the plant research community. By discovering the structure and function of centromeres, the potential to construct artificial chromosomes will be expanded and agronomic traits associated with centromeres may be identified. As part of the project, undergraduate students will be trained in modern plant engineering methods and synthetic biology. The team of undergraduate students will participate in an international student research competition, thus promoting student and public understanding of plant centromeres and synthetic biology. <br/><br/>Little is known about the role of DNA in centromere function and evolution. In a first step, the nature and arrangement of centromere-specific repeats at all ten maize centromeres of the inbred B73 reference genome will be determined using PacBio technology. The impact of these repeats on the deposition of centromere-specific proteins will be determined using a number of different experimental approaches, including comparative genomics and epigenomics, as well as biochemical and genetic assays. Neocentromere formation is an epigenetic change that involves movement of CENH3, the centromere specific histone H3, to a new genomic region. Rapid invasion of neocentromeres by centromeric retrotransposons (CR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the interplay of epigenetic and genetic changes. A large number of epigenetic marks have been, or are being, mapped in the standard maize genomes. Histone H2A.Z nucleosomes, which may represent persistent marks of transcribed regions, will be mapped and integrated with all available epigenetic signatures to determine the reciprocal effects of genetic (double-stranded DNA breaks and retrotransposons insertion) and epigenetic (histone variants, histone modifications, gene expression, DNA methylation). At least one additional epigenetic marker that specifically binds centromeric repeats will be characterized in detail. All data produced in the course of this research will be deposited at MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)."

Although milkweeds produce toxins that are lethal to most insects, monarch butterfly caterpillars are quite resistant and even store milkweed toxins for their own defense against predators like birds. As is indicated by the milkweed genus name, Asclepias, which is derived from Asclepius, the Greek god of healing, Native Americans used these plants to treat a variety of medical ailments. Several studies have shown that milkweeds are rich sources of novel chemical compounds that not only provide defense against insects, but also have potential medical applications. In this project the investigators will develop new resources to investigate the function of specific genes in both common milkweed and tropical milkweed. Methods will be developed to knock out or overexpress specific milkweed genes in a targeted manner. Genome sequencing of two milkweed species, together with natural variation in milkweed gene expression and chemical content, will enable the discovery of new genes involved in defense against herbivory and the production of medically relevant plant metabolites. The resources that will be developed through this project will be made publicly available as they are being generated, with no restrictions limiting their use. The project also will involve training high school students and undergraduate summer interns, which will prepare them for future research careers in industry, academia, or government service.<br/><br/>The further development of Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) and Asclepias curassavica (tropical milkweed) as research model systems will require improved tools for studying the functions of individual genes. In this project, milkweed-specific protocols will be developed for: (i) transient gene expression using Agrobacterium infiltration, (ii) virus-induced silencing of endogenous gene expression, (iii) targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9, (iv) stable transformation in tissue culture, (v) regeneration of plants from callus, and (vi) heritable modification of the milkweed genome. To facilitate functional analysis of milkweed genes, the A. syriaca and A. curassavica genomes will be assembled using Pacific Biosciences DNA sequencing. Assembled contigs will be ordered and assigned to specific chromosomes using classical genetic maps and BioNano optical maps. Milkweed genes will be identified and annotated through in silico comparisons and deep sequencing of RNA from different tissue types.

Plant gene expression and metabolite content varies dramatically in different tissue types and in response to environmental stimuli. In particular, insect attack induces the production of a wide variety of biologically active plant metabolites. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of six A. syriaca and A. curassavica tissue types, with and without herbivory treatment, will provide a broad overview of the genetic and metabolic potential of these species. Molecular protocols, genome sequences, transcriptome data, and correlative analyses linking the transcriptomes, metabolomes, and other milkweed phenotypes will be displayed on the project website, www.milkweedbase.net."

The behavior is anatomically simple, with the intestine, several muscle cells, and two neurons communicating to establish the defecation motor program (DMP). The posterior cells of the intestine are the behavioral pacemaker, and the canonical signaling cascades that regulate basal, rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations in these cells have been well-characterized. However, these oscillations also help to set metabolic homeostasis and are coupled to ion transport processes that facilitate nutrient uptake. The research supported by this award will allow us to identify the underlying mechanisms through which these processes are integrated, focusing in particular on the metabolic hub of the cell, the mitochondria. The main function of mitochondria is to transduce energy through oxidative phosphorylation, a process which generates most of the endogenous ROS in cells. However, mitochondria are also well-recognized to contribute to Ca2+ signaling by buffering Ca2+. Recent groundbreaking work has uncovered novel molecular mechanisms that contribute to Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria, to maintaining organelle-specific protein homeostasis, and to signaling through ROS. Each of the aims in this study is intended to query these specific aspects of mitochondria's function with respect to their effect on oscillatory Ca2+ signaling. We will investigate the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in maintaining behavioral rhythmicity and metabolic homeostasis.

In this project, a series of experiments will define how the first connection to the digestive system is formed, and how its development is intimately tied to the formation of surrounding facial structures. Specifically, the hypothesis is that growth and tension within the face pulls the mouth open. Molecular, cellular, embryological and biomechanical approaches in Xenopus will be combined to test this hypothesis. Based on preliminary data it is expected that novel connections between molecular signals, cellular junctions, such as desmosomes, and mitosis will be uncovered. This work is potentially high impact in that it is the first to study: 1) the role of tension in orofacial development and 2) the molecular mechanisms governing how the connection to the digestive system is established. Additionally, this work is integrated into an innovative educational plan. Graduate and undergraduate level laboratory courses will be created where students will perform experiments contributing to the project. In addition, undergraduate independent study and summer research projects are planned for VCU's minority programs.

In addition to the widely conserved endomesoderm, spiralians have a second novel source of mesoderm (ectomesoderm) that may be tied to the origin of larval body plans in this clade. Unlike endomesoderm, ectomesoderm undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of ectomesoderm are poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have not been constructed for either endo- or ectomesoderm in any spiralian. This project has two specific aims: I. Determine cellular mechanisms that regulate ectomesoderm formation and II. Determine molecular mechanisms that regulate development of spiralian endo- and ectomesoderm. Experiments in Aim I will determine the role of cell-cell interactions vs. cell autonomous factors in regulating ectomesoderm formation by combining lineage tracing, laser cell ablation and fluorescence time-lapse imaging. In Aim II, a combination of gene expression analyses and molecular loss-of-function assays will decipher endo- and ectomesoderm GRNs. Comparisons of these GRNs will validate hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origins of endo- and ectomesoderm. This research may uncover novel interactions between genes regulating mesoderm formation and those involved in EMT. Comparisons with previous studies in other systems will provide a better understanding of gastrulation and body plan evolution amongst the Metazoa.

For example, as animals feed, their strategies for acquiring food changes. The impact of food odors has a very different effect on a hungry person than one who has just had a large meal. This project brings together laboratories from the Case Western Reserve University Biology department and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to examine changes in hunting strategy that occur as praying mantises feed. The biology laboratory will examine changes in brain systems that control movement as the insect feeds or receives injections of hormones associated with feeding. Insects provide advantages for monitoring brain activity for long feeding periods. Results will demonstrate how brain systems that are altered by hormones associated with feeding affect hunting and will increase our general understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal changes alter animal behavior. The museum laboratory will expand the study to a wider range of praying mantis species. The project also has a unique educational component. Project related material will be developed into new high- and middle-school teaching modules for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's award winning distance learning program, which has reached thousands of students in 48 states. These programs align with Ohio's New Learning Standards. Modules will be offered for free for the duration of the project and 3 subsequent years.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the highly structured central complex insect brain region that has received much recent attention. Numerous forms of sensory information coupled with motor effects and the presence of behaviorally relevant neuromodulators imply an important role for the central complex in behavioral adaptation. Yet, no study has brought all these components together to demonstrate how these brain circuits generate context dependent adjustments in natural behavior. This project seeks do that by relating changes in praying mantis hunt strategies to central complex activity patterns recorded by multi-channel tetrode implants as the hunt takes place in one generalist and two specialist praying mantis species. Tetrode wires will be implanted in the insect's central complex. Then after recovery the subject will be moved to an arena where it hunts either live prey (cockroach nymphs) or artificial prey (moving dots on a computer screen that makes up the floor of the arena). The artificial stimulus allows repeated trials to provide quantitative data on neural activity associated with hunting. Neural and behavioral changes will be documented as physiological state is modified by feeding or insulin injection. Comparative studies will clarify how evolution acts on brain structures to shape behavior for specific niches. Successful completion will be transformative both in our understanding of the central complex's role in behavioral adjustment and, more generally, in defining mechanisms by which brain regions in all animals can alter adaptive behavior, thereby establishing the praying mantis as a new general model for behavioral selection."

Understanding how organisms cope physiologically with naturally variable environments will be important for predicting organismal responses, including those in humans, to increasingly unpredictable environments characterized by frequent extreme weather events like droughts and floods. And since coping mechanisms themselves, short-term physiological and behavioral responses, respond to environmental variation over longer time periods, a comparative approach is needed to fully understand how organisms have historically responded to climatic uncertainty. To determine how vertebrates adapt to and cope with environmental variation at the physiological and molecular level, this study will simultaneously explore patterns of genetic and epigenetic variation in genes of birds that underlie the stress response and the entire genome across an ecological gradient in Kenya, and then relate this variation to patterns of gene expression in naturally variable and experimentally-controlled climates. This study will train high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in the field and lab. Training will emphasize cutting-edge, integrative tools that are transferable across disciplines. Researchers will work closely with a grassroots Kenyan conservation organization to educate rural schoolchildren on conservation and wildlife through a series of teaching modules and public representations. Finally, researchers will present the results of their work locally around New York City and in popular articles aimed at a diverse audience.<br/><br/>One of the primary ways that vertebrates cope physiologically with environmental variability is through changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress. The HPA axis encompasses a cascade of hormones, receptors, and other molecules, each of which may respond to different types and timescales of environmental variation. Although understanding how the HPA axis responds to environmental variability is important for determining how organisms will cope with environmental uncertainty because it is one of the first ways that vertebrates respond to environmental stressors, many other physiological, endocrine, and molecular pathways are also impacted by environmental stressors. Therefore, a genome-wide approach that links molecular mechanisms and adaptive genetic and epigenetic variation more broadly to physiological function will be necessary to understand how animals adapt to and cope with environmental uncertainty. The objective of this study is to determine how environmental variation influences adaptive genetic (DNA sequence) and epigenetic variation (DNA methylation), gene function (mRNA expression), and physiological responses (hormone activity) to shape particular phenotypes in populations of free-living superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus) sampled across a broad-scale ecological gradient in sub-Saharan Africa encompassing some of the most unpredictable climatic zones in the world. Building upon long-term data in African starlings, and using a series of newly-established populations along an ecological gradient in Kenya, this work will allow researchers to begin to understand how environmentally-induced selection pressures shape the molecular mechanisms, adaptive evolutionary responses, and coping strategies that vertebrates use to live with environmental uncertainty."

Deciphering this poorly understood yet fundamental aspect of plant biology will shed light on the evolution of tree species and have important implications for forest ecology and growth dynamics.   In a practical sense, the work will help transform the orchards and tree plantations of the future through the development of tree varieties suitable for high density planting- achieving productivity improvements analogous to those accomplished for cereal crops over the past half century. Commercial planting of these improved varieties will lead to more efficient land space utilization, reduction of chemical inputs, and increased industry profitability and sustainability.  To integrate education and research and broaden participation, the project will provide research training in plant genomics for undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented minority groups.  In addition, the project will organize and hold a series of workshops on plant architecture and biotechnology solutions that will educate growers and agricultural industry personnel about specific benefits biotechnology has to offer tree crops. Finally, the project will develop and hold short courses on a novel sequence-based mapping and gene identification method using pooled genomes or pnomes for fellow scientists working on trees and other horticultural crops.  All data generated in this project will be accessible to the public through the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) Short Reads Archive databases and/or the Genome Database for Rosaceae (http://www.rosaceae.org/). <br/><br/>Trees can adopt a wide variety of architectural forms. Architectural plasticity plays important roles in forest ecosystems, agriculture, and landscape aesthetics. Tree architecture is a consequence of numerous developmental traits that include branching pattern, branch number, branch length, and branch angle. These traits are largely a function of two key developmental processes: apical dominance and apical control.  Apical dominance is a well understood process that inhibits lateral bud outgrowth through signals emanating from the shoot apex. Intensive studies have revealed the signals and the underlying molecular mechanisms that operate in herbaceous plants such as Arabidopsis and pea. In contrast, apical control is the process by which the apex influences the overall tree structure upon successive years of growth and development in woody species. Although some progress has been made from a physiological perspective, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of apical control are largely unknown.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop detailed knowledge about how trees adopt specific architectural forms, specifically with regard to apical control of the lateral branch angle and directional growth.  Using a combination of genome-scale studies to elucidate key gene networks and molecular pathways coupled with innovative whole tree imaging technologies that will enable non-destructive structural phenotyping, the project will address the following questions: 1) What gene expression networks differentiate the shoot apical meristem from lateral meristems? What changes take place when a lateral shoot meristem transitions to becoming the apical meristem? How are these expression networks altered in branch angle mutants including pillar/columnar tree forms and weeping types? 2) What is the genetic and molecular basis for these mutant tree forms in peach and apple? What are the identities of the mutated genes? 3) With regard to the identified genes, what protein-protein interaction networks are they associated with? Through which pathways do they exert their effects on tree form?"

In vertebrates, this process controls graft rejection and auto-immune responses.  In colonial invertebrates -- animals like marine sponges, corals, and sea squirts -- this ability is called allorecognition. Allorecognition controls whether colonies aggressively compete for space or peacefully coexist when they encounter one another as they grow. Despite the biological significance of this phenomenon, the genes and proteins that underlie it remain poorly understood. In this project, the investigators will study the molecular basis of allorecognition in a cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Recently, two genes controlling allorecognition in Hydractinia have been identified. The investigators will determine how the proteins encoded by these genes allow Hydractinia to properly distinguish self from non-self. To do this, the investigators will combine biochemical experiments with computer modeling and x-ray crystallography to build a structural model of the proteins, which will reveal how they enable Hydractinia to discriminate between self and non-self. This knowledge will fill a significant gap in our understanding of invertebrate allorecognition and form the basis of future work to investigate how these phenomena evolve. As part of their work, the investigators will train two undergraduates, two graduate students, and one postdoc in protein biochemistry and structure determination. They will provide opportunities for three high school students to conduct independent research projects in their laboratories. They will also develop and implement an educational program about Hydractinia for elementary school students in southwestern Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>In Hydractinia, two allorecognition proteins, Alr1 and Alr2, discriminate between self and non-self. Preliminary studies indicate these proteins engage in isoform-specific binding across cell membranes. This binding is hypothesized to be a general feature of both proteins and to be mediated by trans interactions between immunoglobulin superfamily-like (IgSF-like) domains in their extracellular regions and the formation of disulphide-linked cis multimers. Aim 1 will identify segments in the extracellular regions of each protein that control binding specificity and test whether the proteins form cis multimers via disulphide bonds. Aim 2 will identify amino acid positions within these segments that determine their binding profiles and use computational modeling to explore hypothesized binding mechanisms. Together, Aims 1 and 2 will be used to create a structural model of isoform-specific binding. Aim 3 will validate this model by determining the crystal structures of the extracellular domains of Alr1 and Alr2. Our team combines three PIs with expertise in invertebrate allorecognition, computational biology, and x-ray crystallography. The expected outcome of this project will be the first mechanistic understanding of how allorecognition proteins discriminate between self and non-self in any invertebrate. Comparison of this structural mechanism with those in other self-recognition systems will reveal which aspects of molecular recognition are unique to Hydractinia and which are shared with other species. The data generated in this project will guide future projects investigating how sequence evolution at allorecognition genes leads to novel allorecognition specificities and how signaling through the allorecognition proteins regulates allorecognition responses."

PG is unique to these microorganisms. It is essential for bacterial survival, and has a remarkably conserved structure throughout diverse bacterial groups. PG is not found in plants and animals, and given its essentialness and conservation in bacteria, it is an excellent target for antibiotics and innate immunity. Thus, PG is a focus of strategies for bacterial detection and control. Blocking the ability of bacteria to make a normal PG structure is generally lethal, yet in rare instances bacteria with novel PG have evolved naturally. This project uses the model animal-associated bacterium Vibrio fischeri to explore what happens when PG is experimentally forced to evolve. The results will shed light on the natural evolution of peptidoglycan, on the constraints of its function in bacteria, and on the limits of targeting PG as a means of controlling bacteria. Moreover, V. fischeri is a natural symbiotic bacterium that colonizes a Hawaiian squid, and PG is a key signaling molecule in this symbiosis. Thus, it offers the opportunity to examine how peptidoglycan structure affects the ability of host animal tissue to detect and respond to its resident bacteria (i.e., its microbiome). The broader impacts of this work for society include interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate student training, outreach to community K-12 schools, and contributions to a book on bacterial symbionts geared for use in the classroom. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate how unusual changes to bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan (PG) structure can evolve, and it will help define constraints on PG evolution. This project will examine how the tractable bacterium Vibrio fischeri can evolve new PG structure(s) using a strategy of iteratively blocking both normal and alternative pathways to PG biosynthesis. Viable mutants generating novel PG will be selected. Such mutants are likely to have distinctly non-wild-type properties of growth, cell shape, motility, etc.; however, rounds of growth in culture will lead to evolved strains that have accommodated the new PG. A combination of phenotypic testing and whole-genome resequencing will underpin a systems-type analysis of these evolved strains. The integrated analysis of genetic and phenotypic data will improve our understanding of how the cell wall is coordinated with other cellular components and processes, and it will lead to the discovery of new phenotypically important interconnections in bacterial cells. The results will inform our understanding of the natural evolution of PG and lead to a more predictive understanding of how PG might evolve in the future, e.g. under selective pressure from antibiotic use. V. fischeri is a symbiont in a model squid symbiosis, in which symbiont PG triggers developmental changes in the host. This study will provide insight into the relationship between PG structure and its function in this symbiosis, with broader implications for understanding innate immunity in higher organisms."

The circadian clock is an endogenous timing system that exists in all kingdoms of life, from bacteria to animals. Its main function is to enable the integration of environmental signals and metabolic status to ensure that organisms perform necessary tasks at biologically advantageous times of day. It is known that protein-protein interactions are important in the transduction of circadian timing information within an organism.  Although a number of key conserved proteins that make up the core oscillator in the circadian timing system have been identified in animals, the mechanisms by which the oscillator protein module receives input time cues and subsequently transduces this timing information to generate physiological rhythms are not well understood. In this project, protein network analysis centering on the oscillator protein module in three insect species with distinct clock designs will be conducted using mass spectrometry-based analyses over a circadian timeframe. Algorithms will be developed to model the dynamic changes in the network connections between the oscillator and cellular protein complexes with respect to circadian as well as evolutionary time. This project will uncover previously unknown protein interactions and shed light on the dynamic protein network rewiring necessary for properly timed biological activities. This project will provide training opportunities and career development for graduate students, undergraduates, high school teachers and students from K-12 levels. Exhibits showcasing insect circadian rhythms will be organized at the Bohart Museum of Entomology at UC Davis. Laboratory workshops providing hands on laboratory experience will be organized to benefit high school teachers and students. Video training tools will be developed as resources for laboratory workshops and for training students involved in this project.<br/><br/>This project aims to profile and model temporally-regulated and dynamic protein networks centered on core transcription factors that make up the circadian oscillators in three insect species, Drosophila melanogaster, the Monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus, and the honeybee Apis mellifera. Interactomic comparisons between these relatively closely related insect species with distinct clock designs will be valuable not only in identifying conserved and likely important cellular protein modules for clockworks, but also in highlighting network rewiring and differential interactions that can reflect inherent flexibility and adaptability of the clock network. Results from this project will lay the foundation for testing new hypotheses regarding animal clockwork and predicting the behavior of the clock system in response to perturbations. Since protein networks are tissue and cell-type specific, a novel framework to overcome current limits of mass spectroscopy sensitivity and model cell-type specific protein networks from network data assembled from broader tissue samples using a trans-omics approach will be tested. This project will develop proteomic methods as well as bioinformatic tools for understanding a dynamic and oscillating biological system, all of which will be valuable to the scientific community."

Adult crayfish are used for this research because the cell populations that produce new neurons are much easier to study and manipulate than in other animals commonly used for this type of research. Unlike neural stem cells in other animals such as mice, the population of cells that directly produces new neurons in adult brains do not self-renew; rather, this population appears to be replenished by cells coming from some other source in the body. Previous data indicate that the immune system provides these precursor cells to the adult crayfish brain. The goal of this proposal is to build on this previous research to definitively identify how the immune system contributes to the generation of adult-born neurons. The experiments are designed to test three hypotheses. The first aim examines the hypothesis that circulating blood/immune cells (hemocytes) interact with specific physical locations in the crayfish brain (neurogenic niches), that cause these cells to remain and produce descendants that differentiate into neurons. The second aim examines the hypothesis that hemocytes are chemically attracted to the neurogenic niches by specific molecules. The third aim examines the hypothesis that the nervous system regulates the production of the neural precursors by the immune system via the release of a chemical (serotonin) that biochemically modulates the fate of immune system cells. By clearly identifying these cellular and molecular influences, these studies will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how stem cells enable the production of new neurons in adult brains. This work also contributes to society through training undergraduates in stem cell research, and educating the general public about the value of non-mammalian biological research and the potential for life-long plasticity in the nervous system.<br/><br/>In this project, GFP-positive (GFP+) hemocytes originating in transgenic crayfish will be adoptively transferred to recipient non-transgenic animals, and their target organs and differentiated properties will be determined. In addition, GFP+ cells extracted from different regions of the immune system in transgenic crayfish will be used in adoptive transfers to define the tissue origins of cells that are competent to produce adult-born neurons. These studies will also identify local guidance cues that attract hemocytes to the neurogenic niche using in vitro cell migration assays, as well as in situ nucleic acid hybridization and immunocytochemistry to locate candidate molecules that have been identified by transcriptome analyses. Finally, the coordinated regulation of the innate immune system and adult neurogenesis by a 5-HT-activated cytokine (astakine 1; AST1) pathway will be tested. Differential expression and localization of AST1 in niche, brain and immune tissues will be assessed after altering 5-HT levels. By testing the hypothesis that cells originating in the innate immune system produce adult-born neurons, these studies challenge the canonical view that the ectodermal origins of embryonic neural tissues are the sole source of neurons in the adult brain."

The cues that stop growth are not fully understood, even in well-studied model species. Solitary bees provision their offspring, restricting the food available for larval growth. Experiments indicate that the complete consumption of these provisions induces metamorphosis. Studying the cues to metamorphosis in solitary bees provides a unique opportunity to physiologically compare individuals of the same age and size that either have or have not transitioned to metamorphosis. The proposed research will investigate (1) whether the hormonal cues underlying starvation-triggered metamorphosis in solitary bees are the same as those found in insects that metamorphose upon reaching a particular size, (2) how variation in the timing of metamorphosis predicts body size variation in natural populations and different bee species, and (3) how the determinants of adult size in bees shape differences between queens and workers in honeybees. Bee body size predicts pollination performance, and a physiological understanding of body size control has direct implications for pollinator health and performance in both natural and managed bee species, whether solitary or social. Undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will participate in this research, and K-12 learning modules on pollinator life cycles will be developed.<br/><br/>Body size is an important organismal trait that correlates with most aspects of performance and fitness. In determinant-growing organisms, body size becomes fixed at maturation; therefore the mechanisms regulating maturation also influence size variation among individuals. Insects grow as larvae until attainment of a critical weight, at which point the mechanisms regulating metamorphosis are irreversibly initiated. This established model of body size control may not be generalizable to species with larval ecologies that differ from model insect species. Preliminary data demonstrate that completely consuming the larval provision initiates metamorphosis in the solidary bee Osmia lignaria. This result challenges the existing conceptual model for insect body size by suggesting that the critical weight is not a universal trait in insects. The proposed research will address three central aims: 1) characterizing the physiological regulation of metamorphosis in the solitary bee Osmia lignaria, 2) characterizing factors determining body size variation among populations and species of solitary bees that share similar larval ecologies; and 3) testing the degree to which diet quantity contributes to caste differences in eusocial bees. These mechanisms have the potential to explain much of the body size variation observed among Hymenopterans. Finally, the proposed research will develop a mechanistically explicit understanding of body size determination for bees, which are key pollinators for natural and managed ecosystems. A deeper, mechanistic understanding of body size variation may yield insights into improving pollinator health at the scale of individuals or even populations.  Results from these studies will be disseminated in peer reviewed journals and through presentations at scientific meetings."

Thus, studying gene regulatory networks is crucial to understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern early neural development.  The Zic1 transcription factor plays multiple and critical roles in early neural development, for example when neural tissue is first set aside and later during formation of the cerebellum.  Despite its critical roles in regulating genes during early neural development, little is known about the molecular pathways that are regulated by this transcription factor.  A screen conducted in the PI's laboratory was designed to identify genes that are directly regulated by Zic1.  Four of these genes are the focus of the proposed studies.  The first is an aquaglyceroporin (aqp-3b), which is specifically expressed in the neural folds.  It is expected to be involved in closure of the neural tube.  Three additional genes (cpl-1, CRABP-II, and SRC-3) promote retinoic acid signaling, which plays critical roles in hindbrain development.  The experiments in this project aim to identify a mechanism through which Zic1 regulates neural tube closure and may show that Zic1 is a previously unknown modulator of retinoic acid signaling.  Together, the data from these experiments will significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which the transcription factor Zic1 regulates early neural development. <br/><br/>The objectives of the educational activities are to integrate research and teaching by developing a research-based course that introduces a larger group of students to hands-on research than is possible in an individual research laboratory and will allow development of lasting skills in independent inquiry-based thinking.  The undergraduates will examine additional direct target genes of the Zic1 transcription factor.  The resulting projects will be continued inside the classroom in subsequent years of the course, and outside the classroom by undergraduate students in independent research projects within the PI's laboratory.  Thus, the course will help attract talented undergraduate students into the laboratory, who might previously not have considered research an option.  Further, outreach activities to middle schools and tribal colleges will provide teaching opportunities for undergraduate students that will foster a deeper understanding of their own work and contribute to BRIDGES, a program that facilitates the transition of Native American students from tribal colleges to four-year institutions."

These relatively simple multicellular organisms provide an excellent, cost-effective model system for studying fundamental aspects of developmental biology. Additionally, because these bacteria are relatively easy to modify genetically, and are capable of both converting sunlight into energy and providing a source of nitrogen-based fertilizer to certain plants, they are of considerable interest for development in biofuel production and agriculture. This project is focused on characterizing the genetic mechanism controlling the development of specialized filaments that are capable of movement, using the model strain Nostoc punctiforme. As part of the broader impacts, this project will also provide training for both undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the art genetic and molecular techniques, as well as an outreach program to local area schools which serve a diverse student body, many of whom are economically disadvantaged. Aspects of this project will be incorporated into teaching labs and several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research, including students recruited from the Community Involvement Program (C.I.P.) at University of the Pacific, which serves first generation college students from ethnically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Students recruited from C.I.P. will be provided support for summer research assistantships and also participate in an outreach program for 5th-8th grade classrooms at local schools where they will disseminate a learning module using a portable fluorescence microscope to explore cell biology.<br/><br/>Filamentous cyanobacteria are among the most developmentally complex prokaryotes and the study of these organisms has provided valuable insight into developmental biology. Many species develop an array of specialized cell types including motile filaments termed hormogonia that facilitate dispersal. Hormogonia are also essential for the formation of supracellular structures and the establishment of nitrogen-fixing plant- and fungal-cyanobacterial symbioses that contribute significantly to global nitrogen fixation. Currently, the underlying molecular interactions controlling hormogonium development and ecologically important hormogonium-dependent processes are largely undefined. Based on recent studies and preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that hormogonium development is governed by a conserved gene regulatory network that includes sigma factors, partner-switching regulatory systems, the hmp chemotaxis system, and several additional uncharacterized components. This project has two specific aims: 1) Identify and characterize components of the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development, and 2) Define the role of sigma factors and partner-switching regulatory systems in hormogonium development. The project uses forward and reverse genetic approaches combined with a range of phenotypic analyses of mutant strains including morphological analyses and immunological assays of hormogonium-specific protein and polysaccharide expression, as well as transcriptomic studies to define the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development in the model filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. Completion of this project will lay the foundation for a model of the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development that can then be used to rationally design genetically modified strains of filamentous cyanobacteria for various applications including biofuel production and novel plant-cyanobacterial symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If flowering time is delayed, reproduction may be insufficient or may fail if seed set is not achieved by the end of the growing season. In contrast, if the transition to flowering is too rapid, the full length of the growing season may not be utilized for optimizing reproduction. As a result, shifts in flowering time can alter plant productivity, disrupt plant-pollinator interactions, and affect food production in crops. Climate change is expected to have major impacts on the flowering times of plants. While some species are known to have flowered earlier over the last century in response to warming, others may be more influenced by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, or both factors combined. Little is known about the mechanisms that drive elevated carbon dioxide effects on flowering time. This may prove problematic, since over half of plant species are known to exhibit major alterations in flowering time when grown at elevated carbon dioxide levels predicted for 50 years into the future. Such responses will have global implications since carbon dioxide is rising across the planet. The overall goal of this research is to better understand the linkages between growth, physiological, and molecular mechanisms that control flowering time in response to both rising carbon dioxide and temperature across contemporary through future time scales. The Principal Investigator will help develop the new ""Flower and Food Garden of Southwest Middle School"" in Lawrence, KS, which will be an educational garden where students will apply current adaptation strategies in planting times under climate change scenarios and will measure food production. This will enable students to conduct hands-on research, analyze their own data, and report their findings to the community. Moreover, these outreach efforts will help to develop a more informed society on the effects of climate change on plants. These efforts will also promote a stronger workforce that will enable strategies to overcome the negative effects of climate change on food production through increased understanding of plant mechanistic responses to the environment.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to better understand the linkages between growth, physiological, and molecular mechanisms that control flowering time (FLT) in response to both rising [CO2] and temperature across pre-industrial through future conditions. In preliminary studies with field-collected genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, it was determined that rising [CO2] was the main driver of accelerated FLTs between preindustrial and modern conditions, while surprisingly, the addition of higher temperature reduced or eliminated this response. These are among the first results to delineate the effects of rising [CO2] and temperature that occurred over the last century on FLT. Furthermore, between modern and future conditions, high levels of variation were observed among genotypes for FLT responses, which would have major ecological and evolutionary implications if represented in other species. It is becoming increasingly clear that the influence of increasing [CO2] and temperature on FLT is not simply due to effects on growth rate. Rather, physiological responses and metabolite production can affect signaling mechanisms that influence flowering gene expression and alter the timing and size at which plants flower in response to climate change factors. Therefore, the proposed research takes an integrative approach to determine how the upstream effects of whole-plant growth, leaf-level physiology, and metabolite production interact to influence downstream effects on flowering gene expression and ultimately FLT in model plants and crops. Path analysis is used to determine the causal pathways that are most likely influencing FLT in response to [CO2] and temperature. Ultimately, the physiological, developmental, and molecular understanding developed in this research will increase the ability to predict FLT responses to contemporary and future changes in climate. The PI has a strong track-record of mentoring undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented populations, and this will continue throughout this research."

For example, as animals feed, their strategies for acquiring food changes. The impact of food odors has a very different effect on a hungry person than one who has just had a large meal. This project brings together laboratories from the Case Western Reserve University Biology department and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to examine changes in hunting strategy that occur as praying mantises feed. The biology laboratory will examine changes in brain systems that control movement as the insect feeds or receives injections of hormones associated with feeding. Insects provide advantages for monitoring brain activity for long feeding periods. Results will demonstrate how brain systems that are altered by hormones associated with feeding affect hunting and will increase our general understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal changes alter animal behavior. The museum laboratory will expand the study to a wider range of praying mantis species. The project also has a unique educational component. Project related material will be developed into new high- and middle-school teaching modules for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's award winning distance learning program, which has reached thousands of students in 48 states. These programs align with Ohio's New Learning Standards. Modules will be offered for free for the duration of the project and 3 subsequent years.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the highly structured central complex insect brain region that has received much recent attention. Numerous forms of sensory information coupled with motor effects and the presence of behaviorally relevant neuromodulators imply an important role for the central complex in behavioral adaptation. Yet, no study has brought all these components together to demonstrate how these brain circuits generate context dependent adjustments in natural behavior. This project seeks do that by relating changes in praying mantis hunt strategies to central complex activity patterns recorded by multi-channel tetrode implants as the hunt takes place in one generalist and two specialist praying mantis species. Tetrode wires will be implanted in the insect's central complex. Then after recovery the subject will be moved to an arena where it hunts either live prey (cockroach nymphs) or artificial prey (moving dots on a computer screen that makes up the floor of the arena). The artificial stimulus allows repeated trials to provide quantitative data on neural activity associated with hunting. Neural and behavioral changes will be documented as physiological state is modified by feeding or insulin injection. Comparative studies will clarify how evolution acts on brain structures to shape behavior for specific niches. Successful completion will be transformative both in our understanding of the central complex's role in behavioral adjustment and, more generally, in defining mechanisms by which brain regions in all animals can alter adaptive behavior, thereby establishing the praying mantis as a new general model for behavioral selection."

To study social behavior in nature, the investigators will use microchipped individuals of the well-studied food-storing bird species, the mountain chickadee, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-technology in feeders that can provide different resources to each individual bird. The researchers will test whether differences in winter environmental conditions at higher and lower elevations in the mountains are associated with differences in social organization and information sharing; whether variation in learning and memory used in finding stored food is associated with differences in social behavior; whether reliability of information that individual birds provide to other birds affects their social status and social organization; and how changes in social groups to affect social group structure and function. This project will provide training to a postdoctoral researcher and numerous graduate and undergraduate students, collaborating with the UNR Biology Undergraduate Research Program and the Center for Student Cultural Diversity to recruit students from under-represented groups. The investigators will also create scientific displays for the members of the public and students from local schools at the University of Nevada Reno Museum of Natural History and at the local field research station. <br/> <br/>The evolution of sociality has been a topic of major interest in biology for decades. Questions about the causes and functions of social group structure have recently received a resurgence with the rapid development of social network analyses. Major challenges in collecting social network data lie in the reliable detection of social contacts, especially in highly mobile, free-living animals. The use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has enabled automated detection of individual movements and contacts and allows a rather unprecedented avenue for investigating social behavior, notably by manipulating individual access to resources and hence the ability to experimentally re-structure who individuals interact with. This project will use comparative and experimental approaches to investigate structure, function and fitness consequences of social networks in environments that differ in winter climate severity in a highly social, resident, food-caching species that uses spatial cognition to find numerous food caches for overwinter survival, the mountain chickadee. Using a well-established field system in the Sierra Nevada mountains and RFID-based feeders this project will test whether (a) there are environment-related differences in social network structure and function; (b) variation in spatial cognitive ability is associated with differences in network position and function; (c) reliability of information and distribution of food resources affect social network structure and individual network positions; and (d) experimental, food-related reassignment of birds into different social groups are temporally stable and have fitness consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This method is based on advances in 'genome editing', a revolutionary technology that promises the ability to introduce genetic improvements or novel functionality to genomes where genetic resources are currently limited. Applications in plants that require replacing an endogenous piece of DNA with another DNA sequence are possible but are very inefficient due to very low rates of HR. The technology developed in this project is designed to overcome this bottleneck, with the aim to advance organismal biology by greatly facilitating the testing of gene function through direct modification of a broad range of genes of interest. Such advances will contribute to improvements in the understanding of the genomes-to-phenomes relationship. This could, for example, accelerate the development of plants with improved resistance to pathogens, or enhanced crop yields. The project will carry out experiments to further develop, test, validate and improve this technology and its application, first testing the components of the system, then applying what is learned to single and multiple targets. The work will test the system in cassava and foxtail millet, as well as in model flowering plants. Broader impacts of the project include the wide dissemination of the method for the improvement of crop plants and other species, plus the training of students via integration with long-running and successful undergraduate internship program. <br/><br/>The project will focus specifically on techniques to facilitate and accelerate the identification of successful products of HR by reporter-based methods using transcriptional activation. The approach combines insertion of a repair template (containing the desired genome edit and a selectable marker) with methods to rapidly find a desirable, rare HR event - the proverbial ""needle in a haystack"". Data from cassava demonstrates that this is an effective method for developing molecular and genomic tools for orphan crops and those lacking robust genomic resources. The work will be done in cassava, Arabidopsis, and Setaria as the primary species for analysis, because a demonstration in these species would support broad utility in eudicot and monocot species, including most crops. The questions to be addressed by this project include: 1) whether the efficiency of HR can be improved by focusing on selection of the products; 2) whether HR-based approaches be used to successfully tag non-coding RNAs such as microRNA and tasiRNA precursors; and, 3) whether it is possible to develop efficient processes for high-throughput, library-based knock-ins. The project will develop an approach for a key functional genomic tool (improved selection of products of HR) to enable direct tests of hypotheses about gene function in diverse organisms. Project members will be trained broadly in plant biology and genomics, gene function and functional genomics, and computational methods. All resources generated in this project will be made available for use. Specifically, constructs will be deposited in nonprofit global plasmid repositories and web-based tools will be designed to enable users unfamiliar with genome editing to successfully design custom components of SureFire for application to their organism(s) of study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electrical activity that nerve cells produce rely on a well-balanced flow of ions across the cell membrane. It is this balance that is critically altered by temperature, leading to failures in neural activity and accordingly severe consequences for vitality. Many animals have evolved compensatory mechanisms allowing their brains to function over a wider temperature range. This research elucidates such evolutionary conserved mechanisms with a novel approach by studying the same nerve cells in several different species of crustaceans. Crustaceans are ideal systems to address these issues because of their large and identified nerve cells and they live at a variety of temperatures. Recognizing evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for temperature compensation is not only crucial for understanding how animals survive in continuously changing environments, they are ultimately also a prerequisite for the investigation and treatment of hyper- and hypothermia. This project will provide comprehensive training in identifying temperature effects on nerve cell physiology and in cutting-edge electrophysiology for all levels of students. Results will be disseminated publicly through Youtube and a variety of public outreach programs. <br/><br/>Possessing compensatory mechanisms that maintain vital neuronal activity when temperature changes is critical for animal survival. Recent data from central pattern generators in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system have shown that descending projection neurons that provide extrinsic neuromodulation to motor networks can counterbalance detrimental temperature effects in these networks. Compensation is achieved by counterbalancing temperature-dependent increases of ionic conductances, allowing for a quick and flexible response to temperature influences. Descending projection neurons are universal building blocks in the motor circuits of many taxa, and the goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that temperature compensation via neuromodulation is a widespread phenomenon and evolutionarily conserved. Experiments will be carried out on several closely and distantly related crustaceans with various evolutionary backgrounds and temperature tolerances. Specifically, extra- and intracellular recordings, including voltage- and dynamic clamp, from identified modulatory and pattern generating neurons in the stomatogastric ganglion will (1) determine temperature compensation in related species with similar temperature tolerance and (2) determine temperature compensation in distantly related species with different temperature tolerance. This study will show that neuromodulation is more than a means to increase flexibility in the nervous system in that it stabilizes neuronal activity in a functional context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Receptors of the innate immune system that recognize such pathogens are important for starting the process of pathogen clearance, and are unchanged over an individual's lifetime. Moreover, several genes involved in innate immunity appear to be evolutionarily conserved across major animal groups. Researchers have little understanding of how innate mechanisms of immunity recognize and defend against the wide diversity of microbes and viruses encountered by different animals in different environments. To explore this question, as well as to more fully understand the genetic setting that led to the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, researchers will explore the diversity and conservation of innate immune mechanisms across deuterostome animals (a group that includes acorn worms, sea stars, sea cucumbers, sea squirts, and vertebrates). To undertake this work, researchers will employ novel genomic data, develop bioinformatic tools, and use an experimental approach to understand which innate immune genes are activated, or repressed, when various antigens are presented to the study animal. Acorn worms, relatives of chordates for which little is known, will be a main focus of experimental work. Additionally, investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students drawn form diverse backgrounds. Workshops focused on elementary and middle schools students will transfer knowledge and excitement about biodiversity, genomic tools, and immunology.<br/><br/>Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) pathways are part of an ancient innate immune defense system spanning Metazoa, and are known to react to conserved molecular motifs exhibited by common pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi). Pattern Recognition Receptor-facilitated defenses include pathways initiated by Toll-Like Receptors (TLR), RIG-I like Receptors, and NOD-like receptors. Unfortunately, the evolution of innate immune systems across invertebrates, including the ancestral state for deuterostomes, is unclear. Moreover, the breadth of TLR-facilitated ligand-specificity has been suggested to be fine-tuned to the niche an organism occupies, despite exhibiting evolutionary conservation across lineages and thus, evolutionary time. The functional novelty of Pattern Recognition Receptors, origins or associated pathways, and degree of evolutionary conservation are open questions. This study combines informatics and experimental tools to, 1) gain insight on the ancestral state of innate immunity in hemichordates, ambulacrarians, and ultimately deuterostomes, 2) further understand the setting of organismal pathogen-defense systems preceding the genesis of adaptive immunities, and 3) quantitatively assess variation and divergence of innate immunity elements over evolutionary time. Differential gene expression and in situ hybridization will be used in controlled settings to assess deployment and responsiveness of innate immunity pathways. Functional conservation will be assessed with experimental rescue of human TLR-/- cell lines with the corresponding hemichordate orthologs. The project will promote career development for a Beginning Investigator, graduate students, and undergraduates.  A set of outreach workshops (with immunology, genomic and evolution themes) is specifically proposed that will reach K5-8 and their parents.

The present project uses the brain's master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, as a model system to tackle this problem. In the brain clock, the way individual elements interact can be studied at multiple levels; for example, clock genes, clock neurons, the brain clock as a whole, or the behavior and physiology of the animal. The project aims to reveal new information about how individual neurons are connected in a network that produces a 24-hour rhythm in the brain clock, and how this master brain clock provides timing information to the rest of the body. It already is known that individual neurons, each with internal clocks of their own, are organized in time and space into distinct clusters bearing stable phase relationships to each other. Preliminary data indicate that the brain clock contains phase-coherent, and highly organized, ""rings"" of cells. This is exciting: it is the first demonstration of functional network topography within a hypothalamic nucleus. Classically, the hypothalamus is viewed as loosely organized collections of neurons. In other brain regions, such as the auditory or the visual cortex, neurons are organized in specific 3-dimensional spatial formations that are important for information coding. The goal of this study is to understand information coding in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and how the newly discovered rings contribute to the brain clock's network and function. In all the work, research in both the biological and mathematical aspects of the studies engages women undergraduate students interested in Neuroscience and in Applied Mathematics.<br/><br/>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the master clock in the brain.  The goal of this project is to gain insight into information coding in the SCN and to elucidate how ring-like arrangements among cells in the SCN contribute to the clock's network and function. The first study establishes the orientation of the rings by using coronal, sagittal, and horizontal slices of the SCN in vivo. The results contribute to the development of mathematical models that characterize coherent structures within the SCN. The second study involves use of tissue clearing methods to visualize the structures of the rings observed in SCN slices. The third study serves to test the function of the rings both in adults and during development and in animals with mutations that alter circadian rhythmicity. At each step, mathematical models of ring functions are being developed in parallel with the biological work, and used to develop ideas on how to further understanding of the ring structures. The results from these studies provide a new level of analysis to previously established aspects of SCN organization and extend the understanding of the widely-accepted core/shell structure of the SCN. A unifying hypothesis is that this multi-scale organization provides robustness and resilience to the circadian oscillatory system, a hypothesis tested here via modeling, simulation, and biological analyses of mutant and wild type SCN.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities that respond to specific pressures in the environment. However, many recent discoveries suggest that non-specific, general intelligence, similar to IQ in humans, also evolves. Most hypotheses about the evolution of intelligence suggest that general intelligence evolves as a side effect of selection for more specialized cognitive abilities. In contrast, the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis suggests that general intelligence is directly favored by natural selection when animals are coping with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals today, and present them with many new cognitive challenges. This work tests predictions of the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis by presenting wild spotted hyenas living in rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa with a battery of simple tests, much like IQ testing in humans. Performance on each specific task in the test battery will be compared among hyenas in the three habitat types, but a general intelligence measure will also be calculated from the individual test scores, and related to the strength of natural selection acting in each habitat. This work will permit determination of whether or not the strength of selection on general intelligence varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments.

Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals, presenting them with many new cognitive challenges.

For many species, the decision with whom to mate depends on information communicated via the release of 'pheromones', a complex blend of chemicals that are released by one animal to be sensed by another. Therefore, understanding how pheromones affect mating behaviors has broad implications for animal behavior and evolutionary biology. Because pheromones communicate precise information, the links between pheromone production and perception are expected to be relatively stable within species. However, previous studies suggest that pheromones are remarkably flexible, and can change rapidly as new species evolve. One possible explanation for this apparent puzzle is that some shared genes co-regulate the independent processes responsible for pheromone production and perception. These shared genes could provide a path for the evolution of pheromone signals without losing the link between pheromone production and perception. This hypothesis will be tested by taking advantage of the fruit fly courtship ritual as a model. Studies will focus on genes that encode proteins that function as pheromone receptors in the nervous system, as well as regulators of pheromone cuticular production, and their possible role in pheromonal differences between males and females and across related fruit fly species. In addition to training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, the broader impacts of this project will include genetics and neuroscience outreach and education activities associated with the public education system in the St. Louis region. <br/><br/><br/>Mating pheromones are essential for the maintenance of species boundaries in diverse animal taxa. However, it is puzzling how, as closely related species diversify, pheromones could evolve without fitness costs associated with their decoupling from related mate choice behaviors. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that mating pheromone production and perception are genetically linked via the action of pleiotropic genes. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis that members of the Gustatory receptor protein family in Drosophila play a role in the sensory perception of specific cuticular pheromones as well as in the regulation of their synthesis by acting as regulatory autoreceptors in the pheromone-producing oenocytes. Approaches will include a combination of behavioral, chemo-analytical, and state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9-dependent genome editing approaches to establish a genetic linkage between the perception and production of pheromones, to investigate the role of pleiotropic chemoreceptors in regulating the female pre-to-post-mating phenotypic switch from attractive to repulsive pheromonal profile, and the role of pheromone receptor evolution in promoting assortative mating and speciation in the genus Drosophila. Findings will provide novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of mating behaviors by pheromones in particular, and the evolution of mating signals in general. In addition to diverse genetics and neuroscience outreach activities in the St. Louis region, the investigator and co-workers will use studies of mating behaviors as training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students in experimental design, behavioral and genetic data collection and analyses, and scientific presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to understand how genes and developmental conditions together influence the brain, and how that alters social behaviors. The planned research takes advantage of extensive information on genetic and environmental influences on behavior of guppies, small fish that have evolved numerous behavioral responses to predators. Guppies that experience high and low levels of predation in the wild will be raised in laboratory conditions with and without predator exposure during development. Genetic and molecular experiments will link the patterns of gene expression in different brain regions to neural activity patterns and the resulting social behaviors. Results will demonstrate the extent to which similar behavioral traits (increased sociality in fish from high-predation sites and in fish exposed to predators) rely on the same gene expression changes and brain activity patterns, or whether similar behaviors may emerge from a variety of neural mechanisms. These findings will also reveal how sensitivity to environmental conditions shapes evolution of behavior. Developing this novel experimental approach will provide a model for other researchers seeking to understand the impacts of gene expression differences on behavior. The PIs will incorporate this research into undergraduate courses and will train graduate students via annual workshops on analysis of gene expression data. The simplicity and availability of guppies also make them amenable to enriching K-12 curricula in evolution and behavior, through development of a guppy module for for the Understanding Evolution resources for teaching evolution (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/).

Insects dominate fresh-water ecosystems in terms of animal biodiversity and ecological processes. Temperature controls insect growth, developmental timing, survival, and reproduction, which influence both the distributions of individual species and the specific set of species that occur in different freshwater ecosystems. Thus, many effects of global change and other anthropogenic activities on freshwater ecosystems will likely be manifested through their thermal effects on aquatic insects. The thermal limits of individual freshwater insect taxa and the underlying physiological mechanisms that determine those limits still remain poorly understood.  This research has practical importance because resource agencies use aquatic insects and other invertebrates to make inferences about ecological health and water quality.  However, these data are often difficult to interpret, because we have a poor understanding of how and why species are differentially responsive to elevated temperatures. This collaborative project links researchers with a broad range of expertise to understand how temperature affects organismal physiology, life-history outcomes, and ultimately the distribution of species across entire landscapes. <br/><br/>The research team will experimentally manipulate thermal regimes to quantify the effects of temperature on life-history outcomes (survival, growth rates, development times, size and fecundity) of a diversity of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) species. Laboratory experiments will identify how the specific physiological processes that affect life-history outcomes (respiration, energy allocation, the production of metabolites, and gene expression) respond to different temperatures. These laboratory studies will be used to refine ecological niche models (empirically derived relationships between environmental temperatures and species distributions in time and space) that are used in freshwater biodiversity assessment and monitoring.  In particular, these studies will clarify which descriptors of environmental temperatures (e.g. mean annual temperature, mean summer temperature, the magnitude of diel thermal change, etc.) are most important to species performance. Ultimately, these studies are intended to provide a robust understanding of the linkages between thermal physiology, life-history variation, and species distributions.

In humans, it is often considered a less important sense than vision or hearing, and this may explain in part why research has lagged behind that of other senses. Nevertheless, scent detection is a fundamental sense in animals involved in food acquisition, spatial orientation and mating. The wide variation of the sense of smell in animals (from marine mammals with very limited abilities to keen-scented species such as dogs) is affected by anatomical differences and likely has a genetic basis, yet the mechanistic connections between anatomy, genetic variation, gene expression and scent detection are poorly understood. This project uses dogs as a model system to investigate the anatomy and genetics of scent detection. Many dog breeds, such as scent hounds, have been strongly selected for an enhanced sense of smell, whereas other breeds, such as sight hounds, have been selected for visual acuity and are likely to have diminished ability to smell. Other canines, such as short-faced breeds, have impaired breathing and airflow across the nasal passage, which likely affects their sense of smell. Consequently, domestic dogs present a unique long-term experiment in scent detection and provide a range of sensory variation not found within any other mammal species. The results will uncover the mechanisms that enhance or lessen the sense of smell in animals and may allow for predictions of sensory function in a specific ecological context. Further, the results may lead to new biomedical insights for human health and impairments in the sense of smell. <br/><br/>In this project, the full sequence of the canine olfactory repertoire, which includes 1178 olfactory receptor genes, coupled with an analysis of gene expression will be undertaken in about 400 dogs from 26 breeds of varying olfactory ability.

This genetic information will complement anatomical and functional analyses of 66 dogs from the same breeds using high-resolution CT scans that will facilitate reconstruction of the olfactory organ, which will be analyzed and correlated with indices of olfactory sensitivity and olfactory gene repertoire diversity. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of airflow and odorant deposition in anatomically accurate reconstructions of the nasal cavity will be compared across these breeds to determine if the nasal anatomy and architecture of some dogs directs more odorant-laden airflow to the olfactory region of the nose. Anatomical, genomic and expression data will be available on the program website or submitted to public databases (e.g. DigiMorph or Genbank)."

Recent technical advances allow us to ask exactly which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences underlie evolutionary innovations in gene expression, neural function, and complex behaviors. The ability of an organism to form a bond with another individual is a complex behavior, one that shapes the social behaviors exhibited by many species, including humans. In the current project, the investigators identify evolutionary adaptations that underlie social bonding in a well-studied species, the monogamous prairie vole. The investigators compare the subtle changes in DNA sequences that distinguish monogamous prairie voles from promiscuous relatives. They also ask whether these changes in DNA influence gene function in brain regions important for pair-bonding as well as brain regions important for spatial memory because space use is a major factor in animal mating systems. Lastly, the investigators ask whether natural selection has operated on these DNA sequences by examining patterns of DNA variation. The findings will help understand how changes in complex behavior can emerge from variation in DNA. To complete the studies, the investigators will recruit and train undergraduates from under-represented groups. Further, the investigators will develop and disseminate research tools needed to perform similar studies on a great variety of species, making it easier to do cutting-edge studies of genome function and behavior in any species. The answers obtained from this work will elucidate the relation between behavior and subtle genetic variations that contribute to diversity and disease.<br/><br/>How is an existing genotype sculpted, locus by locus, to result in a new phenotype? The investigators use the genus Microtus as a model for understanding the epigenetic innovations that gave rise to social monogamy, building on an extensive body of work in social neuroscience, molecular genetics, and behavioral ecology. They examine the epigenome and its evolution in three vole species: the monogamous prairie vole, M. ochrogaster; the promiscuous meadow vole, M. pennsylvanicus; and a promiscuous outgroup, the California vole, M. californicus. Although many brain regions merit study, the investigators focus on four brain regions: reward structures (nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum) and spatial memory structures (hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex). In the first aim, they use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to identify species differences in gene regulation. In second aim, they use phylogenetic and population genetic methods to identify adaptations within the epigenome. The intersection of these two data sets will identify regulatory regions likely to be causally involved in pair-bond formation, and in mating system differences in spatial cognition. Finally, the investigators test whether the evolution of monogamy in this group relied predominantly on changes related to bonding, to cognition, or both. The identified DNA sequences can then be subject to manipulation in future studies."

This arrangement of neurons is thought to provide better integration and more sophisticated processing of information, but a thorough understanding of how complex CNSs arose in different animal groups and how these CNSs compare with one another is lacking. This project addresses these questions by examining CNS development in a very understudied group of animals, the annelid worms. Annelids are important for studies of neural development because they have CNSs with thousands of neurons that easily regenerate, unlike other animal CNSs that either do not regenerate well (e.g. humans) or do not have many neurons in their CNS.  This project will provide a better understanding of how a complex CNS can form and will develop several techniques as resources for the scientific community, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in the annelid Capitella teleta. This project also will support and train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. Finally, the findings and techniques developed in this project will be used to 1) augment undergraduate projects in a developmental biology course, 2) improve current outreach efforts with the Girls, Inc. Eureka summer program to engage local junior-high girls in STEM activities, and 3) develop, implement, and asses a new teaching module for local high school students and teachers that is designed to promote an appreciation of CNS diversity and a better understanding of how animal diversity arose.<br/><br/>A key question concerning animal evolution is how CNSs evolved and contributed to organismal diversity. In many animals with a CNS, a whole region of the ectoderm acquires the potential to become neural as part of dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis specification. In vertebrates and insects, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays an important role in both processes. This raises the question of whether or not the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and protostomes had a CNS and whether neural induction was linked to D-V axis specification in this animal. To test these hypotheses, data is needed from additional taxa, especially spiralians, one of two main protostome groups. This project will test these hypotheses by investigating the role of BMP signaling in D-V axis and CNS fate specification in the spiralian annelid Capitella teleta. Project aims are: 1) Determine the degree of conservation of BMP pathway components in C. teleta by characterizing their expression dynamics using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, 2) Assess the ancestral role of BMP signaling through gain- and loss-of-function experiments in C. teleta utilizing BMP protein and dorsomorphin, and 3) Assess the ancestral role of the BMP antagonist Chordin by analyzing function in C. teleta through CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and morpholino knockdown. By studying the function of BMP signaling during development of a spiralian annelid, this work will significantly contribute to our understanding of CNS evolution and the involvement of the BMP signaling network in D-V axis specification and CNS formation in the ancestral bilaterian."

This project aims to understand how jawed vertebrates evolved from jawless fish.  This will be done by comparing the development of the modern jawless fish, lamprey, with that of two jawed vertebrates, the african clawed frog, and the zebrafish.  To do this, modern methods for manipulating gene function will be used to alter the activity of genes involved in head skeleton development.  These manipulations are aimed at partially recapitulating the evolutionary process and pinpointing which genes were most important for jaw evolution. The work will shed light on a major evolutionary event that made possible the evolution of the majority of vertebrates now living on the planet, including humans.  The project will also help elucidate how the head skeleton and jaw develops in all vertebrates and contribute to efforts to understand the developmental and genetic basis of diseases effecting the face, skull, and jaw. Additionally, the project will provide training in modern genome engineering methods for a postdoctoral scholar, two graduate students, and several undergraduate and high school students. It will also support the maintenance of a traveling museum exhibit about animal development and evolution, and accompanying public lectures by the lead investigator.<br/><br/>The morphology of early vertebrate fossils, and basally-diverging modern vertebrates, suggests that jaw evolution involved two major changes in head skeleton structure; the evolution of morphologically distinct dorsal and ventral skeletal elements, and the positioning of flexible joint tissue between these elements.  How, mechanistically, these changes occurred, is unclear.  In gnathostomes, head skeleton precursors are segregated early in development into dorsal, ventral, and intermediate domains by interactions between Jagged-Notch, BMP, and Endothelin (Edn) signaling pathways.  These signals regulate the combinatorial expression of Dlx, Msx, and Hand transcription factors which, in turn, activate the morphogenetic and differentiation programs that shape skeletal elements and specify joints.  To better understand the developmental changes underlying gnathostome head skeleton evolution, this research will utilize the living agnathan, lamprey.  Lamprey is the only extant jawless vertebrate amenable to routine embryonic manipulations. Initial gene expression studies suggested that lamprey lacks dorso-ventral restricted expression of Dlx paralogs in head skeleton precursors. Subsequent work revealed unexpectedly gnathostome-like expression of Edn signaling components, Dlx, Msx, and Hand in the forming lamprey head. Furthermore, it was found that a lamprey homolog of the joint tissue specifier, Gdf5, is expressed in mucocartilage, a soft, mesenchymal skeletal tissue histologically similar to gnathostome joint tissue.  These data supported a model in which; 1) a sophisticated gnathostome-type head skeleton patterning system predates the evolution of jaws and 2) the evolution of joints was driven by the repositioning of ancient gene programs for soft skeletal tissue differentiation within this conserved pre-pattern. The proposed work will take advantage of recent optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in lamprey to test key predictions of this model in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, and the frog Xenopus laevis."

In these models, hibernators periodically rewarm to active levels between bouts of depressed metabolism. In this research, a unique model of hibernation will be used. Common tenrecs (Tenrec ecaudatus) originate from Madagascar and in contrast to all other known hibernators, do not periodically arouse from hibernation.  Moreover, these mammals have a very variable active body temperature, which allows for direct comparison between active and hibernating tenrecs at the same body temperatures. This research will determine the extent and duration of metabolic savings associated with hibernation.  In addition, studies will determine how kidney function, protein synthesis, and protein degradation are affected by body temperature and hibernation status in tenrecs. It is anticipated that this research will not only reveal the underlying mechanisms for this novel form of hibernation, but provide insight into the evolution of hibernation. Students will receive research training throughout the course of this project and outreach efforts will include development of a television program on hibernation. <br/><br/>Tenrecs may be the closest extant representative to the early placental mammal ancestor. Surprisingly little is known of the physiology of tenrecs and even less is known about their unusual mode of hibernation. The common tenrec, Tenrec ecaudatus, normally experiences wide fluctuations in body temperature and we found these animals experience a novel form of hibernation wherein animals are consistently lethargic throughout the Austral winter. Even when handled or held at warm temperatures, tenrecs do not arouse to the extent seen in other small hibernators such as ground squirrels. The investigators will combine respirometry measurements with telemetric measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, and tissue oxygenation, to understand the energetics of metabolic suppression. Since vital homeostatic processes such as renal function and protein metabolism are essentially restricted to the interbout arousal in rodents like ground squirrels, the lack of an interbout arousal in the tenrecs begs the question of the status of these processes. They will determine how tenrec glomerular filtration and renal blood flow are affected by body temperature and hibernation. In addition, the status of transcription, translation, and protein degradation during hibernation in tenrecs will be monitored. These data will serve as an important mechanistic foundation for understanding hibernation in tenrecs and, importantly, will serve as a platform for understanding the function and perhaps evolution of the interbout arousal- a feature common to all other known small mammal hibernators."

The research will focus on understanding the effects of emerald ash borer on white ash populations that exhibit variations in physiology as a result of being adapted to different environments from which they originated. This variation may be key for understanding tree decline and potential resistance in response to emerald ash borer.

This irritation is referred to as acridity. Acridity has been reported in Kiwi fruit, a number of palms and ornamental plants (such as Dieffenbachia, daffodils, hyacinths and other bulb plants) and pose health risks to harvesters, children and pets. All the edible Aroids, including taro or dasheen, are acrid to varying degrees. Aroids such as taro's nutritious corm are eaten as a staple and the leaves as a vegetable by more than half a billion people. The cause of acridity is unknown.  The current assay for acridity is to eat a small sample or rub a raw corm on the forearm of a test subject. More often than not, the test leads to the rapid withdrawal of test subjects from the study. The goals of this project are to determine the cause of acridity in taro so that potentially rapid breeding selection tool(s) can be developed to test for acridity.  A viable solution to the acidity bottleneck would contribute to better food availability and new value-added products.   <br/><br/>This project is at the exploratory stage and could transform the molecular understanding of acridity, an anti-nutritional property of taro and other aroids. The common belief is that acridity is caused by sharp barbed needle-like calcium oxalate crystals (raphides). However, the fact that purified acrid raphides can be inactivated by proteinase with no change in raphide morphology suggests that proteins on the raphides cause acridity in an allergy type reaction. At least twenty-eight proteins are found on purified raphides. The goal of this project is to identify and validate which of these raphide-associated proteins are responsible for acridity in taro. Once identified, the protein(s) will be sequenced and predicted allergy-causing sequences will be further identified by sequencing. The sequences will then be used to develop a molecular assay for validating and associating the presence of the proteins with differences in acridity between taro varieties from Africa, Asian and Oceania. This project will be the first in-depth study to solving this major breeding bottleneck to improve the quality of taro, a traditional but neglected crop, and increase crop diversity and thereby increase the market opportunities' for small-farmers and rural households. Acridity data will be integrated into the European Union's Innovation & Networks Executive Agency (INEA) funded project on taro.  Advanced training in biotechnology will be given and technology shared and coordinated with existing projects."

This award supports a two year EAGER project that focuses on the unexplored epigenetic inheritance of modified phenotypes of a higher-order physiological process, cardiovascular performance, and how physiological variation might result from mechanistic variation. Among key novel aspects of the proposed experiments is the focus on ""true"" transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in non-placental animals, rather than in utero or maternal effects. This project will focus on inter- and intra-individual variation in the underlying molecular mechanisms.  The significant Broader Impacts of this proposal include the cross-training of a cohort of both US students and Mexican graduate students (involving UNT's new agreement with Mexico's CONACyT funding agency). These students will receive training in the nexus of physiology and epigenetics as well as an enriched perspective on international research coordination.<br/><br/>Three hypotheses will be tested in the course of this project: H1: The Transgenerational Epigenetic Effect. Exposure to aquatic hypoxia in mature adult zebrafish (P0) before they begin reproduction will modify cardiovascular phenotype in their offspring (F1 and possibly F2 and beyond); H2: Epigenetic Dynamics. Epigenetically-inherited cardiovascular phenotypes are highly dynamic, showing both variation between individuals and slowly disappearing (fading out) across generations; and H3: Epigenetic Mechanisms. The germ-line of the P0 generation experiences variable degrees of DNA methylation and/or histone modification that lingers through subsequent fertilization and development, which may be correlated with variably altered gene expression and hence variation in the modified physiological phenotypes in the F1 generation. Data from this study are likely to underscore an emerging yet still vaguely defined rationale for why epigenetic inheritance has been selected for as a mechanism for surviving environmental changes that span several generations.

Characterizing the genetic and physiological basis of local climatic adaptation is especially critical for assessing whether and how plant species, including crops, can persist through periods of environmental change.  Using the widely-adapted species white clover, this project examines the factors that allow this plant to thrive in climates as dramatically different as northern Minnesota and central Florida.  The production of cyanide-containing compounds appears to play a role in this process, particularly for adaptation to heat and drought.  These compounds are also found in several important crop species, and their importance for drought adaptation will be examined in detail for the first time.  Other aspects of natural genetic and physiological variation in climate tolerance will be assessed through field experiments.  The project will provide classroom materials and curricular activities for an ongoing and highly successful inquiry-based educational outreach program developed by the principle investigator, which has already engaged more than 8000 students and 100 teachers nationwide. Students sample and analyze their local clover populations and contribute data to an online database, where they can compare observations with classes from other climates.  Scientific training will be provided to undergraduates, including those from minority backgrounds, as well as two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>Adaptation to local environments plays a key role in the ability of plant species to survive and persist through environmental change, yet the genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie this process are largely unknown. Through work that integrates QTL mapping of fitness traits, candidate gene analyses of two well-characterized biochemical polymorphisms, and physiological assessments of their fitness impacts, the following questions are addressed, using white clover (Trifolium repens) as a study system: 1) What is the genetic architecture of local climatic adaptation?  Specifically, to what extent does it arise through fitness tradeoffs for alternate alleles of individual genes (antagonistic pleiotropy), or through combinations of loci where individual genes provide a fitness benefit in one environment and are selectively neutral in others (conditional neutrality)? 2) What are the physiological mechanisms by which cyanogenic glycosides function in abiotic stress adaptation? 3) What is the role of gene copy number variation (CNVs) in local adaptation?  This work will rigorously test the function of cyanogenic glycosides, which are found in >3,000 plant species including many crops, in abiotic stress adaptation.  CNVs are abundant in the genomes of many taxa, and the project will directly assess their role in local climatic adaptation, which has not previously been done. The project will also engage high school students and teachers nationwide in hands-on, inquiry-based learning through an ongoing and highly successful outreach program based on clover cyanogenesis, and it will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates."

Many insects have an extreme version of plasticity called polyphenism, in which they exhibit new body parts in response to environmental stressors such as a lack of food or increased population density. These alternative morphologies are often controlled by juvenile hormone (JH). Despite acting across the entire organism, only certain tissues respond to changes in JH. This project will elucidate the genetic basis of JH sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster and use this as a model for the developmental control of polyphenisms in other insects.  This project will be implemented as a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for third year students at Baruch College, CUNY, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution in New York City. The major impact of this project is increased undergraduate participation in research, particularly students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Course-based research projects increase the opportunity for students at institutions with small numbers of available individual mentorships.  By offering research projects as part of a course, they are made available to students who may not be aware of either the opportunities on campus or the benefits of participation, may not otherwise be chosen for an individual mentorship, and may not have the financial independence to take time away from paying jobs to participate in research. This project will result in an increase in Baruch College graduates joining the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The expected significance of the proposed project is three-fold: First, the range of natural variation in hormone sensitivity across tissues will be determined by measuring the degree of sensitivity in all of the genotyped flies in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). This will bolster understanding of developmental plasticity within a single species. Second, the genetic architecture of hormone sensitivity within a population will be determined by performing a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on the variation data. This will elucidate the genomic distribution of genes involved in hormonal response. Lastly, new genetic targets of the JH pathway will be discovered, greatly increasing the number of known functional targets in this critical pathway. This discovery will provide a hierarchy of JH targets from the hormone receptor level to the downstream effector genes, significantly advancing the field of JH biology. These target genes will then be used to study JH at different developmental time points and across hexapods."

In addition to sharing their results with other scientists, the researchers will train K-12 teachers at the world-class education program at Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research site (CDR), and develop teaching modules about disease for students in grades 7-16. The researchers will also partner with CDR's NSF ESTEEM project to involve Native American students in ecology research. The project will promote interaction between biologists and mathematicians, and between researchers who study disease and insect behavior. <br/><br/>The interaction between movement and disease is increasingly recognized as an emerging frontier for both the fields of movement ecology and the ecology of infectious diseases. For pathogens transmitted by insects, insect vector movement is a key component of the infection process. Yet, in most ecological disease models, vector behavior is highly simplified. A deeper understanding of the role of vector movement and foraging behavior in mediating population-level infectious disease risk is an important frontier spanning population, disease, and behavioral ecology. The approach proposed here couples a novel modeling approach with a tractable experimental system and promotes understanding of vector-host-pathogen interactions in three parts. First, the modeling approach enables the incorporation of context-dependent decision making in vector movement and will generate expected trends for vectored pathogens in animal and plant systems, broadly. Second, the proposed experimental work will use a globally relevant phytovirus-aphid system that permits experiments that are near impossible in other (plant and animal) vectored disease systems. Finally, existing field data will be used to test model predictions about the importance of vector behavior for infection in response to environmental change under field conditions. By generating predictions from a behavioral modeling framework and an experimentally-tractable empirical system, the proposed theory-experiment pairing promises novel insights into the likely role of vector behavior in the dynamics of a wide array of vectored diseases."

For centuries, biomechanics research has provided a foundation for developing and testing hypotheses ranging from general governing principles of terrestrial locomotion to specific relationships between form and function of limbs and muscles. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in laboratories on treadmills and tracks that bear little resemblance to the environments in which animals actually live. To truly understand the relationship between an animal's muscular and skeletal anatomy and locomotor performance, it is necessary to understand the mechanical demands of the tasks performed in the animal's natural environment. Understanding these relationships in natural habitats remains an important challenge. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the relationships between anatomy and locomotor performance through a series of experiments aimed at understanding in detail how different muscles contribute to movement tasks. Experiments will reveal how specific features of muscles and skeletons impact the function of particular muscles during locomotion in mechanically challenging natural environments. The outcomes of this research will advance knowledge about the functional roles of individual muscles, a topic that is rare in comparative biomechanics studies, and lay the groundwork for a better understanding of how mechanical energy is transferred through complex musculoskeletal systems. Application of this knowledge can lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other human locomotor enhancement devices.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to elucidate the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and bipedal hopping dynamics in desert environments using desert kangaroo rats (D. deserti) as an animal model. It is generally believed that bipedal hopping has evolved because it provides a locomotor performance advantage (e.g., faster top speed, higher endurance, acceleration capacity) related to exaggerated hind limb morphology; however a specific advantage has not been identified for all hopping species. To achieve the proposed objectives, this study will incorporate analyses of habitat use in the field, gait dynamics in the lab, in-vivo muscle dynamics and detailed computer modeling and simulations. This will be the first study to combine all of these methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and performance. This powerful, integrated approach will be used to pursue two specific research objectives: 1) Quantify the mechanical demands of bipedal hopping on substrates and terrain utilized by D. deserti in their natural environment and, 2) Elucidate the relationship between musculoskeletal morphology and habitat use. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish direct links between locomotor performance under natural conditions and musculoskeletal morphology and muscle function in a way that has not been previously possible. An enhanced understanding of how and why animals hop will advance the fields of evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, and biomechanics, and lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other locomotor enhancement devices. This proposal supports an Educational Plan to develop a field course to provide an opportunity for students to integrate what they have learned about ecology and evolution through research-driven, field-based analyses of habitat use, functional morphology, and behavior. Data for behavior and habitat use from multiple years of this course will provide a broader context for interpreting morphological and biomechanical results."

However, a major hurdle has been that the vast majority of studies are correlative.  Tools allowing researchers to pinpoint causal associations between genes and traits are limited. This research will apply the latest technology to study gene function in an emerging model for organismal biology, Polistes wasps. These insects, commonly known as paper wasps, are well-studied, cosmopolitan, social insects.  Because of their abundance in human environments, ease of experimental manipulation, and rapidly developing genomic resources, they are poised to address many integrative organismal biology questions (including speciation, behavior, development, and neuroscience). The project will employ two cutting edge technologies for gene manipulation along with focused efforts to breed and maintain colonies in the laboratory, in order to test causality for several genes associated with traits such as coloration, learning, aggression, and development. This work can have a catalytic impact on a growing community of researchers interested in using social insects to address a wide variety of questions in organismal biology, applied entomology and agriculture. Training and mentoring in the latest methodologies will be provided to one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, one research technician, and numerous undergraduates.  Results, resources and methods will be disseminated widely to the research community through symposia, lab exchanges, and workshops.<br/><br/>This project will develop resources for functional genomics in Polistes fuscatus wasps using a three-pronged approach. First, the researchers will use RNA-interference (RNAi) for ecologically relevant tests of candidate gene function. Functional genomic tests can be performed in the wild, allowing for assessment of gene function in an ecologically relevant context.  The project will improve RNAi efficiency through experimenting with technical parameters and biological conditions and test candidate genes for roles in phenotypes such as caste development and cognition. Second, the researchers will establish methods for controlled mating in the laboratory, and continuous rearing, aiming to contract the colony cycle, induce nest founding, and induce egg laying to provide continuous availability of insects for research. These developments will establish Polistes as a tractable model for rearing stable lines for functional genomics. Third, using gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9, the team will produce first generation (G0) wasps by injecting embryos and targeting the pigmentation gene yellow, with the goal of producing transgenic mosaics with non-lethal but readily observable phenotypic effects. Successful mutant G0s will be used to produce stable transgenic lines in the lab for yellow and then move on to other target genes of interest. This work may transform Polistes wasps into a functional genomic model system for numerous areas of organismal biology. The work is also unique in that it will allow for tests of gene function under controlled conditions in the laboratory as well as in the field, providing the major advantage of addressing how gene function depends on environmental context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is accomplished using largely the same gene families found in all animals, thus understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these impressive feats of regeneration will shed light on why this does not occur in humans; such basic biology research could ultimately lead to improved regenerative medicine therapies. A major barrier to the success of such research is the relative lack of tools to manipulate gene function in highly regenerative animals. Regeneration research would benefit from a model organism with the following attributes: 1) adult stem cells differentiate frequently and enable complete tissue regeneration; 2) cells can be tracked as they differentiate and migrate; and 3) tools for studying gene function with spatial and temporal resolution. Currently, no model organism has all three of these attributes; however, Hydra vulgaris is a promising candidate. Hydra has remarkable regenerative abilities, and its simple tissue organization and optical clarity enables cell tracking using optical microscopy. However, the community currently lacks tools to precisely manipulate gene expression. Therefore, this project aims to develop these tools, which will ultimately be used to understand the molecular basis of regeneration.<br/><br/>Hydra stem cells indefinitely support adult homeostasis and can direct regeneration of the entire adult body from a small piece of tissue, including rebuilding the nervous system from a single stem cell. This project aims to establish fast and precise control of gene perturbations in Hydra, thus enabling studies of genotype-phenotype relationships during development and regeneration. Although transgenesis in Hydra is established, four bottlenecks hamper functional genomics: 1) Establishing transgenic lines is slow, 2) The lack of cell-type specific promoters, 3) The lack of temporal control over gene perturbations and 4) It is cumbersome to maintain large number of different transgenic Hydra strains. The following approaches will be implemented to overcome these bottlenecks: 1) To accelerate the establishment of transgenic lines, Tol2 transposase will be used to increase the frequency of transgenesis events during embryogenesis. 2) To gain spatial control over gene perturbation experiments, specific promoters will be identified and tested for all cell types by leveraging single cell RNA sequencing data. 3) To gain spatial control over gene perturbation, an inducible gene expression system will be developed that will also work with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. This system will work for all Hydra cell types, but this proposal will focus on perturbing gene function in neurons. 4) A Hydra vivarium for automated Hydra care will be developed and implemented for high throughput maintenance of transgenic lines. The success of these goals will enable effective genotype-to-phenotype testing in Hydra and thus enable regenerative biology research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This symposium will bring together a diverse group of biologists that study the evolution of morphology and its function. In particular, the speakers will discuss the study of behaviors that require coordination of many structures (e.g., feeding and locomotion) and organisms that use the same structures across multiple behaviors. This multi-component coordination (referred to as integration) is common in organisms but, due to limitations in data acquisition and analytical tools, is typically not addressed.  This symposium will foster improved understanding of how integration influences the ecology and evolution of organisms by promoting discussion among speakers who are at the forefront of addressing hypotheses of integration, leveraging new tools in evolutionary statistics and biomechanical analysis. The speakers are diverse in terms of research topic, career stage, gender, ethnicity, and type of institution. Each speaker will publish an article in Integrative and Comparative Biology to provide a resource for future researchers interested in these ideas. This issue will also highlight complimentary presentations submitted by students and early career researchers. Open dialogue among participants, including a panel discussion, has been built into the program, and student social media representatives will convey ideas and questions to those who are unable to attend the symposium, including the public. <br/><br/>As increasing use of genomic tools informs scientists about genetic control of phenotype, understanding of patterns and processes driving evolution of complex phenotypes, such as those inherent in many biomechanical systems, lags behind. Functional morphologists and organismal biologists strive to understand how organisms persist and flourish in a given environment. However, the parts of an organism often interact in complex ways to affect function, survival, and evolution. For example, some structural elements can be redundant relative to function, organisms may use such elements differently across contexts, or organisms may use the same anatomical element to perform multiple functions. These interactions are typically considered constraints on the ability to adapt and evolve, but they may also facilitate evolution if they allow multiple parts to change simultaneously in a way that favors survival. These emergent properties of form-function relationships should be of considerable interest to comparative biologists, but the field has been constrained by the broad scope of these questions that require potentially complex methodologies. This symposium aims to reconcile and unify this integrative organismal perspective, provide inspiration for new methodological approaches, and generate new hypotheses that can stimulate future studies of structural and functional complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Occasionally, insect populations explode throughout broad geographic ranges, and then collapse back into their smaller permanent breeding zones within months or years. Neither the mechanisms of population expansions nor declines are well understood, but our knowledge of the declines is particularly poor. This is a major challenge in organismal biology and ecology, with significant implications for human society. This research project will take advantage of an ongoing outbreak of the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata) to test the hypothesis that the ability for S. cancellata to attain a balance of nutrients optimal for growth limits their capacity to maintain persistent high populations over broad regions of South America. Locusts are a major challenge for food security globally, with outbreaks causing 80-100% crop losses. In the future, working collaboratively with government plant protection agencies, this research can be directly applied to strategies to improve livelihoods, human and environmental health, and global food security. Moreover, this award will support postdoctoral and student training, and cross-cultural exchange. <br/><br/><br/>The South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata) is experiencing its largest population upsurge in 60 years, expanding beyond its permanent breeding zone in northwest Argentina into a much larger part of Argentina and beyond into Bolivia and Paraguay, causing national emergencies in those three countries. One hypothesis for why S. cancellata do not persist at high densities in their invasion zone, which is supported by preliminary data, is that S. cancellata in their expansion zones are unable to obtain food of sufficiently high carbohydrate:protein ratio to maximize their fitness. This poor nutrition then leads to population decreases in their expansion zone. This carbohydrate insufficiency hypothesis will be tested in this project by: 1) assessing the plant macronutrient contents and feeding behavior of S. cancellata in the field at sites differing in median plant macronutrient ratios; 2) measuring the short-term effects of dietary macronutrient content on the performance of juvenile S. cancellata in the field, and 3) measuring the whole-lifetime effects of dietary macronutient content on the performance of S. cancellata in the lab under controlled environmental conditions. Together these experiments will test the mechanisms potentially responsible for fluctuations in locust populations in the recession and invasion zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These communities often metabolize compounds that their host species cannot, and likely supply essential compounds needed for homeostasis and reproduction, particularly for organisms that experience seasonal diet stress or protein limitation. This project will combine studies of amino acids using stable isotope techniques coupled with next generation genetic sequencing to (1) identify and potentially quantify, the degree to which the gut microbiome contributes to protein budgets and the building and maintenance of tissues by its hosts, and (2) characterize which microbial taxa are most closely associated with digestive metabolisms in the gut, in which amino acids are used subsequently by the host to synthesize tissues. These topics will be addressed through a series of controlled feeding experiments on deer mice where the proportion and isotopic compositions of dietary macromolecules and individual compounds will be systematically varied.

In young organisms, nervous systems are highly plastic; neural cells can change their shape and their function. Older nervous systems tend to be less flexible, and large-scale reorganizations are unusual. This research examines adult plasticity in neural circuits responsible for hearing in crickets, which can regrow and rewire auditory neural connections after damage. This plasticity produces functional recovery of hearing loss that is variable among individual crickets. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that govern this type of plasticity, and to explain the variability in functional recovery among individuals. Because these same or similar mechanisms exist in a wide variety of organisms, what is learned from these cricket experiments will be generally applicable to circuits in other organisms. The broader scientific impact of the work will be its contribution to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of adult nervous system plasticity and how this knowledge can be used to promote functional recovery after nervous system trauma. This work will also have important educational impacts both at Bowdoin College and within Maine. Undergraduates will be active participants in the proposed scientific research, and a special effort will be made to identify, support, and retain students from underrepresented groups. In addition, the PI and her students will participate in annual STEM outreach activities at local elementary schools and with Wabanaki middle school students, widening the societal impact of the funding.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph:<br/><br/>A persistent question about nervous systems is how plastic they remain as they mature.  This research project focuses on one of the rare examples of large-scale anatomical plasticity seen in adulthood. The adult auditory system of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus demonstrates profound structural plasticity after the loss of an ear, consisting of large-scale growth and branching of dendrites and axons. These changes result in wavelength-specific physiological recovery that compensates for the loss of the ear; the extent of recovery in different crickets is highly variable. The PI and her students will test the hypothesis that the extent of anatomical sprouting correlates with recovery, as seen in the strength of physiological responses to auditory stimuli and to behavioral indications of auditory system recovery.  The extent of recovery within individual animals will be assessed by testing negative phonotaxis, electrophysiological responses of auditory neurons to sound, and quantifying dendritic and axonal changes in auditory neurons. Bayesian statistical modeling will be used to analyze the data across these levels. Experiments will test whether it is possible to manipulate form and function by altering semaphorin signaling. DsRNA will be used to manipulate sema and plex levels, and any resulting changes in morphology, physiology and behavioral function will be assessed. Given the evolutionary conservation of neuronal strategies for development and plasticity, what is learned from these experiments using G. bimaculatus will be applicable to deafferented circuits in a wide variety of other organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will reveal whether the same or different genetic changes are associated with limb loss among these different lizard groups. This research will combine technologies from different fields of biology in novel ways to explore this extraordinary example of repeated evolution and gain new insight into genome function. This project will greatly improve knowledge of the genes and genetic control elements involved in limb development. Additionally, in the course of this project, thousands of genetic regions that are shared by humans and other animals will be characterized. Therefore, project data will deliver insights that can be applied to better understand other functional elements within the genomes of humans and different animals. The methods developed will pave the way for other researchers who wish to leverage the power of natural evolutionary experiments to understand genome function.

For instance, egg-tending behaviors can reduce growth of pathogens on eggshells and thereby reduce egg mortality. However, many egg-layers lack parental care and instead leave eggs unattended and exposed to environmental pathogens. The PIs are interested in how such animals prevent egg loss in the absence of parental care, and propose a novel source of protection, protective microbes that passively transfer from the reproductive system of the mother to eggshell surfaces during egg-laying. A collaborative team centering on behavioral ecology and microbiology will examine maternal and eggshell microbiome and their interactions with soil pathogens utilizing lizards as a model system to test the hypothesis that the microbiome affects reproductive success, signaling, and behavioral interactions of lizards. The PIs will mentor undergraduate and high school students in research, especially women and STEM underrepresented minorities. They will provide high-quality interdisciplinary training to the next generation of scientists by involving students in all aspects of their research and by translating their work into class-based projects.  The proposed research has the potential to shed light on the role of the microbiome on animal behavior.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The interdisciplinary research group will investigate the novel hypothesis that vertically-transmitted cloacal microbes function in egg protection. Preliminary data from Sceloporus virgatus (a phrynosomatid lizard with no parental care) suggest that mature eggs have more bacteria, less fungal growth, and higher hatch success when oviposited than when surgically removed without cloacal contact. The team will: 1) quantify temporal variation in cloacal microbiomes of S. virgatus to test whether females? microbiota change in preparation for egg-laying; 2) use both experiments and observational study to characterize vertical transmission and the role of transmitted microbes in reducing egg infections; 3) relate cloacal microbiota to female reproductive success and signals/cues of reproductive value; and 4) conduct comparative studies across Sceloporus spp. to examine the relationship of reproductive mode (oviparous vs. viviparous) and infection risk on antifungal capacity of cloacal microbiota. Vertical transmission during oviposition is expected to be a general phenomenon, so results should be broadly applicable to other oviparous taxa. The proposed work includes training in sequencing and bioinformatics for the PI, who is based at an undergraduate-serving institution. These methods will be implemented, along with culture-based techniques, in vitro analyses, and field study, in collaboration with carefully mentored undergraduate and high school students. The research will be foundational to the integration of microbiology and behavioral ecology, contributing to long-standing theoretical questions about costs and benefits of parental care (or lack thereof) and sexual signaling, expanding knowledge of microbial diversity and composition in an understudied host lineage, and potentially identifying new antifungal agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Obligate fungal pathogens, i.e., pathogens that require their host to survive, are a major threat to crop production worldwide.  Effector proteins secreted by these pathogens suppress host defenses to promote nutrient acquisition and colonization. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these effectors manipulate these processes are poorly understood. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by identifying the networks of interacting host and pathogen proteins in the well-characterized barley-powdery mildew, host-microbe system. Previous joint NSF-BBSRC funded research identified a collection of novel effectors secreted by the powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, that contribute to pathogen virulence. This group of effectors will be used to identify host target proteins, using yeast two-hybrid screens, with the goal of identifying proteins that are targeted by multiple effectors.  These host targets, as well as key effectors, will be evaluated for their roles in host immunity by silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) and by overexpression in a bacterial type III delivery system. Those that impact host immune regulation will be further characterized using TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) mutagenesis or RNAi-mediated gene silencing in stable barley transgenics. Among the fungal effectors identified and characterized thus far is a predicted metalloprotease (BEC1019) that is required for virulence, suppresses host defenses and is evolutionarily conserved among at least 96 other diverse fungi, including economically important plant pathogens, animal pathogens, and free-living non-pathogens.  As a proof of concept, barley will be engineered with a newly discovered system that will activate defense responses upon detection of BEC1019 activity, which is predicted to confer resistance to a wide range of fungal pathogens.<br/><br/>Deciphering the molecular functions of evolutionarily conserved fungal effectors and understanding the host genes that respond will elucidate plant defense mechanisms and promote broadly applicable disease control strategies. All research objectives will be incorporated into training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and K-12 teachers. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project, ""Functional characterization and validation of nonhost components in Triticeae species for durable resistance against fungal diseases (DURESTrit)"", will enhance the training of students and postdocs. An inquiry-based Research Experience for Teachers on ""Inheritance of Traits and Genes in Barley"" (iTAG Barley) will be disseminated to serve underrepresented groups in secondary schools, community colleges, and 1890 land-grant institutions, providing hands-on training in genetics as it applies to agriculture and human health.

This function is performed in animals by epithelial tissues, which form or synthesize barriers that are essential for structural integrity, defense against infection, and internal homeostasis. In insects and other invertebrates, epithelia perform their barrier function in part by synthesizing extracellular structures such as the cuticle, eggshell, and peritrophic matrix: durable, cross-linked matrices composed of protein, chitin, lipid, and other small molecules. This award will support research into a novel genetic pathway that is critical to the formation of epithelial barriers in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The specific conservation of drd among insects strongly suggests that the results of the planned studies will be of broad interest to insect biologists and could be relevant in controlling insect-borne disease and developing novel insect control strategies.<br/><br/>The gene drop-dead (drd) encodes an integral membrane protein and has traditionally been considered a neurodegeneration gene, due to the short adult lifespan and profound neurodegeneration displayed by drd mutant flies. However, data indicate a defect in the development of multiple epithelial barrier structures in drd mutants. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that drd is required for the formation or stabilization of extracellular epithelial barrier structures. The proposed experiments will use histologic, genetic, and biochemical approaches to characterize the pathways by which the drd gene product regulates barrier formation.  Because insect barrier synthesis is not well understood and because drd was not previously recognized as essential to this process, these experiments will break new ground in our understanding of basic epithelial biology.    The award will support training for 9 undergraduates, including at least three members of underrepresented minority (URM) groups recruited in collaboration with the Educational Opportunity Program at Marquette University.

VHSv emerged only recently in the Great Lakes, and little is known about how it arrived and why it periodically leads to large scale fish die-offs. The proposed project will examine how VHSv's evolution in the Great Lake region has contributed to its ability to cause disease, and should aid informed predictions about future outbreaks. Thus, the investigations will integrate studies on VHSv evolution with identification of the means by which the virus disrupts immune systems of infected fish, leading to sickness or death. These results should help to identify how specific genetic changes in the virus can lead to either enhanced or reduced impact on infected fish, and thus will provide critical data for understanding the connection between viral genetic changes (i.e., viral evolution) and the host's response. Results will contribute towards more effective prevention, prediction, and control of VHSv, aiding national and international management efforts. Although the work will focus on the spread of VHSv within the Great Lakes region, the studies will have application to other viruses (fish and otherwise). The PIs will design an attractive mobile display for museum exhibits and broader distribution at conferences and public meetings to assist in disseminating the information beyond the scientific community, and will train both graduate and undergraduate students as part of this project.<br/><br/>Each of the aims of the project addresses a specific question about the spread of this disease in the Great Lakes region. Evolutionary diversification patterns and rates of VHSv genes will be evaluated using each protein gene (nv, N, M, L, and P)  in strains and substrains, using new and existing samples. Results will determine how these are related to viral selection in new outbreak taxa and areas, and whether and how strains become endemic or epidemic. Cellular and host responses will be assessed to determine how mutations within viral genes that repress fish innate immune responses affect function by comparing VHSv M and P (and other) gene functions among VHSv strains.

Preliminary data suggest that glia, cells thought to provide nutritive support for neurons, undergo a new, potentially fundamental form of plasticity: diurnal and light-stimulated morphological dynamics in the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This concept is novel and has not been effectively explored. Knowledge of the patterns and regulators of SCN glial plasticity over the daily cycle will contribute significant new insights on glial cellular dynamics in the brain, an emergent property of an understudied area. Goals of educational and outreach components are to develop and validate effective cross-disciplinary instructional modules involving neuroscience, imaging, and three-dimensional analytic techniques. Emphasis will be on engaging women and groups underrepresented in neuroscience research. Outcomes will include a series of educational materials, presentations, and publications for use with K-12 educators and students and the general public aimed at increasing interest and awareness of recent research findings. This will enhance scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The scientific issues will be addressed using confocal microscopy coupled with computer-based analysis of glial structural complexity and spatial organization in the rat SCN. This study will advance understanding of diurnal modulation of glial plasticity in two ways: 1) providing an unbiased, high-resolution three-dimensional assessment of diurnal patterns of SCN glial plasticity, and 2) generating new insights on signals that alter glial structure and thereby dynamic cell-cell relationships. Assessment of efficacy of the educational and outreach components will be made in partnership with Prof. Lizanne DeStefano, Director of the Illinois STEM Education Initiative and an expert in design and evaluation of innovative STEM education programs.

The studies will test how NGF, and the proteins that it interacts with, promote or inhibit neuron survival and stimulate or eliminate neuron connections during the development of the circuits that characterize the SNS. The involvement of these proteins in these developmental processes is an emerging and important area of neuroscience. Microfluidic devices and novel microscope software will be developed to automatically acquire and analyze the data.  All software and microfluidic devices that are developed during the project will be freely available to the scientific community.  The research will involve ten undergraduates and ten high school students over the five-year duration of the award.  Additionally, the researcher will hold seminars on ""thinking scientifically"" for 15-20 students per year at a local high school.

These experiments will also determine whether pro-destruction receptors require one another for cell death, branch elimination, and synapse restriction both in vitro and in vivo. If these receptors depend on one another for a particular destructive event, their physical interaction will be examined as well as whether NGF signaling influences the dynamics of this interaction as a means of inhibitory signaling. By assigning particular TNFR family members to particular destructive events and understanding how NGF suppresses each of these receptors, we are poised to gain fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning development of the SNS."

Cells in animal nervous systems are no exception; they need to constantly change their signaling connections with other cells (synapses) in brain circuits in response to both normal environmental changes and to physiological challenges such as toxins, so that brain function can be homeostatically maintained within a physiologically appropriate range. However, we currently have a very poor understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of cell-to-cell communication that affects brain circuitry. This project uses genetic tools uniquely available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster together with electrical recordings, biochemical techniques, synapse imaging by microscopy, and drug manipulations to understand how a newly-identified molecular factor in fruitfly muscles (called Heartless/Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase [Htl/FGFR]) homeostatically controls the level of activity in the motor nerve cells that cause these same muscles to contract. This research will precisely elucidate what causes this muscle-specific molecule to become biologically active, and how it signals its activity backwards in this circuit to affect the activity of the nerve cells that control muscles. This research plan also integrates a variety of educational activities at multiple levels, including: 1) an ongoing research and educational collaboration with a faculty member at a nearby primarily undergraduate institution (PUI); 2) a yearly three-day summer workshop designed by the principal investigator (PI) to expand neuroscience research resources for PUIs; 3) K-12 STEM public outreach in Iowa through tours of the PI's lab and school visits by the PI and his graduate students; and 4) long- and short-term research opportunities for undergraduates, including underrepresented minority students enrolled in programs such as the SROP/McNair Scholars Program at the University of Iowa.<br/><br/>Homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity direct synapses and circuits to maintain normal ranges of output, despite the perturbations they may experience throughout life. A significant unknown is the molecular underpinning of the homeostatic regulation of synapse function. The PI's lab addresses this problem utilizing the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. At the NMJ, impaired muscle excitability is corrected by offsetting, homeostatic increases in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Precisely how the muscle communicates a need for increased neurotransmitter release is not understood. Similar forms of regulation have been found in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems, and they are not understood either. Using Drosophila genetics and electrophysiology, the PI's lab has identified new molecules that illuminate signaling events controlling synaptic homeostasis. One molecule forms the basis for this project, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase. Data from the lab support muscle-specific roles for FGFR. The central hypothesis is that muscle-derived FGFR activity tunes synaptic strength by mediating both anterograde (nerve-to-muscle) and retrograde (muscle-to-nerve) cell-cell signals. There are two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular signals in the muscle triggered by FGFR during the execution of homeostatic compensation. This aim includes experiments that will identify direct targets, as well as the retrograde signal(s) activated by those targets. Aim 2 will determine how homeostatic FGFR signaling is activated and regulated. Both aims will employ a combination of electrophysiology, biochemistry, synapse imaging, and pharmacology."

Most mammals enter the world in a fairly dramatic fashion. A vaginal birth is accompanied by marked hormonal changes, mechanical stimuli associated with labor and delivery, and a transition from the sterile environment of the womb to one teeming with microorganisms. The fetus makes many physiological adjustments to survive outside the womb, and labor and delivery are the most reliable predictors of the upcoming challenges. This project examines the effect of birth on brain development, using mice as a model species. The investigators will look at effects of the timing of birth (within the normal range) and mode of birth (vaginal versus cesarean birth) on measures such as cell death and brain inflammation. Birth triggers major developmental switches for the lungs, heart, and other peripheral organs, and may play a similar role in brain development. If so, results from this project could fundamentally change the way we think about the role of birth in neural development.  Both principal investigators are unusually active in education and outreach at the local, national, and international levels, and the project will involve undergraduates and graduate students. The home institution is ranked first in the nation among not-for-profit institutions in awarding bachelor's degrees to African-American and disadvantaged students, and the investigators' laboratories reflect this diversity.<br/><br/>The team of investigators will test the idea that birth alters brain development by varying the timing or mode of birth and examining effects on the patterning of neuronal cell death, and colonization of the brain by microglia. About 50% of the neurons that are initially produced are eliminated by apoptosis. The investigators recently found that cell death peaks just after birth in most forebrain regions of mice. In Aim 1, the investigators will vary the timing of parturition to test whether the association of birth with cell death is causal. Parturition also abruptly activates the peripheral immune system. The investigators hypothesize that this immune activation extends to the brain and will test that here. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are in an activated state perinatally, and increase in number soon after birth, but whether birth causes changes in microglia is unknown. The peripheral immune activation after delivery also varies by mode of birth: vaginal birth is associated with a greater increase of many immune markers compared to cesarean delivery. Interestingly, the investigators' preliminary data show that mode of birth affects cell death in several brain regions. Thus, to identify aspects of ""birth"" that influence brain development, Aim 2 will contrast effects of vaginal and cesarean delivery on cell death and neuroimmune activation. In Aim 3, the investigators will interfere with immune activation to determine whether effects of birth on microglia and cell death occur in parallel or are related (i.e., microglia may promote cell death)."

Flies are fed a chemical that causes mutations in the DNA, the progeny are bred and then examined for altered development of the fly. A mutation that breaks an essential gene will cause dramatic changes in the body pattern. Many of the fly genes identified this way have human counterparts, which perform very similar functions during human development. The Bejsovec laboratory uses this strategy to study the inner workings of a genetic pathway that is shared between flies and humans. This pathway, triggered by the Wg/Wnt growth factor, tells cells where they are in the body and what special structure to become; inappropriate re-activation of the Wnt pathway in adult tissues is associated with human cancers. The Bejsovec lab has found that three genes already known to work together to control cell division, have a second unexpected function in controlling the Wnt pathway. This project will determine how these genes exert control over the pathway, and how their action disrupts the fly body plan. Broader impacts of the project include deeper understanding of developmental mechanisms in all animal species, and a hands-on research experience for undergraduate and high school students in the Bejsovec laboratory and for undergraduates in an existing laboratory course.<br/><br/>     Although the Wg/Wnt pathway plays a central role in development and tissue homeostasis, the sequence of events, from Wg/Wnt binding at the cell surface to the downstream activation of target genes, is still not completely understood. Tumbleweed (Tum), Pavarotti (Pav) and Pebble (Pbl) repress Wg/Wnt pathway activity in cultured human cells and in fly embryos. These genes may represent a crucial missing link, perhaps missed in earlier screens for Wg/Wnt pathway components because all three genes have essential functions in cell division. In cytokinesis, Tum and Pav position Pbl-RhoGEF at the equator to activate the G protein, Rho, which organizes the actin contractile ring. Work proposed here will determine whether (and how) Tum, Pav, and Pbl make contact with known Wg/Wnt components, and will test whether GTPase activation is involved. In addition, reducing Tum or Pbl function in adult precursor cells creates a novel homeotic transformation which may result from the simultaneous disruption of cell signaling and cell division. Genetic and molecular tools available in Drosophila will be used to determine how misregulation of signaling and/or cytokinesis might alter segmental identity. The resulting data will provide insight into Wg/Wnt pathway control and tissue patterning, and may reveal new connections between cell division and cell fate specification during development. The unique appearance of the transformed flies will appeal to undergraduate and high school students, engaging them in the scientific enterprise and helping to recruit a diverse group, including women, socioeconomically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students, into the workforce."

Within the xylem of flowering plants, water is transported through multi-celled hollow tubes called vessels.  Most vessels are quite short and water must move from one vessel to another, through microscopic pits in the walls of vessels, to travel long distances within a plant.  The many interconnected xylem vessels within the vascular tissue combine to form the xylem vessel network.  Although knowledge of xylem vessel structure and function is important in understanding plant water use and water transport, the structure of vessel networks remains little studied.  This study will examine xylem vessel network structural traits as they relate to the xylem's ability to efficiently and safely transport water.  The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that vessel structure determines xylem hydraulic function; however, the focus of the research will be on three specific structural traits that have been little studied: vessel length, connectivity, and network pit area.  Importantly, all three of these traits represent xylem structural features at the tissue level and all are features of the three-dimensional xylem vessel network.  This represents an important step beyond traditional xylem structure-function studies that often rely on two-dimensional cross-sectional analyses.  The information generated by completion of the proposed study will provide integral knowledge of the links between plant hydraulic structure and function, and, specifically, the influence of vessel network structure on hydraulic function in woody plants.  <br/><br/>The project will integrate research on xylem structure and function with community outreach and educational programs designed to involve students from diverse backgrounds and scholastic levels in the scientific process.

The greater ani is a tropical bird that nests in groups: several females lay their eggs in a shared nest and help to raise the mixed clutch of nestlings. However, some females act as reproductive parasites, laying their eggs into a group's nest but providing no parental care. A female ani can therefore use two alternative tactics for reproduction: she can nest in a cooperative group and help to raise her own young, or she can act as a parasite and let another group do all of the work. But why do some females nest cooperatively, whereas others, in the same population, act as parasites? One goal of this project is to understand whether this behavior difference is due to underlying genetic differences, or whether it results from differences in the females' histories (for example, their body condition or the nutrition that they received during development). A related goal is to understand how a female's reproductive behaviors affect her male mate. Are males more successful if they pair with a parasitic female, or a cooperative female? Conversely, does a male's behavior affect whether his mate acts as a parasite or a cooperator? This research can provide significant insight into why reproductive behavioral variation occurs and how males and females coordinate behavior for maximal reproductive success. Field work for this project will take place in Panama, creating opportunities for formative research experiences for low-income high school and college students in the U.S. Finally, it will enable participation in a New Jersey state prison teaching program that serves one of the most neglected and under-served populations in the country.<br/><br/><br/>Individual variation in behavioral strategies poses an enduring evolutionary puzzle. When should selection favor divergent solutions to the same problem, instead of a single optimum? Disruptive selection, in which intermediate behavioral phenotypes have lower fitness than extreme alternatives, is thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in male animals. However, the evolutionary dynamics and proximate mechanisms influencing female ARTs remain poorly understood, although such strategies are widespread. The greater ani (Crotophaga major), a tropical bird that nests in social groups, provides a unique opportunity to answer fundamental questions about the evolution of female ARTs. Females typically lay their eggs in communal nests and share reproduction and parental care; however, a small minority of females consistently act as reproductive parasites, laying their eggs into the nest of a host group but providing no parental care. The co-existence of widespread parasitism and non-kin cooperation offers an ideal system in which to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolutionary origins and maintenance of female ARTs. The goals of this project are to 1) evaluate whether disruptive selection on reproductive investment favors discrete parasitic and communal tactics; 2) investigate the environmental and genetic mechanisms determining the expression of these strategies; and 3) understand evolutionary feedbacks between alternative female strategies and male fitness. Data on individual reproductive behaviors will be collected from a long-term field site in Panama, enabling direct estimates of heritability, reproductive output, and reproductive investment from a color-marked population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, multiple chytrid species are causing global declines in amphibian population, including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that is devastating frog populations, and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) that is thought to be poised to do the same to North American salamanders. Despite the importance of chytrid fungi in global ecosystems, basic modern biological tools have not yet been developed for any species of chytrid fungus. This lack of molecular genetic methods makes it impossible to directly test hypotheses about how and why chytrids cause disease. This project will develop and test the first molecular genetic tools for chytrids and will foster the use of these tools by different scientific communities. The project will broadly impact many scientific communities, via wide dissemination of the tools using rapid and open data and protocol sharing, as well as direct training of scientists from diverse laboratories. <br/><br/>This project seeks to overcome the main bottleneck to modern genetics in the zoosporic chytrid fungi: molecular transformation. Although chytrids occupy key ecological, evolutionary, and pathogenic niches, the current lack of basic molecular tools is a major impediment to hypothesis-driven research. The project will overcome this deficiency by developing methods for genetic transformation for one species from each of the two main lineages of chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an important pathogen belonging to the Chytridiomycota, and Allomyces macrogynus (Am), a system used to study alternation of generations and a member of the Blastocladiomycota.

Many of these organisms are adapted to life in Earth's oceans, where much of carbon flux takes place at very low nutrient concentrations. Some microbes that grow at these low nutrient concentrations' oligotrophs - do not regulate biochemical pathways for nutrient assimilation involving carbon oxidation. In contrast, among the more commonly studied copiotrophs - cells that grow rapidly at high nutrient concentrations - regulation of nutrient assimilation is ubiquitous. An example of a cell that has reduced regulation is Pelagibacter, the most abundant organism in the oceans. At present there exists no explanation for the lack of regulatory systems for nutrient uptake in cells that live in low nutrient ecosystems. In this study, a combination of laboratory experiments, mathematical modeling and genome analysis will be used to examine hypotheses about the costs and benefits of regulating nutrient assimilation. Studying the costs and benefits of different strategies for nutrient assimilation in microbes will aid in the prediction of behavior of nutrient cycles and will lead to a better understanding of aquatic ecosystems. This research may also help scientists understand why so many common microbial cell types have been challenging to grow and study in scientific laboratories. The educational component of this project will involve training a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar. A workshop on carbon cycling by microorganisms will be presented to teachers and high school students.  <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will test the hypotheses that nutrient uptake systems may evolve to be unregulated due to (A) cost/benefit of regulation at different frequencies and magnitudes of nutrient pulses, (B) molecular biological constraints that prevent effective operation of a regulatory system at very low nutrient levels (excessive stochastic noise in the regulatory system), or (C) synergy with chemotaxis, which is typically not done by oligotrophs, so they experience nutrient patches at lower concentrations and for shorter times, or some combination of these mechanisms. A model will be developed to explicitly resolve the assimilation systems and their regulation at the gene level, accounting for the dynamics and metabolic costs of protein synthesis and function (Hypothesis A). An agent-based (aka individual-based) modeling approach will be used to explicitly resolve population heterogeneity (Hypothesis B) and individual transport by chemotaxis and diffusion (Hypothesis C). The investigators will also perform nutrient upshift experiments with a number of oligotrophs, copiotrophs and nutrients, to characterize the response times and induction concentration thresholds by measuring transcript abundance and uptake of radiolabeled nutrients. A subset of experiments will additionally include measurements of nutrient and cell concentrations, proteins and metabolites, nutrient uptake and oxidation rates, and growth rates. The data obtained from these experiments model will be used to calibrate and fine tune the model. The synergy between regulation and uptake (Hypothesis C) will also be tested by comparing genomes of oligotrophs and copiotrophs. A postdoctoral scholar and graduate student will be involved in the research and outreach will be performed to high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, they do this using very simple, fracture resistant materials. The research will combine high-speed videography, biomechanics, and mathematics to characterize and model power-amplification in a diverse group of trap-jaw ants. The findings will provide insight into the mechanisms animals use to achieve extremely high speeds and forces with their limbs and to determine how variation in these high-performance biological systems generates diverse animal forms. The research also has the potential to inform biologically-inspired applications for robotics and machinery. The project will provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will also run robotics summer camps for children, exposing students to the many ways insects can be used to provide inspiration for innovations in technology and engineering.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to examine the mechanical sensitivity and integration of power-amplified systems using a combination of experimental data and computer-based biomechanical models. The results of these mechanical analyses will be incorporated into phylogenetic comparative analyses to test whether patterns of mechanical sensitivity influence morphological and ecological diversification. Specifically, the research will take advantage of repeated transitions to power amplification in trap-jaw ants to explore how performance metrics (such as speed, force and energy) respond to shifts in morphology. The power-amplified trap-jaw system is composed of multiple components (i.e. muscle, latch, spring) all of which may be important to several aspects of performance (i.e. speed, force). The specific aims of the project are to 1) evaluate how various performance variables of the trap-jaw system (speed, force, damage resistance) vary with morphological changes in components of the system,  2) test multiple hypotheses for the source of the power-amplifying mechanism in trap-jaw ants, and 3) determine how patterns of biomechanical integration influence evolutionary patterns within and among trap-jaw clades. The interdisciplinary research approach offers a mechanistic framework for evaluating the integration and evolution of biomechanical systems, and how ecological function can influence morphological diversification. The research findings have the potential to provide translational applications for the bio-inspired design of high-performance robotic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some symbioses, each partner improves the well-being of the other partner. For example, some bacteria that reside in the human gut provide a benefit to humans through vitamin production, keeping out harmful bacteria, or fortifying the immune system. In turn, humans provide gut bacteria with a place to live and food. Animal-bacterial symbioses are fascinating not only because they are widespread and seem to play critical roles in human biology, but also because these relationships generate tremendous complexity at the molecular level. Each partner must recognize, and then continue to tolerate, a specific associate. How is this delicate balancing act of specificity and tolerance achieved? This award will study the mechanism of this symbiotic balancing act in a model symbiosis, between a nematode (roundworm) and bacteria. To better understand specificity in this symbiosis, researchers will use microscopy and genetics to identify relevant molecules and mechanisms. To better understand tolerance in this system, they will define genes that generate an appropriate response to the partner. Overall, by studying mechanisms that govern specificity and tolerance in a specific symbiosis, the work will generate testable hypotheses for how animal/bacterial relationships are regulated more generally. Finally, because the award funds research at an undergraduate-only institution, it will positively impact many young scientists. They will learn experimental techniques, data analysis and strategies for communicating their results to the public via an online writing program. <br/><br/>This award studies partner specificity and tolerance mechanisms in the model symbiosis between Heterorhabditis nematodes and Photorhabdus bacteria. Together, these partners infect and kill insect larvae; the nematode serves as a delivery vector while the bacteria produce insecticides and antibiotics. The symbiosis is very specific. Not every Photorhabdus strain can colonize every Heterorhabditis strain. It is also a remarkable example of tolerance. Photorhabdus is a powerful pathogen, capable of killing not only insects but also multiple genera of nematodes while sparing its Heterorhabditis host. At different stages of the nematode life cycle, the bacterial symbiont either stably colonizes, or is digested by, the nematode. The award will determine how specificity and tolerance of the Hetorhabditis/Photorhabdus symbiosis are achieved at a molecular level. Specifically, it will test the hypothesis that genetically encoded regulatory mechanisms, in both symbiont and host, shape the symbiosis at two levels: (1) over evolutionary time - determining which specific relationships endure; (2) over a single host's lifespan - maintaining tolerance without compromising self-defense. The proposed research will identify specificity and tolerance mechanisms in both host and symbiont, using microscopy, forward genetics, gene expression analysis, and nematode lifespan/fitness assays. Projected outcomes include enhanced understanding of regulatory mechanisms in this system and expanded knowledge of nematode-bacterial interactions in general. Furthermore, this work has the potential to improve understanding of how symbiotic/antagonistic relationships evolve and persist. The awards enhances scientific education at an undergraduate institution and promotes both research and scientific communication skills of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, only a small percentage of introduced plants actually become problems, and one of the biggest challenges in invasive species management is to identify whether some species are 'pre-adapted' to invade - that is, have attributes in their home range that may identify them as potential threats before they are introduced. This project compares the performance of over 40 species of invasive plants in their home and invaded ranges across fields and forests in the Northeast U.S. and in similar climates of Europe and Asia. Combined with laboratory tests of leaf chemistry and structure, the investigators will determine whether invasive plants change in their invaded range in ways that make them better able to compete with native vegetation, or whether they already possessed these competitive attributes in their home range. The combination of field and laboratory measurements across a large range of species in multiple habitats will provide a unique set of data to identify the main constraints on leaf function. The project fosters international knowledge transfer and research partnerships through exchanges of senior personnel, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates between research labs. Results will contribute to land management practices through a better understanding of mechanisms behind successful invasions of non-native plants. The project enhances STEM education by increasing resource development and outreach activities for the ""Syracuse Global Change Garden"", an education-based arboretum on the Syracuse campus.<br/><br/>This project addresses the mechanism of ecological advantage of invasive plant species from two complementary angles. First, researchers will determine how plants of different photosynthetic capacity allocate a key limiting resource (nitrogen) to different leaf functions (light harvesting, carbon fixation, cell wall structure, defensive compounds) to test whether nitrogen allocation drives assimilation rate, and whether invaders have higher allocation to assimilation than co-occurring native species. Second, researchers will determine whether invasive species have altered their allocation to assimilation rate in their invaded range in response to reduced natural enemies, or whether photosynthetic advantages were already present in their native range due to different regional evolutionary histories. Finally, the investigators will test experimentally whether photosynthetic performance is the principal driver of competitive dominance in invaders. This project will be among the first to test invasion and leaf allocation theory empirically across a large number of species and habitats (forest and field environments), and to test the 'pre-adaptation' theory of species invasions at a physiological level. The project will also advance our understanding of invasion processes by determining whether shifts in leaf function commonly occur in the invaded range, and whether such processes are sufficient to alter interactions with native species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The invasive, bloom-forming alga Prymnesium parvum (aka, golden algae) has spread to more than 20 states in the last two decades, causing massive fish kills and threatening many inland recreational and commercial fisheries. While a good deal is known about the chemical nature and effects of golden algal toxins, less is understood with respect to why these toxins are produced, the mechanisms by which they are produced, or the means by which they are delivered to targeted organisms, such as fish. Researchers have long thought that golden algal toxins are produced during times of stress (as with a lack of sufficient nutrients) and released into the surrounding water to kill potential competitors and prey, thus freeing previously unavailable nutrients and alleviating the stress. In truth, however, this hypothesis is poorly supported by theoretical considerations and experimental data. This research challenges this long-standing paradigm of algal toxicity and, with the novel combination of experimentation with genetic, genomic, and analytical chemical approaches, aims to explicitly characterize how these toxins are produced and regulated, and how golden algae expose other organisms to these toxins. Expected results could transform the current toxicity paradigm and lead to significant future advances in the understanding of harmful algal blooms within the context of minimizing human and wildlife health risks associated with exposure to algal toxins.<br/><br/> Broadcast allelopathy, the prevailing paradigm in protistan toxicity, lacks convincing theoretical or experimental support. The objective of this NSF-supported research is to provide clear and meaningful analysis of toxin production and delivery in the toxigenic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum. The experimental approach is twofold, involving 1) novel analytical detection of toxins during predator-prey interactions, and 2) a genome-guided genetic foundation for toxigenesis and heterotrophic nutrient acquisition. The central hypothesis is that toxigenic protists use direct cell-to-cell contact for delivery of toxins and subsequent uptake and transport of prey cell constituents across the cell membrane. The underlying rationale of this research is the recent experimental demonstration that toxicity of P. parvum is mediated by direct prey contact, as well as the theoretical consideration that delivery of exotoxins by diffusion is unlikely, and not advantageous to the fitness of individual P. parvum cells. This research is significant because it will elucidate a fundamental process through which predation and heterotrophy are supported in toxigenic protists, and will thereby potentially transform the current toxicity paradigm by definitively identifying a mechanism for toxin delivery that would provide a fitness advantage without the need for group selection arguments. Results of this study will lead to future work focused on the mechanisms of protistan cell-cell interactions, physiological and biochemical action of protistan toxins, reassessment of the role of toxicity in bloom formation, and a model for exploring other toxigenic protistan taxa and the multitude of harmful algal toxins in aquatic systems."

Guppies that experience high and low levels of predation in the wild will be raised in laboratory conditions with and without predator exposure during development. Genetic and molecular experiments will link the patterns of gene expression in different brain regions to neural activity patterns and the resulting social behaviors. Results will demonstrate the extent to which similar behavioral traits (increased sociality in fish from high-predation sites and in fish exposed to predators) rely on the same gene expression changes and brain activity patterns, or whether similar behaviors may emerge from a variety of neural mechanisms. These findings will also reveal how sensitivity to environmental conditions shapes evolution of behavior. Developing this novel experimental approach will provide a model for other researchers seeking to understand the impacts of gene expression differences on behavior. The PIs will incorporate this research into undergraduate courses and will train graduate students via annual workshops on analysis of gene expression data. The simplicity and availability of guppies also make them amenable to enriching K-12 curricula in evolution and behavior, through development of a guppy module for for the Understanding Evolution resources for teaching evolution (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/).

Studying these changes is crucial for understanding the unique adaptations developed by organisms to survive the test of time. One molecule whose change over time can influence evolution is a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH activates reproduction to ensure the propagation of all vertebrate species. In invertebrates, GnRH is assumed to also activate reproduction although consistent support for such an assumption is lacking. It is hypothesized that invertebrate GnRH is not universally important to reproductive activation in invertebrates. Instead, invertebrate GnRH may assume a wide range of functions in neural, motor, and metamorphic control. The project investigates non-reproductive function of GnRH and a related peptide in an invertebrate animal, the sea slug Aplysia californica. These studies may reveal non-reproductive roles of GnRH critical to the survival of invertebrate species.<br/> <br/>To study the non-reproductive function of GnRH and the related peptide, adipokinetic hormone, a combination of whole organism studies and molecular and biochemical techniques will be used.  The investigators will address the following aims: 1) Examine the role of GnRH in metamorphic development, 2) Perform in vitro functional analysis of GnRH receptor isoforms, investigate their distribution, and 3) Investigate the function of adipokinetic hormone. The work challenges a vertebrate-centric notion that invertebrate hormones essentially function as their vertebrate counterparts. This conceptual shift is important for advancing our knowledge on how changes in hormone function contribute to the survival, adaptation, and evolution of metazoans. For broader impacts, this project will provide Dr. Tsai with opportunities for: (1) undergraduate training, (2) minority recruitment, (3) inter-departmental and trans-Pacific collaborations, (4) information dissemination via the development of a novel website that uses humor and cartoons to engage K-12 students in comparative reproduction, and (5) outreach activities to showcase sea slugs to middle school students.

The evolutionary radiation of Anolis lizards in the Caribbean has become a textbook case study of adaptive radiation, demonstrating that independent radiations can converge on very similar adaptive traits. This project expands this work to ask why in some cases evolutionary diversification yields very different results. On each island in the Greater Antilles, evolutionary radiation has occurred, producing species specialized to use different parts of the habitat (e.g., twigs, grass, canopy). Amazingly, evolution has occurred independently on each island, producing the same set of habitat specialists.  Detailed analysis has indicated that strong relationships exist among species between anatomy and habitat use.  Long-legged species occur on broad surfaces, for example, and more arboreal species have better developed toepads.  Functional studies have explained these relationships by determining the relationship between morphology and functional performance capabilities, on one hand, and between performance abilities and habitat use and behavior, on the other. Anolis has also radiated widely in mainland Central and South America.  Although less studied, these lizards have clearly evolved in different ways. Mainland anoles are as diverse among themselves as are island anoles, but the mainland species differ anatomically from the islands species. Most strikingly, the relationship between anatomy and habitat use differs fundamentally between mainland and island anoles.<br/><br/>The PIs will investigate whether differences in the anatomy~ecology relationship result because the relationship between functional capabilities and ecology differ or because the relationship between anatomy and functional capabilities differs (or both). In addition, the PIs will seek explanations for the variation in anatomy~performance relationships between island and mainland lizards, focusing on the physiological properties of muscles. Jointly the data collected to address these goals will enable the PIs to address the question of why mainland anoles have radiated in fundamentally different ways than island anoles.

In addition, the balanced intake of essential nutrients or metabolites is important for human nutrition worldwide, but their content is often sub-optimal in crop species, as is the case for the essential amino acid methionine in legume seeds. In higher plants, carbon and nitrogen are quantitatively the most important nutrients for plant development. The macronutrients are taken up by the plant and are assimilated into sucrose and amino acids. These are then transported in the vascular system to the seeds to support growth and accumulation of storage reserves such as proteins, starch, or oils. The goal of this project is to understand and manipulate carbon and nitrogen assimilate transport to legume seeds, and to overcome potential bottlenecks of assimilate movement. This study will provide clues as to how transporter proteins function in delivery of carbon and nitrogen nutrients to seeds, and on their critical role in seed yield and nutritional quality.<br/><br/>Technical Description of the Project:<br/>Transgenic modifications of amino acid and sucrose transporters have underlined their essential roles in assimilate partitioning; however, there has been only limited success integrating transporter function with seed development, seed metabolism, and the synthesis of seed storage compounds and their nutritional quality. Current data suggest that a bottleneck within the long distance transport pathway lies in the transporter activity, or the lack of it, in both leaves (i.e. phloem) and embryos. Furthermore, research supports strong regulatory control by nitrogen assimilate transporters over metabolic processes up and downstream of their function. In this study, Pisum sativum L. (pea) will be used as a model system. Transgenic plants will be analyzed, in which photoassimilate transporters are simultaneously overexpressed in the phloem and in cotyledon transfer cells, where assimilate import into the embryo occurs. Potential constraints will be overcome in source to sink transport of photoassimilates to promote sink development and seed storage product accumulation (Aim 1) and to resolve if and how different embryo uptake systems affect seed assimilate flux, metabolism and metabolite compartmentation (Aim 2). Molecular, biochemical, and cell-biological analyses, and physiological techniques, as well as a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assimilate flux studies in living seeds and modeling approaches will be used to answer some long-standing questions about rate limiting and regulatory processes in assimilate transfer to, and distribution and usage within, the main embryo storage sites. The proposed activities will further promote student and public education in plant biology by discussing research schemes in the classroom, by mentoring and training undergraduate and graduate students in research, by engaging students in international collaborations, and through demonstrations and activities involving the local community. Overall, this project will foster effective integration of plant biology education and research."

During SAR, a mobile signal(s) generated at the site of primary infection, moves systemically presumably through the phloem to prepare the non-infected portions of the plant against future infections. However, our knowledge of the intercellular transport of the SAR signal(s) is limited. The investigators have identified several key components of the mobile SAR signal(s) and associated them with specific biochemical signaling pathways responsible for inducing SAR. In this project the investigators will study how these signals are transported during SAR and identify the components involved in their transport. <br/><br/>Although the phloem is the presumed site of signal translocation, little has been done to determine the mechanism of intercellular transport of the SAR inducing signal(s). Potentially, the identification of SAR signal(s) and the knowledge of their dynamic movement could facilitate the use of SAR in protecting agriculturally important plants against a wide range of pathogens. This project will examine the role of dynamic gating (opening and closing) of the plasmodesmata (PD) in SAR induction and assess its relationship to some essential mobile SAR inducers. PD gating will be assessed using dye-loading assays during the time frame of SAR signal generation and movement. Molecular and genetic tools will be used to alter PD gating within this time frame and assess the effect on SAR. Metabolome analysis of petiole exudates from plants defective in both SAR and PD gating will be carried out to determine levels of known SAR inducers and to identify other unknown SAR regulators. Molecular, genetic, and biochemical analyses will be used to characterize the relationship between PD and various SAR related components.  The knowledge gained through this project will facilitate the use of SAR in developing long lasting and broad-spectrum crop protection strategies. Regulation of metabolite transport is fundamental to all aspects of plant development because it affects the movement of metabolites and signaling molecules between cells and across organs. Therefore, this project would provide conceptual advances relevant to both health and disease physiologies of plants. The significant similarity of symplasmic structures in animals and plants extends the relevance of this work to animal physiology. This project will involve training of undergraduate students from local colleges, which in turn will facilitate a partnership between the University of Kentucky and primarily minority and/or underrepresented student-serving institutions in the state.

Ubiquitous components of the environment are microbes, some of which promote plant health (stimulate growth and immunity) and others of which cause disease. Unlike humans, plants lack specialized circulating cells that provide immunity. Instead, plants use a chemical-based immune system. Specifically, natural chemical signals that plants produce confer protection against disease-causing microbes. Upon infection, some of these signals are transported throughout the plant to provide immunity. This project investigates how plant chemical signals and the cellular machinery needed for responding to them confer protection to plants against harmful microbes. Students will work in teams and be trained in experimental methods and data interpretation. The findings from this project could lead to commercialization of these natural immune-modulating chemicals for plant protection.

In humans, it is often considered a less important sense than vision or hearing, and this may explain in part why research has lagged behind that of other senses. Nevertheless, scent detection is a fundamental sense in animals involved in food acquisition, spatial orientation and mating. The wide variation of the sense of smell in animals (from marine mammals with very limited abilities to keen-scented species such as dogs) is affected by anatomical differences and likely has a genetic basis, yet the mechanistic connections between anatomy, genetic variation, gene expression and scent detection are poorly understood. This project uses dogs as a model system to investigate the anatomy and genetics of scent detection. Many dog breeds, such as scent hounds, have been strongly selected for an enhanced sense of smell, whereas other breeds, such as sight hounds, have been selected for visual acuity and are likely to have diminished ability to smell. Other canines, such as short-faced breeds, have impaired breathing and airflow across the nasal passage, which likely affects their sense of smell. Consequently, domestic dogs present a unique long-term experiment in scent detection and provide a range of sensory variation not found within any other mammal species. The results will uncover the mechanisms that enhance or lessen the sense of smell in animals and may allow for predictions of sensory function in a specific ecological context. Further, the results may lead to new biomedical insights for human health and impairments in the sense of smell. <br/><br/>In this project, the full sequence of the canine olfactory repertoire, which includes 1178 olfactory receptor genes, coupled with an analysis of gene expression will be undertaken in about 400 dogs from 26 breeds of varying olfactory ability. The genes will be sequenced using a capture array designed from existing complete genome sequences and the sequencing of gene transcripts (RNA-seq) will be based on olfactory tissue samples. This genetic information will complement anatomical and functional analyses of 66 dogs from the same breeds using high-resolution CT scans that will facilitate reconstruction of the olfactory organ, which will be analyzed and correlated with indices of olfactory sensitivity and olfactory gene repertoire diversity. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of airflow and odorant deposition in anatomically accurate reconstructions of the nasal cavity will be compared across these breeds to determine if the nasal anatomy and architecture of some dogs directs more odorant-laden airflow to the olfactory region of the nose.

The proposed research uses a simple genetic model, the fruit fly, to investigate how cells move as organized groups within the animal. The overall goal of these studies is to identify fundamental mechanisms that keep cells together during cell movement, a poorly understood process. Results from these studies are expected to shed light on the way that cells migrate to populate tissues and organs during animal development. A major impact of the proposed project is the training of students and encouragement of underrepresented groups to pursue scientific-intensive careers. Because of the ease of use and available genetic tools, these studies with the fruit fly model are ideally suited for the training of students. The McDonald lab has a history of training undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, and will continue to do so in the proposed studies. The investigator will specifically recruit female and underrepresented minority undergraduate students from three local institutions that currently offer limited research opportunities. The project also includes several outreach efforts, based on the proposed research, to a local grade school and high school comprised mainly of underrepresented minorities. These activities together will introduce students to research in genetics and animal cell and developmental biology and encourage them to pursue scientific and technical careers.<br/><br/>Throughout development cells frequently move in groups to form, shape and remodel tissues and organs. Such ""collectively"" migrating cells adhere strongly to one another but also coordinate movement of the whole group as a single unit. Despite their crucial importance to development, how cells migrate collectively rather than individually remains poorly characterized. Drosophila border cells represent a genetically accessible model for the discovery of fundamental regulatory pathways that underlie collective cell movement. Dynamic cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate the cellular signaling pathways and physical/cytoskeletal dynamics involved in individual and collective cell migration. While the functions of protein kinases are well established, much less is known about the roles of protein phosphatases. Novel preliminary data indicate that protein phosphatase activity is an unanticipated controller of collective cohesion and migration of border cells. Border cells in which phosphatase activity is inhibited round up, break off from the main group and are unable to complete their migration. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that distinct phosphatase complexes maintain a collective mode of migration through dynamic regulation of identifiable substrates. The proposed project combines genetic, live imaging, cell biology and biochemical approaches to determine which phosphatase complexes regulate collective border cell migration. Moreover, these studies will identify phosphatase target proteins responsible for the collective cohesion and migration of border cells. As common mechanisms underlie different collective cell migration processes, the proposed studies utilizing the powerful border cell model will uncover new cellular and molecular pathways regulated by protein phosphatases. Together, this will critically advance knowledge of how organs form and are remodeled by collectives during development of multicellular organisms."

Eyes are a good system to address this type of question because there is such a diversity of eye types in the animal kingdom.  There are many genes that are known to be important for both vertebrate and invertebrate eye development, but the eye genes that have been studied have only been studied in a very few organisms.  So, it remains unclear how specific eye genes contribute to eye diversity.   To address this question, the PIs have developed tools allowing them to investigate the development of the functionally complex, image-forming eyes of Sunburst Diving Beetle larvae. The beetle larvae eyes are quite different from the commonly studied fruit fly eyes and, in some ways, are more like vertebrate eyes.  In this project, the PIs will compare genes for eye functions in these animals to see what is common and what is different between the two eye systems.  The goal of the project is to understand the molecular basis for functional and structural eye diversity.  This project will provide opportunities for training high school, undergraduate and graduate students to carry out molecular and physiological research.  In addition, monthly outreach activities at the nearby Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden (which houses a large Sunburst Diving Beetle display) will allow the research group to widely disseminate their findings and foster awareness of the value of conducting basic comparative research.   <br/><br/>Preliminary data from this research group suggest that many key genes are present in the eyes of beetles and flies, pointing towards fundamental molecular mechanisms of wide interest.  However, there are informative differences in regards to when and where key genes are active. To investigate this further, the PIs will analyze tissue-specific gene and protein expression profiles (which is only possible in the very enlarged beetle eyes) and determine when and where key eye development genes are expressed within these eyes.  In addition, using a gene knock-down approach in the beetle (Thermonectus marmoratus), developed in the lab, and accompanying state of the art genetic tests in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), different factors will be functionally dissected to compare and contrast the roles of genes associated with Drosophila eye and photoreceptor specification, photoreceptor function and lens development."

These data will be used to generate a computational model of dentate gyrus neurons that predicts the context in which BK channels reduce or enhance neuronal excitability.

The selectivity of a T cell arises from the T cell receptor variant it displays at its surface, with an individual?s T cell population containing a massive  repertoire of distinct T cell receptor variants. However, a subgroup of T cells displays a limited or invariant set of T cell receptors. These so called innate T cells (iT cells) are thought to be rapid responders to infections, recognizing via their T cell receptors conserved molecular determinants in pathogens and providing defense in advance (or absence) of an adaptive immune response. However little is known about how iT cells differentiate or the role they play in immune responses. With preliminary data demonstrating that iT cells are well represented in tadpoles of the frog Xenopus, this project addresses the general hypothesis that the external development of tadpoles requires a capacity to mount rapid immune responses to viruses and bacteria, that the responses be mediated by a small population of immune competent cells, and that these requirements are met by iT cells. This research will extend our understanding of the evolution, biology and importance of iT cells in host/pathogen interactions. It also has the potential to suggest immunologically informed strategies for controlling pathogens and their role in amphibian decline. Undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students will be extensively involved in all aspects of the research, which includes opportunities to study fundamental immunology, development, microbiology and evolution, as well as to learn a range of modern molecular, cellular and reverse genetic techniques.

The research will also use and further develop class Ib tetramers and antibodies to identify distinct iT cell subsets. The specific aims are: (1) To identify and characterize class Ib genes regulating the development and function of distinct iT cell lineages using qPCR, immunohistology and in situ hybridization as well as class Ib-deficient transgenic lines; (2) To characterize distinct class Ib-restricted iT cell lineages in tadpoles and adults using a combination of class Ib tetramers and monoclonal antibodies with flow cytometry, cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy; (3) To elucidate the roles of distinct class Ib-restricted iT cell lineages of tadpoles and adults in vivo during immune response against ecologically relevant pathogens including the ranavirus Frog virus 3, Mycobacterium marinum, and Aeromonas hydrophila.

Trinidadian guppies are an excellent model system to study these effects on behavior because guppies perform a suite of cooperative antipredator behavior that is strongly influenced by social partners and which varies greatly across populations depending on predation risk. This project uses statistical genetics to describe the relative importance of an individual's own genes and those of its social partners for generating cooperation among guppies. This project will also link variation in physiology, gene expression, and sensory anatomy to variation in cooperation across populations. Undergraduates from under-represented groups will be provided long-term comprehensive research and mentorship experiences. An active learning curriculum for evolution classes will be developed. This work will advance our scientific understanding of the genetics of complex traits, including social behavior, while preparing diverse students to be scientists, educators, and mentors.<br/><br/>How interacting phenotypes, such as cooperation, evolve depends on both the genetic architecture of the behavior and the structure of the social environment. This project will describe the complete genetic architecture of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on guppy antipredator behavior, especially as it might vary with changes in social selection imposed by cooperation under differential predation risk. A quantitative genetic breeding design paired with behavioral experiments will measure the influence imposed by and responsiveness to social partners and genetic covariances between those traits for high and low predation populations. Variation in these traits will be correlated with differences in gene expression for hormone receptors and cognate hormone secretion, pheromone excretion, and somatosensory anatomy. Differences in social environments will be characterized by measuring the proportions of individuals in each population that are influential on and/or responsive to social their partners. Lastly, the combination of influential and responsive partners will be varied to measure how well different combinations cooperate, quantifying differences in social selection across populations. This work will provide some of the first experimental links between proximate mechanisms, variation in IGEs, and social selection.  Data will be archived and made publically available through Dryad Digital Repository and GenBank, as appropriate."

Yet, despite this work, little is known about signal evolution from a physiological perspective, particularly with respect to how the nervous system is changed to support the emergence of novel signals. To address this issue, this research project investigates the mechanisms underlying an unusual reproductive communication signal in frogs, known as the ""foot flag.""  By comparing how androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, act on the spinal cord and hind limb muscles in foot-flagging vs. non foot-flagging frogs, this project aims to understand what changes occurred as foot-flagging evolved in this species group.  This project also applies physiological models that have explained motor disease to understanding the evolution of this complex and ecologically relevant behavior.  Results provide insight into how neural systems can evolve and function in the natural environment.  Additionally, the unique collaboration between researchers at a women's college, a research university, and the world-class Vienna Zoo provide hands-on research experiences for 1st and 2nd year undergraduates, particularly women and first-generation college students.  The investigators also incorporate this research into undergraduate courses and fund international research experiences that include public outreach about the biology and conservation of foot-flagging frogs in Borneo, India, and Peru.<br/><br/>This project uses a comparative approach and combines molecular and behavioral analyses to test how the action of androgenic hormones is modified in neuromotor systems to support the evolution of new reproductive communication signals. Prior data shows that the emergence of ""foot flagging"" in male frogs - a signal that is produced by conspicuously waving the hind limb - is marked by a 10-fold increase in the androgenic sensitivity within the skeletal muscles that control this movement. Using quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization to compare androgen receptor levels in foot-flagging vs. non-foot flagging species, this research project tests the hypothesis that changes in expression levels and patterning of androgen receptors within multiple levels of the hindlimb neuromotor pathway are associated with the independent evolution of foot flagging in multiple frog lineages. Furthermore, this project uses pharmacological tools to block androgen receptors in order to test the hypothesis that androgenic signaling in leg muscles is required for foot-flagging behavior and to support the spinal motor circuitry that controls hind limb movement. Though such ""bottom up"" modification of neuromotor circuitry is reported in studies of motor disease, this project is the first study to explore this as a mechanism for regulating a complex and ecologically relevant motor behavior."

This proposal is a collaboration between microbiologists and chemists to identify the specific compounds that pass between phytoplankton and bacteria in surface ocean waters.

The chemical identity of candidate metabolites and evaluation of their potential ecological role will be carried out by exometabolomic analysis of co-cultures with bacterial transporter mutants. Both advanced mass spectrometry and NMR will be used for metabolomics analysis, taking advantage of the sensitivity and compound identification strengths of each. The distribution of candidate metabolites in the ocean microbiome and other microbial systems will be characterized by mining environmental sequence datasets for orthologous transporter genes.

Although this has led to the extinction of many freshwater fish species, some fish species are able to cope and persist despite rapid and severe changes in the environment. In order to predict and curb additional extinctions, there is a critical need to discover what traits might allow some species to persist while others go extinct. This project aims to identify how fish adapt and persist under altered environmental conditions; for example, by asking how fish find mates and reproduce if water clarity is reduced due to muddy run-off from deforested slopes. To accomplish this goal, this project will examine the responses of a wide-spread tropical freshwater fish in Uganda that has persisted under conditions of decreased water clarity and oxygen availability resulting from human activities such as agriculture and deforestation. The study combines surveys of wild-caught fish that develop and live under the inherent variation in natural systems with controlled experiments in the laboratory. This approach provides a unique opportunity to tease apart those traits that allow this fish species to survive and reproduce across a range of environmental stressors. The influence of degraded water quality on fish and humans is of global concern; therefore, this project also aims to create connections between youth in Uganda and in Ohio through a water quality education and virtual exchange program.<br/><br/>Although human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) often leads to biodiversity loss, some species are able to cope with multiple environmental stressors through phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic evolution. Phenotypic change in response to HIREC has been documented in a broad array of taxa; however, we understand very little about when phenotypic change is adaptive and promotes population persistence or is maladaptive and leads to population decline. The proposed project will address the central hypothesis, based on extensive pilot data, that phenotypic changes driven by multiple environmental stressors (e.g. hypoxia and turbidity) are functionally significant and that these trait differences confer fitness advantages under naturally occurring combinations of the stressors. Specifically, the goal is to link HIREC-driven phenotypic change with the adaptive value of trait changes, by determining (1) the functional significance of trait changes, and, (2) the mechanisms by which trait changes confer a fitness advantage. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of known divergence in sensory and behavior traits associated with reproduction in populations of an African cichlid fish experiencing extremes of multiple environmental stressors. The approach proposed will advance our understanding of the key drivers and functional significance of phenotypic change in human-impacted aquatic ecosystems by specifically linking individual phenotype with fitness across generations. More broadly, such understanding will allow predictions to be made about species persistence and mitigation of biodiversity loss under HIREC."

In order to improve drought tolerance in crops, we must understand the ways that non-domesticated plants naturally withstand drought. Plants respond to drought by producing a chemical signal called abscisic acid (ABA); its production relays information about drought from one part of the plant to another and ensures that protective responses occur. ABA gets its message across with the help of special proteins called receptors, which act like switches to turn on protective responses. For unknown reasons, plants have an unusually large number of these switches. The researcher hypothesizes that specific types of switches are more important for drought responses than others. Answering this hypothesis will have broad intellectual merit by illuminating the inner workings of plant cells. In addition, it will have important broader impacts, as it will help in breeding new drought tolerant crops. The researcher will test hypotheses, in part, using synthetic chemicals developed under previous NSF funding. These exciting new chemicals have enabled a partnership between the PI's lab and industry scientists, who seek develop chemicals that to mitigate the effects of drought on crop yield. The current proposal will characterize new chemicals and strengthen academia-industry relationships. This interdisciplinary project will strengthen the PI's deep commitment to mentoring students and post-doctoral scholars, and provide a unique training environment for plant biology, genetics, and chemistry.<br/><br/>The researcher has made key contributions to understanding the function of the ABA receptors and in developing synthetic ABA-mimicking compounds. In spite of the tremendous progress made, our current understanding of ABA receptor function has been hampered by genetic redundancy. This proposal asks a simple question: why do plants need so many ABA receptors? In this proposal, the PI will define which receptors play a predominant role in modulating water relations and systematically dissect the roles of different receptors in mediating ABA's concentration-dependent effects. To do this the PI will employ a series of complementary chemical, genetic, and synthetic biological approaches. In one experimental approach, synthetic small molecules that activate either the high- or low-affinity receptors will be used to interrogate the roles of different receptors in distinct ABA responses. Small molecules are powerful probes of biological pathways but can be limited by ""off-target"" effects that can complicate interpretation of data. To address this limitation, the PI will also use synthetic biological strategies and engineer receptors that can be selectively controlled by a non-natural chemical. The likelihood of structurally unrelated molecules having identical off-target effects is low, therefore this strategy complements the first strategy. Lastly, genome editing will be coupled with classical genetic approaches to generate sets of plants that lack the different receptor subtypes. These materials will be characterized along with the other materials to build an integrated and systematic understanding of the functions of the ABA receptor family."

Within a single group of molluscs, the snails, there is an enormous variety of different shell shapes, but all are variations on the same geometry, the helical spiral.  Because of this underlying simplicity, snail shells are an important model for understanding how new biological structures are formed, but the cellular and developmental mechanisms that generate the shell are unknown.  These researchers examined the patterns of cell division in the tissue that secretes the shell, and discovered two distinct growth zones.  Remarkably, each zone displays cell division patterns that can explain the growth that drives shell shape.  The researchers also found surprising fine-scale patterns in cell shape and gene activity that cause shell formation. The researchers will test the ability of these genes to form shells, and examine these patterns in another species with different shell coiling.   Since snail shells are a familiar example of the great diversity of life, this work will provide an excellent example of the ways that small differences in genes and cells can create new and different shapes.  The project will also enhance training of graduate and undergraduate students, and will create two classroom modules about shell shape to be used for outreach to middle school and high school students in a local high-poverty district.<br/><br/>This project contains three aims to investigate the ability of cell division and gene expression to pattern the helically coiled secreted shells of the snail Ilyanassa.  First, the researchers will define patterns of cell division that putatively contribute to shell shape, then functionally test several signaling pathways that may drive these patterns.  Cell division will then be tested in another snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, to determine if the cell division patterns are conserved, and if strains with opposite coiling chirality have asymmetric division patterns correlated with the direction of shell coiling.  The second aim will discover new candidate regulators of growth, patterning, and mineralization, via sequencing transcriptomes of embryos where shell development has been specifically blocked by cell ablation.  Differentially regulated transcripts will be examined by in situ hybridization to validate their expression in the mantle edge.  Preliminary data suggests that this aim will reveal intricate spatial patterning of the mantle edge, and recover new genes that might be regulating growth and patterning.   Finally, specific gene-knockdown techniques will test the function of putative regulatory factors and mineralization genes.  Preliminary results indicate that they can perturb both shell production and shell morphology.  This project will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that generate the molluscan shell, and provide a cellular-level system for evaluating hypotheses related to mathematical modeling of morphology. The project is also expected to integrate knowledge of biomineralization with developmental biology."

Plants have an analogous fluid called phloem sap, which moves through phloem vessels to carry sugars from photosynthetic organs to the rest of the plant, and to communicate information about nutritional needs, stress or disease between distant plant organs.  Scientists have only a rudimentary understanding of phloem sap-mediated signaling, primarily because it is extremely difficult to collect a phloem sap sample that is not heavily contaminated by fluids from the surrounding cells.  While evidence suggests that hundreds of proteins exist in the phloem sap, only a small number are confirmed to actually move and only one has a known function.  In this project, the researchers will identify hundreds of phloem sap proteins with confirmed long distance movement.  The researcher's novel approach involves grafting two plants with distinct genetic sequences together and then using protein sequence analysis to identify proteins from plant 1 in the phloem vessels of plant 2.  If successful, this project will generate the first large dataset of mobile phloem sap proteins, overcoming the current bottleneck in the field of intra-plant signaling.  The identity of these proteins will catalyze new research directions and will impact a large number of plant biologists.  Phloem signaling is an essential component of the plant's ability to survive biotic and abiotic stresses.  Therefore, this project will suggest new strategies for improving crop plant growth and yield.<br/><br/>Despite the exciting potential of intra-plant communication via phloem-mobile proteins, there is no current consensus as to the identity of the phloem sap proteome in most plants, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana where researchers could best test the function of these proteins.  The PI will use a grafting approach to definitively identify proteins that move long distance through a graft union.  Taking advantage of the extensive sequence data available for over 1000 Arabidopsis accessions, the PI will identify grafting partners where sequence variation leads to amino acid differences in ~1100 predicted phloem sap proteins.  Heterografts will be made, protein samples enriched for phloem sap will be collected from the scion, and Mass Spectrometry will be used to identify rootstock proteins that have travelled to the scion tissue.  The proteome generated by this project will rely on observed protein movement.  This is in contrast to previous attempts in the field to define the phloem sap proteome based on direct phloem sap extraction, a process that is extremely difficult and plagued with technical difficulties.  The definition of hundreds of mobile proteins will overcome the current bottleneck in this field, where the existing phloem sap proteomes are contradictory and generally acknowledged to have large sampling artefacts.  Once in hand, the phloem sap proteome will lead to testable hypotheses about phloem sap signaling based on the identity and function of the mobile proteins."

The current control relies on a live vaccine that has shortcomings, such as, limited efficacy and severe side effects. International efforts to create a rational vaccine to protect against CBPP have been thwarted because of an almost complete lack of genetic tools for this species. As a result, it has been difficult to apply the tools of modern biology to this pressing African need. In this project, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the National Institute for Agronomical Research (INRA) and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) join forces to explore the use of new synthetic biology technologies to genetically manipulate Mmm genomes to identify virulence traits with the ultimate goal of creating strains that can be developed as live vaccine derivatives. These JCVI synthetic biology approaches are a transformational advance in the ability to design and engineer novel bacteria with extraordinary properties to serve human needs. The JCVI work was done using a closely related species to Mmm, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc). During the course of this study, JCVI will continue its work with Mmc, INRA will develop the synthetic biology tools for Mmm as well as the pneumonia-causing strain of Mmc and ILRI will implement the tools and test mutants using in vitro and in vivo assays. While the long term perspective is to use key synthetic biology technologies to produce a safe and efficient Mmm vaccine strain by rationally modifying its genome, the current research is meant to lay the foundation for the development of a modern CBPP vaccine. Several approaches will be pursued. First, the pan genome of the mycoides cluster will be characterized to identify target virulence genes for subsequent mutagenesis. Second, the JCVI synthetic biology tools will be adapted to Mmm at INRA and the synthetic biology technology will be transferred to ILRI in Africa. Third, a caprine model for pulmonary mycoplasma infections will be established with the available tools using the closely related pathogen Mmc. Lastly, the mycoplasma toolbox will be expanded using Mmc as a model in order to enhance the capacity to produce modern Mmm vaccines. The consequences of success will be dramatic and pervasive as not only a novel approach to making vaccines against infectious diseases caused by mycoides cluster members will have been demonstrated but newly developed technical methods will have been transferred to a major research institution in Africa that is capable of sustaining and improving upon what JCVI and INRA seek to accomplish.<br/><br/>This research project will have a major impact on livestock farming in Africa where CBPP is a significant problem.  The methods used here will enable the development of vaccine candidates that could not be created previously for this disease.  This study also has the potential to revolutionize the area of mycoplasma biology because the methods discussed here will be applied to other members of mycoides cluster and may be applied to mycoplasma pathogens of humans, animals and plants for which there are no tractable genetic methods.  An important component involves training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students as well as undergraduate students as summer interns in the foundations of molecular research.  The students will gain valuable insight to cutting-edge research areas such as the new discipline of synthetic biology.  The research will also help capacity building of a research institute in a developing country and provide scientific training to an underrepresented segment of society. Information from this study will in the long term benefit the livestock-dependent people by enabling them to increase their protein source from cattle and by reducing restrictions on the trade of cattle and bovine products.  The collaborating institutions recognize the need to make the biological resources available to the scientific community.  Genome sequencing data of the mycoides cluster will be deposited as rapidly as possible in publically accessible databases such as Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). All biological resources developed under this project will be made available to outside researchers through ILRI and INRA who have agreed to serve as repositories for the strains and to review all requests for materials upon receipt."

Exactly how different species compete with each other for this iron is poorly understood. This project uses state-of-the-art methods to evaluate whether one well established mechanism in brewer's yeast may also be operating in marine diatoms or whether these organisms use novel, previously undescribed, mechanisms for iron uptake. The collection of massive data sets on thousands of proteins will reveal proteins that are turned on in response to low iron conditions, and newly emerging genetic tools will allow us to robustly test which proteins could be directly responsible for iron uptake. This will dramatically improve the understanding of these ecologically important organisms.  More broadly speaking, this may lead to a better understanding of iron uptake in other related organisms, which include human and agricultural pathogens.  The investigators will work closely with high school students from under-represented groups and engage them in STEM activities tightly linked to the project.  Hands on experiments will be conducted to communicate the concepts of nutrient uptake, using lakes across an urban-rural gradient as the classroom.  Additional exercises will introduce students to the cutting-edge approaches that identify thousands of proteins. Select HS students will work in the investigator's laboratories. The attitudes and perceptions of these students will be evaluated to gauge the effect of the experience on their understanding of, and desire to engage in, STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The chromalveolates, which include diatoms and haptophytes, are the most successful and biogeochemically significant eukaryotic phytoplankton in the contemporary ocean. The evidence for iron (Fe) limitation in the oceans has led to an emphasis to understand how phytoplankton compete for and acquire Fe, but this is in its adolescence (diatoms) or infancy (Phaeocystis). This work will resolve long-standing controversies regarding the mechanisms of Fe uptake in a model diatom, T. pseudonana, and the haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa. Objectives include to quantify the proteomes of these species grown under low and high Fe (with recent advances in proteomic methodology), further utilize robust emergent reverse genetics tools to evaluate the localization of key proteins and couple these approaches with kinetics to determine which proteins and redox states are important for Fe uptake. MS^E-based proteomics with ion mobility spectrometry, ideally suited for quantifying cell surface proteins, will be used. Then, for T. pseudonana, knockdown and over-expression clones will be used to confirm localization and test phenotypic responses under varied conditions. Fe uptake and Fe(II) production rates by these clones will help determine which proteins and Fe redox states are important for Fe uptake. Manipulations of gene expression for putative diatom Fe acquisition proteins will be emphasized to address specific hypotheses, but these approaches may also be adapted to take advantage of any novel proteins derived from proteomics. Full participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines will be realized at various educational levels, and the success of these efforts with HS students will be evaluated."

Characterizing the genetic and physiological basis of local climatic adaptation is especially critical for assessing whether and how plant species, including crops, can persist through periods of environmental change.  Using the widely-adapted species white clover, this project examines the factors that allow this plant to thrive in climates as dramatically different as northern Minnesota and central Florida.  The production of cyanide-containing compounds appears to play a role in this process, particularly for adaptation to heat and drought.  These compounds are also found in several important crop species, and their importance for drought adaptation will be examined in detail for the first time.  Other aspects of natural genetic and physiological variation in climate tolerance will be assessed through field experiments.  The project will provide classroom materials and curricular activities for an ongoing and highly successful inquiry-based educational outreach program developed by the principle investigator, which has already engaged more than 8000 students and 100 teachers nationwide. Students sample and analyze their local clover populations and contribute data to an online database, where they can compare observations with classes from other climates.  Scientific training will be provided to undergraduates, including those from minority backgrounds, as well as two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>Adaptation to local environments plays a key role in the ability of plant species to survive and persist through environmental change, yet the genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie this process are largely unknown. Through work that integrates QTL mapping of fitness traits, candidate gene analyses of two well-characterized biochemical polymorphisms, and physiological assessments of their fitness impacts, the following questions are addressed, using white clover (Trifolium repens) as a study system: 1) What is the genetic architecture of local climatic adaptation?  Specifically, to what extent does it arise through fitness tradeoffs for alternate alleles of individual genes (antagonistic pleiotropy), or through combinations of loci where individual genes provide a fitness benefit in one environment and are selectively neutral in others (conditional neutrality)? 2) What are the physiological mechanisms by which cyanogenic glycosides function in abiotic stress adaptation? 3) What is the role of gene copy number variation (CNVs) in local adaptation?  This work will rigorously test the function of cyanogenic glycosides, which are found in >3,000 plant species including many crops, in abiotic stress adaptation.  CNVs are abundant in the genomes of many taxa, and the project will directly assess their role in local climatic adaptation, which has not previously been done. The project will also engage high school students and teachers nationwide in hands-on, inquiry-based learning through an ongoing and highly successful outreach program based on clover cyanogenesis, and it will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates."

Adult perceptual learning allows an organism to survive by adapting its responses to salient sensory stimuli in its environment, such as salient sounds, and relies on intact function of the primary auditory cortex (A1). Neither the time course, nor the molecular mechanisms underlying this form of learning are currently known. Previous work supported by NSF showed that, unlike the current notions of A1 plasticity during auditory perceptual learning, the early stages are marked with a wide-spread reshaping of A1 with some areas of decreased, while others of increased responsiveness. Importantly, these opposing, but concurrently-occurring, changes rely on the learning-induced synthesis of a protein necessary for synaptic plasticity and learning, Arc. A primary goal here is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how Arc interacts with several other proteins to simultaneously direct these divergent changes.  The hypothesis is that decreased responsiveness is due to interactions with proteins that enhance endocytosis of receptors that increase synaptic excitability, while enhancement of responses is due to Arc's interaction with other proteins leading to dendritic spine reshaping. This idea will be tested by assessing the relative abundance of these proteins in areas with electrophysiologically-documented decrease or increase of responsiveness, respectively. Other predictions of the model will be tested by measuring the electrophysiological responses across A1 at different stages of learning. The data will be used to create a computational model of perceptual learning. The broader impact of this work includes involvement of minority undergraduates from several disciplines, as well as professional training of postdoctoral fellows. Developing a working team that includes students from several local universities will result in developing a public resource, a website with several age-appropriate sections that introduce cortical plasticity and cortically-supported learning and memory."

The experiments focus on the biogenesis, precise localization, and quantification of these 24-nucleotide RNAs, the proteins that utilize them for anther functions, and their role in plant fertility. Prior work demonstrated that these small RNAs are required for robust male fertility under even slight temperature stress: without them anther development fails.  The project will focus on maize anthers because it is easy to determine accurately what developmental stage they are in, they are easy to dissect, there are numerous developmental mutants that affect anthers for which the gene has been isolated, and because understanding male fertility is important to the production of hybrid corn seed. A more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of pollen development enables improvements in seed production, including hybrid seeds; in the grasses, hybrid corn and rice have significantly boosted world food production. Outcomes of this project could include discovering new genetic pathways for more precise control of male fertility in plants, and plants with fertility that is more resilient to environmental change. The project will utilize plant genomics and targeted mutagenesis, cutting-edge imaging techniques, bioinformatics, with a focus on developmental biology. Broader impacts of the project include training of students in plant and computational biology via continued integration with long-running and successful undergraduate and high school internship programs. <br/><br/>The project will focus specifically on the class of 24-nt phased, secondary siRNAs, known as ""24-nt phasiRNAs"" that are highly enriched in meiotic-stage anthers. The work will be done in maize as the primary species for analysis because there are significant, existing genetic and molecular resources. The project will address several important questions. Do meiotic cells differ from somatic cells in the accumulation of small RNAs and their functions? Which transcription factors guide the transitions required for setting cell fate and differentiation of cell type-specific properties that include phasiRNAs? How are meiotic-stage small RNAs deployed to guide anther cell fate and differentiation? Where and when do the microRNA triggers, precursor mRNAs, and biogenesis or effector proteins accumulate? The project will characterize phenotypes and molecular genetic analysis of loss-of-function knock-out mutations that impact phasiRNAs, including mutations of the Dicer-like5 (Dcl5) gene, for which preliminary data demonstrate male sterility. Project members will be trained broadly in plant small RNA biology and genomics, cell biology and microscopy, and computational methods through their individual and group projects in the analysis of the localization, biogenesis, and biochemistry of small RNAs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific focus is on the fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the cause of white mold disease in soybean, sunflower, cole crops, pulse crops and a variety of others. In total, this agricultural pathogen infects over 600 plant species and accounts for an estimated $200 million in annual economic loss in the U.S. Market losses can be extremely high when disease outbreaks occur on a large scale; the U.S. soybean stem rot outbreak in 2009, for instance, directly reduced harvests by approximately $560 million. In the field, diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum are challenging to control for the lack of resistant cultivars effective against this pathogen and the long survival properties of the fungus. In Florida, losses occurring in crops of green bean, carrot, Brassica carinata, bell pepper and cabbage are of perennial concern. This research addresses the need to elucidate the genetically based mechanisms of S. sclerotiorum that are required for its aggressiveness and the genetic factors from the host that account for susceptibility or resistance to the pathogen. This information is fundamentally important for the long-term purpose of developing effective disease control strategies against this devastating fungal pathogen. This research will have the broader impact of training undergraduates recruited from the University of Florida Undergraduate Research Minority Participation Program in molecular genetic techniques using cutting edge tools for genome manipulation. <br/><br/>This project aims to elucidate factors that underlie the establishment of basic compatibility in broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. The working model is that these pathogens, exemplified by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, utilize a two-phase strategy for establishing basic compatibility and host colonization. From this model two hypotheses are possible.The first hypothesis is that basic host-pathogen compatibility across a broad range of hosts is established by pathogen targeting of universally conserved host targets (e.g., MED16). The alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that these pathogens have evolved and utilize independent virulence factors and effectors for different hosts to overcome host-specific defenses (e.g., glucosinolates). One discovery-based and two targeted Specific Objectives will test these hypotheses. The first is to create and phenotype gene-specific loss-of-function mutations for select members of the predicted S. sclerotiorum secretome chosen from transcriptome data. The second objective is to characterize the pathway of Arabidopsis Mediator complex subunit 16 (MED16) protein modification and degradation to understand its role in broad host range necrotrophic pathogen susceptibility and resistance. The final objective is to determine the role of MED16 degradation in host susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum and other broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. Plant disease resistance to this class of pathogens lags behind the understanding of other classes of host-pathogen interactions. The genetically complex nature of these interactions is a major factor limiting understanding. Utilizing new molecular genetic tools and genomic resources, the proposed research will establish greater mechanistic understanding of broad host range necrotrophic pathogen-host compatibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through improvements in agriculture over the last century, corn yields have increased significantly across the U.S. Despite these advances, agriculture currently faces significant environmental challenges, from increasing water stress to spread of new diseases. New breeding approaches are thus needed to produce resilient plants and to maintain the health and productivity of maize agriculture. Major new advances in this arena come from recent discoveries in maize genetics and genomics: Researchers have identified key factors in the genome that serve as ""master regulators"" to control expression of important traits. Currently, little is known about when or where these factors function or how they control traits. The project uses all-new technologies to find and characterize hidden sites of expression control in the genome, and tests their function. The breakthroughs from this research will provide new ways to generate crop resilience and will improve the breeding potential of maize. Through public websites, outcomes from the project are made available to other researchers, growers and breeders, thereby ensuring a coordinated community effort to improve maize research and agriculture. Students and post-doctoral researchers are trained in crop genomics to maintain the strength, continuity and security of the scientific enterprise in the U.S. <br/><br/>Elucidating gene regulatory networks involves linking the cis-regulatory code (cistrome) with the trans-acting factors through identifiying protein-DNA interactions. The cistrome hinges on where transcription initiation starts, which must be empirically defined. Differences in gene expression between inbred lines contribute to hybrid vigor, and are ultimately a consequence of cis- and trans-acting variations that affect the protein-DNA interaction space. Understanding these variations provides opportunities to accelerate crop breeding. Building on the team's previously developed tools to identify protein-DNA interactions, this interdisciplinary project has three main objectives: 1) Establish the genome-wide landscape of transcriptional initiation in maize, 2) develop a comprehensive catalog of maize gene regulatory interactions, and 3) incorporate functional transcription factor information to accelerate trait discovery. The project will continue to develop genome-wide tools necessary for plant gene regulatory network dissection, and build the knowledge necessary to enable similar studies in other crops. Data will be visualized through the Web-accessible knowledge base GRASSIUS (www.grassius.org) and MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) to ensure the broadest possible dissemination of results. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will be integrated with the training of undergraduate students through the FIRE (Fostering Integration of Research and undergraduate Education) program, and recently graduated students from underrepresented groups through the SIGuE (Success In Graduate Education) program."

However, resistance to most generalist pathogens is quantitative and cannot be investigated using few genotypically distinct individuals. This project will begin one of the first direct surveys of how genomic diversity within and across core plant lineages may be shaped by genomic diversity in a broad spectrum generalist fungus that can infect most if not all plants. This will lead to the development of novel biological and statistical methods to handle genomic diversity across phylogenetic lineages and provide a unique multi-plant species dataset that is currently only feasible with Botrytis cincerea.  All data and analysis protocols will be publicly available and microbial isolates will be available upon request pending the acquisition of the appropriate permits.  With regard to training, the project will provide research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. These students will be trained in modern quantitative genetics of complex traits to prepare them for future careers in industry or academics. As this is the one of the first instances of attempting to do quantitative genetics in two interacting species, this will place them at the forefront of the field in both theory and computational applications. Undergraduates will develop and devise their own projects within the frame of this project. Any publication resulting from this research will likely include at least one undergraduate student as a co-author who was integral in designing and interpreting the experiments. In addition, the principal investigator will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant metabolism, plant defense evolution, and quantitative genomics. <br/><br/>Plant/pathogen interactions determine plants fitness/yield. Most research on plant/pathogen interactions focuses on epidemic diseases from pathogens that infect only one or a few species similar to the human flu. However, this has led to a paucity of research on pathogens that are endemic, like Botrytis cinerea or the common cold, which can infect most host genotypes but only cause a low level of economic loss. These generalist pathogens place evolutionary pressure across plant lineages, yet this cross-lineage pressure is rarely systematically addressed. For example, it is currently not known if there is a common plant defense network against these generalist pathogens that can function in all plants. To test this question, this project aims to: 1) measure lesion development with a high-throughput platform across six plant species that have independently undergone domestication (lettuce, tomato, grape, soy and Brassicas) with 100 genome sequenced isolates of the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea; 2) use the genome wide association mapping dataset to identify pathogenicity networks within the pathogen that allow it to infect these diverse hosts; 3) identify and validate plant gene targets of these networks using a new co-species co-expression network approach to test if the pathogen targets defense mechanisms that are conserved or variant across plants and if these defense mechanisms have been affected by human driven domestication; and 4) conduct transcriptome profiling across these plant/pathogen combinations to identify conserved or variant transcriptional responses across the eudicot lineages. By including domestic and wild genotypes in each plant species this project will provide a common reference frame in which to study how domestication may or may not consistently influence plant defenses. In the longer term, this information will provide for a better understanding of how selection pressures drive the evolution of defenses within eudicot lineages towards generalist pathogens."

A key activity will be to develop and characterize the publicly available soybean fast neutron (FN) mutagenesis population with a goal of attaining a biologically relevant amount of genomic coverage.  Concurrently, individual genes within FN deleted regions that alter traits of importance to the soybean community (e.g., yield, oil, protein, stress tolerance, and nitrogen fixation) will be mutated using CRISPER/Cas9 technology to pinpoint the genes responsible for specific phenotypes. In addition, a set of complementary, transposon-based mutagenesis populations will be made to specifically tailor gene discovery for the highly duplicated genome of soybean. TheTnt1 insertional mutagenesis population will result in traditional loss-of-function phenotypes, the Ac/Ds activation tagging population will cause gene mis-expression, and the mPing transposon will be used for both gene silencing and overexpression. These strategies are expected to result in recovery of novel phenotypes not previously observed in soybean.

A major limitation to shoot size (and productivity) arises from adverse soil conditions, such as drought, compaction, and saline conditions.  Plant roots are biological sensors that detect these adverse conditions, and by an unknown mechanism, cause the shoot system to slow or arrest growth.  This project will test whether the root-to-shoot stress signal is the same mobile signaling molecule that is produced in Arabidopsis bps1 mutants.  BYPASS (BPS) proteins function to prevent synthesis of a small metabolite, the bps signal, which moves from the root and arrests shoot growth.  The principle investigator hypothesizes that the bps signal is a previously undescribed plant hormone, and preliminary data indicate that it stops growth by interfering with stem cell identity.  Approaches include a full analysis of gene expression changes in shoots treated with the bps signal, and molecular and genetic experiments to uncover the mechanism of bps signal gene regulation.  Experiments will also investigate whether, in normal plants, the bps signal is produced in response to stress.  These experiments will use transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carry markers that respond to the bps signal and will use metabolomic approaches to measure bps signal levels.  These investigations are critical for developing strategies to reducing agricultural crop losses due to soil-related stresses.

Some, like tomato, rice, beans and other cultivated species, cast pollen from male to female organs in the same flower. Others employ ingenious schemes to ensure that one individual pollinates the flower of another. Persimmon, pistachio, kiwi, hops, and spinach are amongst the few percent of plant species in which these functions are found in separate individuals, a condition called dioecy. In mammals maleness or femaleness are determined by X and Y chromosomes: males have an X and a Y and females have two Xs. A single gene on the Y is responsible for triggering the development of male traits. Most dioecious plants resemble the human system, with XY males and XX females. But what gene(s) may be responsible for determining whether a particular plant carries male or female flowers has been a long-standing mystery. Recently, the authors combed through the genomes of persimmon trees looking for genes that were exclusive to males and found pair of genes, called OGI and MeGI. In females, MeGI builds to high level and acts like a neutering agent, repressing pollen formation. In males, OGI prevents the accumulation of MeGI. Discovery of the OGI-MeGI system in persimmon opens up new possibilities in plant breeding. Controlling flower organs is also important for facilitating production of high yielding hybrids from controlled hybridization of selected inbreds. Broader impacts include an outreach aimed at increasing skills and confidence in Big Data Analysis for high school or early college students of underpresented background. Additionally, because dioecy evolved independently many times in plants, this work provides a foundation to ask whether plants invented similar or different solutions to the same problem.<br/><br/>These results cast light on the organization of a plant Y chromosome and provide a working model for dioecy determination in Diospyros species. The authors aim to capitalize on these findings to further investigate the molecular function of the OGI and MeGI genes, as well as ask more general questions about the evolution of dioecy determination in dioecious species. Their specific objectives are to: 1) Define the Y chromosome in Diospyros lotus using a combination of sequencing and genetic approaches 2) Unravel the molecular function of OGI and MeGI using transgenic technology in A. thaliana and genome-wide genomic analyses in Diospryros and 3) Characterize variation in the Y-chromosome dioecy determination region in Diospyros and closely-related species and test whether similar systems are at play in other dioecious systems. This work provides a model for unraveling dioecy determination systems in economically-relevant plant species, an area important for human sustenance and well being."

Modern agriculture depends upon chemical N fertilizers that cause extensive environmental damage and are not sustainable. In contrast to the majority of crops, legumes (such as soybean, bean, lentils, alfalfa) form symbiotic associations with soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of nodules in which the bacteria accumulate in high numbers and fix atmospheric N for the plant. Because of N-fixing ability, legumes play an important role in sustainability in both agricultural and natural environments. However, many tree legumes do not form nodules and are thus considered non-N fixing. Many non-nodulating legumes are important components of various ecological systems and are increasingly being used for land reclamation and as biofuel crops. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which non-nodulating legumes obtain their nitrogen will be crucial in improving the utilization of these legumes in nutrient-poor soils. The project will provide opportunities to undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow to train in both microbial and plant biology, especially as they relate to plant-microbial interactions. The benefits of research on microbial symbioses will also be emphasized in the urban agriculture initiative at UW Milwaukee. <br/><br/>Legumes are by far the largest contributors of biologically fixed N2 to pristine environments. Although nodulation is often considered to be a distinguishing characteristic of legumes, a large number of species are not known to nodulate. Non-nodulating legumes live in the same native environments as their nodulating 'cousins' and yet have the same in planta N concentrations. Very little , however, is known about the mechanisms of N-acquisition in non-nodulated legumes. This project will explore the hypothesis that non-nodulating legume honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.) possesses the potential for symbiotic N2 fixation with rhizobia. Preliminary data from the investigator's laboratory shows the presence of nodule-like structures on the roots of G. triacanthos that contained rhizobia.

Giovannoni (USDA-ARS/Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research)<br/> <br/>Fleshy fruit are unique plant developmental systems and provide important components of human and animal diets. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), an economically important crop, has emerged as the principal model for studies of fleshy fruit development, ripening, shelf life and nutritional quality. However, many fundamental questions related to key aspects of the development, physiology, quality traits and environmental responses of fleshy fruit remain unanswered. This project will decipher complex problems in plant biology that are also central to fleshy fruit development and quality: (i) the regulatory processes that influence fruit growth and ripening; (ii) the associated hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways; and (iii) molecular events that result in cell wall formation and restructuring, and that provide protection from environmental stresses. An important element of this project is the development of a strong education and training component. This will take the form of two programs: (1) an annual Plant Genomics and Systems Biology Workshop, comprising a series of integrated 'technology modules' with both seminars and lab-based practical training in 'omics disciplines'; (2) a multi-level training course in Scientific Communication, providing guidance in both oral and written presentation skills. These will be affiliated with undergraduate students, high school students and high school teachers, with particular emphasis on the participation of under-represented groups through the support of a network of existing Cornell programs. <br/><br/>Studies to date have provided valuable initial insights into the identity and temporal expression patterns of some of the genes that regulate fruit development; however, they have almost exclusively used total tomato fruit pericarp ('flesh') and have largely ignored spatial variation in global gene expression in the different constituent cell types. The goal of this project is to extend these studies to characterize the responses of fruits to drought, an increasing problem in crop production, in tomato using cutting edge genomics technologies. These studies will be extended to two diverse wild relatives of tomato that show a high tolerance of water stress, and so may provide opportunities for crop improvement. The expected outcomes are: A) the Tomato Expression Atlas (TEA), a gene expression database for cultivated tomato and wild relatives, and new insights into the regulatory circuitry that controls fruit development and responses to drought, at a cell/tissue type level of resolution; B) detailed information about the tissue specificity of hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, and cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling during fruit development in tomato and wild relatives, and following drought treatments.  Public access to all data and biological materials will be through the Tomato Expression Atlas (TEA) website and long-term public repositories. All DNA sequences will be released to the public domain immediately after generation and quality control through Genbank (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and SGN (http://solgenomics.net). Raw RNA-Seq, sRNA-seq and BS-seq datasets generated under this project will be submitted to NCBI SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) for long term storage and public access while processed expression and methylation profiles will be archived and accessed through the TEA and through the Tomato Functional Genomics Database (http://solgenomics.net/ted) and the Tomato Epigenome database (http://ted.bti.cornell.edu/epigenome)."

In comparison to plants grown without microbes in the soil, yields can be twice as great when plants are grown with their full complement of soil microbes. Microbes may improve plant growth by making soil nitrogen more available to plants. From the point of view of plant growth and eventual yield, nitrogen is important as it is a critical component of one enzyme, Rubisco, which takes carbon dioxide from the air and converts it to sugars for growth through the process of photosynthesis. To identify how microbes improve plant growth, the current research examines 1. how microbes modify soil chemistry, 2. what plant genes are selectively turned on in response to the presence of microbes, 3. how plant processes like photosynthesis respond to microbes, and 4. what the identity and functions are of the soil microbes. Connecting results from these four sets of data will reveal what it is that promotes plant growth, from the soil to the whole-plant level. This research also includes ways to predict plant growth and yield in response to soil microbes when different amounts of nitrogen are added to the soil, which should enable reduced use of fertilizers. The plant being studied is Brassica rapa, which is grown around the world as root (turnip), leaf (cabbage, pak choi), and oilseed (canola) crops; because of the diverse uses of this crop, results from this species are expected to apply to a wide range of other crops. Soil microbes are an important part of the ecosystem, and connect plants to the physical environment. While much is known about the plants in natural and agricultural settings, less is known about the distributions, types, and functions of beneficial soil microbes, and how they help crops cope with poor growing conditions such as drought or lack of nitrogen. The current research fills these knowledge gaps, and will provide recommendations on how to manage soils for beneficial microbes. Broader impacts to this work include development of guided tours within the Williams Conservatory, Geology Museum, and Berry Center for Biodiversity at the University of Wyoming as well as teaching modules related to the study of evolution and crop domestication. <br/><br/>Soil microorganisms serve a range of ecosystem services that promote plant growth under stressful abiotic conditions, including nitrogen limitation. Yet, soil microbial communities represent a largely untapped source for yield improvement in crop species. Analyzing plant transcriptomic and physiological responses to taxonomically and functionally diverse soil microbiomes will provide insights as to the mechanisms by which microbes enhance plant growth. Further, Bayesian systems modeling of plant transcriptomic, hydraulic, and gas-exchange responses to the soil microbial environment can provide a predictive understanding of plant growth promotion by microbes under variable nitrogen amendments. When grown with an intact vs. reduced soil microbiome, crops of Brassica rapa upregulate gas-exchange and increase biomass accumulation up to two-fold, suggesting one physiological link between plant transcriptomic responses to soil microbes and eventual plant biomass accumulation. Because B. rapa is domesticated as root, leaf, and oilseed crops, mechanisms of growth promotion characterized in this species could translate to a range of other crops. Further, the microbiome associated with the rhizosphere of B. rapa is highly differentiated from that of bulk soils more distant from the roots, suggesting the species is an effective model for studying the assembly dynamics, identity, and function of beneficial plant-associated soil microbes. Using next-generation amplicon and metagenome sequencing of rhizosphere DNA in combination with plant genomic, transcriptomic, and physiological experiments, the research will characterize mechanisms of plant growth promotion by soil microbes and test predictive systems models. The research addresses the PGRP 2014 focal areas: to develop a genome-level link between genes and physiological functions in crop plants and to develop a genome to systems-level understanding of plant-environmental interactions, especially with respect to abiotic stress. Broader impacts to this work include development of guided tours and teaching modules related to crop domestication and improvement as well as development of management practices for beneficial microbes.

The cells in the edible parts of corn, beans, rice, wheat, and peas undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication where the cells replicate their DNA many times. Although individual cells undergo different amounts of endoreduplication, the proportion of cells remains constant from plant to plant. When geneticists try to increase endoreduplication, they find that the response of seemingly identical cells is somewhat random: some cells respond strongly, some moderately, and some not at all. This observation raises one of the biggest questions in developmental biology: how do identical cells make different decisions? The proposed research will investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that individual plant cells make these decisions about how much to endoreduplicate utilizing small, random molecular differences. This hypothesis is surprising: biologists would normally expect randomness to be suppressed, since development is highly reproducible, always creating the same proportion of endoreduplicated cells. Instead, randomness may in fact be required to produce this regular portion of endoreduplicated cells. Testing this hypothesis will require advanced use of computers to examine individual cells over time. University students and middle school girls will simultaneously be involved in this analysis as well as being trained in computational skills.<br/><br/>Endoreduplicating cells of crop plants are buried deep within the seed coat where they are experimentally inaccessible. Endoreduplication will thus be studied in Arabidopsis thaliana sepals, whose epidermal cells are accessible for live imaging as they endoreduplicate. The transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) drives sepal endoreduplication, and may cause it to occur randomly. Since ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells, it is unclear how ATML1 causes only a few cells to endoreduplicate. Preliminary data show that ATML1 triggers endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner: high ATML1 makes all epidermal cells endoreduplicate, low ATML1 prevents any endoreduplication, and individual sepal cells have varying levels of ATML1. The hypothesis tested here is that randomly fluctuating ATML1 causes different levels of endoreduplication in different cells; a few cells exceed ATML1's threshold, triggering endoreduplication, while other cells remain below the threshold and do not endoreduplicate. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ATML1 fluctuations initiate endoreduplication. The associated education goal will be to work with undergraduate students to analyze images generated in this aim. For Aim 2, we will determine whether ATML1 feedback loops drive endoreduplication by amplifying differences in ATML1 expression and, in an associated educational aim, students will write and publish a computational modeling glossary to better understand the newly generated models. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the molecular mechanism through which ATML1 induces endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner. We will also develop an outreach to middle school students for the analysis of images from Aim 3 in a hands-on, web-based image analysis workshop."

While it has since spread globally and today has the greatest global geographic breadth of 16 staple crops, corn continues to perform poorly in the cold. However, farmers in various regions do cultivate corn in cool, wet mountainous regions as high as 12,000 ft above sea level. This project will identify the genetic changes that allowed corn to adapt to high elevations. The investigators will compare agronomic and genetic traits of corn varieties sampled at high elevation with those from nearby lowland regions in field experiments conducted at high, middle, and lowland sites. These experiments will reveal the genes underlying high-elevation adaptation and will measure the repeatability of the genetic changes underlying adaptation. Results from this investigation will inform the development of cold-hardy corn lines for high-elevation and high-latitude (e.g. U.S. Corn Belt) regions. Insight as to how adaptation occurred in highland conditions can also be applied more broadly to adapting maize to other environmental conditions.

This project seeks to evaluate environmental adaptation in maize (Zea mays), with focus on adaptation to high elevation environments in wild and domesticated populations of maize. Highland and lowland environments differ in a number of features including temperature and precipitation, and maize adaptation to these environments has involved agronomically relevant phenotypes. The first objective is to identify quantitative trait loci for adaptive traits using mapping populations developed from Mexican and South American maize, a naturally admixed population of teosinte (i.e., wild maize) and two populations of introgression lines donated by industry collaborators. This will enable the comparison of the loci controlling highland traits in distinct geographical regions, across elevations, and in multiple genetic backgrounds including elite US maize germplasm. The second objective is to investigate population genetic evidence of selection through studies of adaptive introgression in maize and teosinte, and divergence in gene expression between lowland and highland maize. The third objective is to characterize the functional consequences of an adaptive inversion polymorphism via phenotypic and transcriptomic evaluation of introgression lines. This basic research will be complemented by outreach activities including phenotyping workshops to demonstrate high-throughput field data collection methods, student exchanges, and farmer field exhibitions in conjunction with a breeding center in Mexico."

Among herbivores that feed on plant tissues, insects are by far the best characterized. However, plant-feeding mites, which are distant relatives of insects, can also be major pests in agriculture. In particular, many mite species thrive on and damage drought-stressed plants, including major cereal crops like maize and wheat. Under these situations, mites pose a significant challenge for control as they are often resistant to commonly used pesticides. Plants can defend themselves against attack and damage by herbivores.  For example, for a number of plant species, certain varieties are known to be more resistant to mites than others because of their ability to produce compounds toxic to herbivores. The objective of this research is to understand the genetic and genomic nature of plant defense pathways that function to deter agriculturally important mites. The mite species to be examined are the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis) that are associated with significant outbreaks on drought-stressed maize or other cereal species. The research will use genomic and genetic methods to elucidate which plant defense pathways in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) respond to mite herbivory, and how variation in these pathways impacts plant resistance. Moreover, the effect of drought (water stress) on these defense pathways will be assessed, an objective motivated by the observation that each of these pests can be economically damaging during droughts. This project has relevance, therefore, to efforts to develop more mite resistant crop plants. All data will be accessible to the public through long-term public repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and MaizeGDB. Biological resources generated during the project will be available upon request. As part of the project, the work will train undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars.  In addition, educational material will be developed on plant-mite interactions for distribution to the public on the Learn.Genetics website (http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/).<br/><br/>To identify genetic pathways in plants that respond to spider mite pests, gene expression profiling using the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) will be performed on maize and barley leaves infested with both two-spotted spider mites (a generalist pest on both dicot and monocot plants) and Banks grass mites (a specialist pest on grasses). Further, to understand the effect of an agriculturally important abiotic stress on plant defense pathways, expression profiling for mite responses will be performed on both well watered and water stressed plants. Comparisons of plant transcriptional response to the two herbivores, and as a function of an abiotic stress relevant to mite outbreaks, will shed light on the specificity of plant responses to generalist and specialist herbivores, and how the environment affects the interaction in plants. A specific outcome will be the identification of gene regulatory networks underlying mite resistance. Further, susceptibility to mite damage is known to vary among individuals within plant species, including maize. To investigate this, a collection of inbred maize lines used to create the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) community genetic mapping resource will be screened for susceptibility or resistance to each mite herbivore. Gene expression studies with sensitive and resistant maize lines will then be used to assess the genomic basis of variation in plant mite resistance. In parallel, and to relate plant molecular phenotypes of mite response to plant performance upon mite infestation in an agricultural setting, field trials for resistance will be performed on plants under high water and drought stress conditions for a subset of maize inbred lines."

Deciphering how a plant responds to salinity and regulates its cellular ion fluxes is essential to understanding and potentially improving photosynthesis. This  project identifies specific genes that control ion fluxes and responses to salinity in plants using a specialized imaging system and analysis tools to study their role in plant productivity.

By pursing multi-day phenotyping with dynamic growth lighting, the team has isolated new candidate thylakoid ion flux mutants. The researchers will study the compromised genes and their link to known thylakoid ion flux mediators by pursuing the following aims: (i) complete the thylakoid ion transport protein inventory; (ii) determine the role of thylakoid ion flux interactions in photosynthesis and hyperosmotic stress resistance; (iii) identify the process by which thylakoid ion flux impacts the hyperosmotic stress response; (iv) analyze thylakoid ion flux impacts on key agronomical traits in crop plants; and (v) generate a model for simulating increases to photosynthetic efficiency and salt stress resistance as a function of thylakoid ion flux. The Flux4LIVES project has several broader impacts. Photosynthesis is arguably the most important reaction on earth and a foundation for life. With clear evidence that growth conditions in the field have become more adverse recently, a detailed understanding on how abiotic stress impacts this reaction pathway is needed. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect photosynthesis and plant productivity will be key to improving these pathways and thus securing necessary levels of global food production. Since the data obtainedwill be open-access via the existing PhotosynQ database, the global scientific community can apply the knowledge to their own biological and ecological questions and thus further the effort to meet food demands across varying climates and conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hake.<br/><br/>Increasing crop yield during drought is a critical challenge for U.S. corn production. The male flowering structure or tassel of the corn plant makes several branches, which produce the pollen necessary for fertilizing female flowers found in corn ears. During severe drought early in the growing season, energy is re-routed from the tassel to the ear and the number of tassel branches decreases, potentially leading to a shortage of pollen during the season. Sorghum's flowering structure, or panicle, is highly drought-resistant and sorghum has therefore been studied as an ideal crop for drier regions of the U.S. This project aims to understand genome-wide responses to drought in corn tassels and sorghum panicles, providing molecular information for breeding better plant performance during drought. Broader impacts include the formation of undergraduate outreach programs promoting STEM majors, research, and career opportunities to increase participation and retention of LGBT undergraduate students in STEM academic and professional fields. Students will be surveyed over time and long-term management of the programs will be transferred to campus advocacy groups, providing an outreach model for campuses nationwide. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, biological modeling, and molecular genetics. <br/><br/>Although previous studies have elucidated gene regulatory networks (GRNs) responsible for tassel branching in maize, little is known about how tassel GRNs respond to abiotic stresses, such as drought. Whereas several maize GRNs are conserved in other grasses, sorghum panicle GRNs have not been established. Using drought to manipulate tassel/panicle morphology, this project will explore GRN-wide drought response in maize and sorghum, including known mutants of tassel/panicle morphology. This research will use RNAseq to analyze inflorescence tissue from several different drought simulations. Leveraging existing GRN and genome resources in maize and sorghum, this project will generate and compare dynamic, drought responsive tassel/panicle GRNs. With these GRNs, morphological models linking RNA levels to tassel/panicle branching will be constructed. To test morphological-GRN models, this project will generate and analyze novel tassel/panicle mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. Research findings and analysis methodologies will be disseminated through conferences, publications, and submissions to data/code repositories (NCBI-SRA, NCBI-GEO, GitHub, MaizeGDB, and Grassius).<br/><br/>Keywords: abiotic stress, co-expression networks, drought, inflorescence biology, maize genetics"

Although much has been learned about the consequences of genome doubling in recent years, many fundamental questions remain regarding how genome duplication contributes to plant biology and crop productivity. An important dimension of genome duplication is how the now-doubled nuclear genome interacts with other genomic compartments found within the plant cell, such as the mitochondria and plastids. The planned research will investigate this underexplored aspect of genome duplications, with implications for how cellular energetics, which play a key role in growth, reproduction, and yield, are altered in the wake of genome doubling events. The research will use a diverse panel of important crop systems and state-of-the-art genomics techniques. Project resources, data, and personnel will be used to expand outreach and education programs, including an international workshop series on genomics and a long-term effort to provide high school teachers with an immersive experience in hands-on research and curricular development. The project will create training opportunities for participants across the full range of educational and career stages in both research and service-learning. In sum, this research aims to provide fundamental insights into genome interactions and crop biology and broaden participation in plant biological research.<br/><br/>Allopolyploidy events entail the simultaneous merger of genomes from two divergent lineages combined with the doubling of nuclear genome content. Because cytoplasmic genomes are typically inherited from only a single (maternal) parent, allopolyploidization is expected to have complex effects on the relative copy number (i.e., stoichiometry) of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, and also create novel, ""untested"" pairings of nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes. The planned research will reveal the spectrum of genomic responses that alleviate the disruptive effects of allopolyploidy on cytonuclear interactions and facilitate the successful establishment of hybrid/polyploid lineages. Bioinformatic analyses will test for predicted compensatory responses in organelle-targeted nuclear genes that resolve maladapted interactions between the paternally derived nuclear subgenome and maternally derived cytoplasmic genomes, including: (1) maternally biased gene conversion; (2) altered selection pressures on sequence evolution in the paternal subgenome; (3) paternally biased pseudogenization and gene loss; and (4) preferential down-regulation of paternal homoeologs. By taking advantage of >600 re-sequenced genomes from cotton allopolyploids, the proposed research will be extended to the population-genomic level to detect these effects ""in action"". Finally, the relative copy number of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic genomes and the relative expression levels in the nucleus, mitochondria, and plastids will be precisely quantified to differentiate among multiple hypothesized responses to stoichiometric imbalance.

Broader impacts include mentoring of students, guest lecturing, and outreach events exploring the connections between food systems and crop domestication. <br/><br/>There is need to expand domestication research beyond the cereals to additional crops with global and nutritional importance. In this project, the fellow will study domestication and demographic history in B. oleracea by testing for genomic signatures of selection, characterizing previous bottlenecks and expansions, studying trade-offs in amino acid metabolism between leaves and seeds, and identifying genomic regions of interest for these traits. This will include the resequencing of a diversity panel of B. oleracea, network analysis of amino acid composition in leaves and seeds, quantitative assessment of leaf morphology, and identification of the structural variation contributing to the observed phenotypes. All data, scripts, and methodologies produced from this work will be deposited in open-access repositories."

Outcrossing maintains genetic variation and is essential for hybrid seed production. Crop production however is often facilitated by a combination of self- and cross-pollination. Thus, the ability of plant breeders to generate plants that preferentially self- or cross-pollinate is extremely useful, but currently limited to a small number of crops. Two related crops, lettuce and sunflower, have very similar floral anatomy. Despite these similarities, lettuce is exclusively self-pollinating, while sunflower depends upon cross-pollination by insects. Using lettuce and sunflowers as models, a diverse team of researcher (UC Davis: PI Harmer; UC Berkeley: co-PI Blackman; Iowa State: co-PI Barb) investigate how internal and external factors interact to generate these distinct reproductive strategies in lettuce and sunflower.  Specifically, the investigators use genomic, physiological, and quantitative genetic approaches to better understand how the precise timing of late stage floral development promotes self- or cross-pollination. A better understanding of the regulation of these processes is likely to lead to new approaches to modify the frequency of self- and cross-pollination in crop species, providing important new tools for breeders. Given the anticipated challenges of future climates and observed declines in both wild and managed pollinator populations, a better understanding of the traits underlying plant mating strategies and their modulation by environmental factors is key to future agronomic improvements and global food security. The proposed research also provides interdisciplinary training for the next generation of scientists to thrive in an era of highly integrative research.<br/> <br/>Protandry, the condition in which a single flower is first male and then female, is a reproductive strategy that promotes out-crossing in many plant species including cultivated sunflower. Preliminary data has shown that protandry is regulated both by the circadian clock and the environment. In lettuce, which is almost entirely self-pollinating, floret morphology is similar to cultivated sunflower, but the male and female phases occur simultaneously. These two crops, sunflower and lettuce will be used as models to define how environmental and internal cues direct floral organ growth to promote out-crossing or self-pollination. Comparative transcriptomic studies are used to identify pathways controlling the timing of late-stage floral development. The team uses quantitative genomic studies  to uncover the underlying architecture of the genetic variation that affects floret maturation and discern its impact on self- and cross-pollination. Open field and pollinator cage studies are used to assess the importance of the timing of late floral development (anthesis) relative to other floral traits in the reproductive strategies of out-crossing versus selfing. These studies highlight targets for improving yield under suboptimal pollinator activity and may facilitate development of inbred lines that are more attractive to pollinators, potentially leading to substantial cost savings by hybrid seed producers. High school students, undergraduates, and community volunteers contribute to discovery-based research in the classroom, lab, field, and at the UC Botanical Garden. Undergraduate interns are recruited from programs that connect underrepresented groups in STEM fields with researchers. These efforts also provide excellent teaching opportunities for postdoctoral scholars and graduate students supported by the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Texas at Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tom Juenger.<br/><br/>Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most consumed source of plant protein worldwide and is a particularly important source of protein in the developing world. A question of pressing importance is how important crop traits, such as protein or yield, were influenced by interaction of genes with the environment, so called GXE interactions. Common bean was domesticated to grow in a wide variety of environments and is thus an excellent candidate to explore how crop traits are determined by GXE interactions. An extensive dataset of over 500 common bean varieties grown at 36 locations across the United States over 34 years links bean traits in different environments. This research project leverages these historical datasets and will document genetic variation in common bean, thus providing an exciting opportunity to connect the traits to their genetic drivers. Undergraduate students will be trained in cutting edge genomic analysis and the public will learn about plant genomics through outreach activities with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.<br/><br/>This project combines experiments and computational analyses to determine the interactions of GXE on yield variation and other traits of common bean. New association mapping populations will be produced, and these will be directly connected to historically robust datasets containing phenotype and yield data for common bean. The genetics of yield variation will be determined through genome-wide association approaches, both for regions with genomic variation between varieties and genomic regions fixed by local adaptation between bean races. The project will test for differential expression and physiology between varieties with and without GxE in response to specific climate drivers."

Understanding the genetic basis of crop performance in variable environments is imperative, but long-term studies translating genotype to phenotype are exceedingly rare. To fill this gap, the genetic basis of local adaptation will be explored in a near century long agricultural experiment, the barley composite cross II (CCII). The CCII was initiated in the 1920's and has been allowed to adapt to the local conditions in Davis, CA for over 50 generations. With this unique resource, cutting edge high-throughput phenotype and genotype characterization methods will be employed to elucidate the genetic basis of agricultural performance.  The ultimate goal of this study is to predict successful genotypes in variable environmental conditions. Thriving during climatic extremes will minimize potential food insecurity arising from environmental factors.<br/><br/> This project will focus on the characterization of 1000 individuals drawn from four time points in the CCII experiment to elucidate the effect of local selective pressures on phenotype and genotype. Phenotypic data will be collected at three resolutions: single time point measurements of whole plant and inflorescence traits, temporal growth rate measurements using webcam monitoring, and inflorescence 3D renderings using CT scanning. Using a combination of genome-wide SNP discovery and ascertainment strategies, adaptive shifts in phenotype will be linked to specific genetic changes. The results of this project will be shared with the general public through multiple outreach programs, increasing the understanding of how crops adapt to changing environments."

Maize production has experienced dramatic yield increases over the last century but faces challenges for further increases, particularly under highly variable climates and disease pressures. Revolutionary genome engineering tools (genome editing) offer great opportunities for improved understanding of the relationship between genetic information and traits, and for modifying genetic features for trait improvements. Unfortunately, most crop plants, including maize, are not readily amenable to plant tissue culture, thereby limiting the benefit from direct applications of genome editing tools. In this project, the genome of a maize line amenable to culture will be sequenced to facilitate the identification of the genetic elements that regulate culturability. Novel approaches will be developed for genetic decoding on the complex maize genome. In particular, a designable bacterial system specifically interacting with genes of interest in the maize genome will be utilized to study gene function and manipulate cell development. The project will also provide training for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in both genetics and computation, with an emphasis on large data education. In addition, the project will collaborate with the Kansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation to encourage involvement of historically underrepresented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Maize is the highest agronomically valued crop in the US. Genome engineering tools, including TALENs and CRISPRs, provide great potential for the elucidation of maize gene functions and trait improvements.  However, current genetic and genomic resources as well as transformation capacity in maize are insufficient for the full utilization of genome engineering tools. This project provides public resources that include a high-quality genome assembly of a highly transformation amenable maize inbred line, A188, and 150 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross of A188 with B73, a transformation recalcitrant inbred variety and the maize reference genome. Bulked RNA sequencing based mapping will be used for genetic mapping of traits related to embryogenesis and regeneration. Furthermore, the project will generate time-series transcriptome profiles from callus cells that are transiently expressing designer Transcription Activator-Like effectors (dTALes) of a known regulator of embryogenesis and regeneration.  These profiles will be used to construct multilayered hierarchical gene regulatory networks to identify high hierarchical regulators and hub genes that govern maize embryogenesis and regeneration. Ectopic gene expression and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will be used to validate select candidate genes. These genetic and genomic resources will advance genome engineering in a major crop species and improve understanding of the genetic basis of maize transformation and regeneration ability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Boyce Thompson Institute and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Georg Jander and Lukas Mueller.<br/><br/>To protect themselves against insect herbivores, plants have evolved a wide variety of chemical defenses. One class of plant defensive metabolites, known as cardiac glycosides, is found in at least twelve plant families and works by slowing the contractions and increasing the pumping force of the predator's heart. Despite the therapeutic use of these compounds in treating arrhythmias and congestive heart failure, a complete pathway for cardiac glycoside biosynthesis is not known for any plant species. This project will use the cardiac glycoside-producing wormseed wallflower (Erysimum cheiranthoides) to identify the biosynthetic pathway genes for these compounds. These results will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of defensive chemicals in other plant species, including important crops such as maize, soybean, and wheat. Training objectives include metabolomics, genetics, gene expression technologies and bioinformatics.  Broader impacts include introducing underrepresented students to genomics and chemical ecology research via mentoring through an NSF-funded REU program, outreach to high school students at an urban high school in Yonkers (NY) and the development of laboratory kits for middle- and high-school teachers in rural New York.<br/><br/>As a rapidly-growing, self-pollinating annual, E. cheiranthoides is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of a new metabolic pathway for the production of cardenolides, a class of cardiac glycosides involved in herbivore defense. Modification of ubiquitous biosynthetic pathways of endogenous plant steroids, e.g. brassinosteroids, has likely been repeatedly selected for in the course of evolution to generate similar anti-herbivore toxins. This research will identify expansion and neofunctionalization of the enzyme families in E. cheiranthoides that normally contribute to primary metabolism in other crucifer species. Erysimum homologs of known cardenolide biosynthetic genes from other species will be identified using genome assemblies and characterized using structure-function-sequence analysis. Missing genes in the cardenolide pathway will be discovered through comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and forward genetic screens. Finally, the ecological ""escape from herbivory"" hypothesis will be tested by examining the role of cardenolides in host-insect interactions. Results from this research will be shared through publications, presentations at conferences, and inclusion in www.erysimum.org, a wallflower-specific website which will serve as a publicly accessible repository for all data related to this project.<br/><br/>Keywords: biosynthesis biochemistry, plant biotic stress, comparative genomics<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phytochromes are proteins that change activity when exposed to light, and, in turn, light-activated phytochromes direct many changes in plant cells, including massive re-programming of which genes are being turned on and which are being kept off. For example, phytochromes enable plants to detect nearby vegetation through subtle shifts in the quality of light hitting the plant cell. This light-activated surveillance mechanism initiates changes in plant architecture, biomass formation and the timing of reproduction, all traits that are strongly linked to crop yield. These changes in growth strategy require corresponding adjustments in resource deployment and yet little is known about how this is accomplished. This project will start to fill in this critical knowledge gap that will lead to new ideas for improving crop performance.  With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide international research training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, the project will extend existing outreach efforts to include a yearly 12-week residency for a visual artist to develop new visualization tools for molecular genetic concepts, particularly those relating to agriculture and biofuels. <br/><br/>This project builds on new research from the partner labs showing that cross talk between phytochrome and carbon signaling is central to C resource use efficiency and resource conservation. A principal aim will be to determine the role of phytochrome in C resource management. The project will also delineate the genetic basis and impact of shading-induced N re-allocation in canopies. This trait strongly impacts on N use efficiency and stand photosynthesis, and in many crops is closely linked to yield. The project will conduct a systematic study across scales, delivering mechanistic information about signal integration, time-resolved transcriptome and metabolite profiles, and quantitative information about biomass accumulation, defined as the flux of carbon to protein and cell wall components, and growth dynamics. The experimental findings will be integrated into models to test hypotheses and to gain understanding at a system level. An aim will be to build models that predict the dual action of phytochrome and photosynthesis on resource management and biomass production. The project will run parallel work programs in the reference species, Arabidopsis thaliana, and the closely related crop Brassica rapa. The rapid life cycle and larger resource pool of the reference species will accelerate knowledge acquisition. B. rapa brings the advantage of larger size, and allows new insights to be directly applied to a food crop.  Results will be made broadly accessible through national and international meetings and through publications in leading international journals. All datasets will be accessible through the consortium website, as well as through long-term repositories that include but are not limited to the Biological Data Repository (BioDare; https://www.biodare.ed.ac.uk/) and the Plant Systems Biology Modelling (PlaSMo;http://www.plasmo.ed.ac.uk/) database.

Pathogens that survive this first line of defense are met by a second line of defense that results in a higher amplitude programmed cell death response, which effectively sequesters some pathogens in foci of dead cells. However, in the case of necrotrophic pathogens, the class of plant pathogens that acquire nutrients from dead tissue, this defense response is hijacked and utilized by the pathogen to further disease proliferation, translating to crop failure. The project will fill knowledge gaps in the understanding of how plants perceive this important class of pathogens and how immunity responses result in a positive outcome for the plant host (disease resistance). Thus, the project will contribute to understanding of how plant immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens which is important as they are becoming well known for their roles in causing disease on important crops and are significantly contributing to world food security issues. The information generated will transect multiple pathosystems important to crop production through characterizing and defining the mechanism that regulates host signaling and immunity against diverse pathogens. The molecular genetic and genomic data generated and molecular tools developed, will broadly benefit the plant-microbe interactions scientific community as well as answer fundamental questions that will facilitate the deployment of genetic resistance in crops contributing to a more secure food supply. This research will also be used in cross-disciplinary training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students in molecular genetics and molecular plant pathology from both the host and pathogen perspective. A collaborative outreach program developed through this grant will involve education of young Native American scientists in order to effectively recruit them into the scientific fields effectively broadening the participation of the most under represented group in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis is that early immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens, yet later elicited immunity responses result in programmed cell death that is effectively hijacked by the necrotophic specialists to complete their lifecycle, contributing to disease susceptibility. The two specific objectives to test this hypothesis focus on a comprehensive evaluation of the temporally and spatially distinct immunity and virulence responses from the host (barley) and pathogen (Pyrenophora teres f. teres), respectively. These aims will address fundamental questions: 1) is a diverse receptor-like protein targeted by multiple necrotrophic effectors to elicit necrotrophic effector triggered susceptibility (NETS); and 2) does a highly effective dominant resistance gene activate early defense responses, arresting the necrotrophic specialist before it colonizes and deploys its necrotrophic effector repertoire? The first component of the plant immune system investigated is a highly variable receptor-like protein, Spt1, which is targeted by multiple diverse necrotrophic effectors located throughout the genomes which evolved to incite disease. This receptor contains unprecedented variability at a localized region that correlates with specific susceptibilities, suggesting that the pathogen populations continually evolved to target this unknown domain and the host has been undergoing a high level of diversifying selection at this domain to evade pathogen virulence. The information gathered on the receptor and necrotrophic effectors will fill fundamental gaps in the knowledge of how necrotrophic specialists target the host and manipulate a weak link in its immune system to cause disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many plant species, particularly those adapted to temperate climates, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in day-length and temperature. The objective of the research is to further the understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that control the timing of flowering in response to seasonal cues in grasses, a group of plants that includes many important crops such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn. Much of the research will utilize the model grass Brachypodium distachyon because working in this species facilitates identifying the genes underlying flowering in response to seasonal cues. The data generated will help to lay the groundwork for tailoring the flowering of crop species, and will advance the basic understanding of how organisms have evolved systems to perceive environmental cues and translate those cues into developmental programs such as the initiation of flowering. This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs, and provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology, and plant development while exploring their interests in a STEM career. The project will also involve development of a classroom module to provide K-12 students with an opportunity to explore how plants grow and develop and respond to seasonal signals such as the cold of winter.<br/><br/>A major goal is to advance the understanding of how perception of winter cold as well as the short days of winter are translated into stable, epigenetic changes in gene expression that enable grasses that are adapted to temperate climates to become competent to flower in the spring when conditions are most favorable for reproduction. The process is known as vernalization. The project will involve studying certain recently discovered key genes involved in both cold-mediated and short-day-mediated flowering in grasses. These genes had not previously been known to play a role in flowering. One group of genes encodes proteins that may be part of a novel, plant-specific gene regulatory complex; another represents a new role for a member of the florigen gene family. A combination of genetics and biochemistry will be employed to explore the role of the proteins encoded by these genes with the goal of better understanding the molecular basis of how flowering is regulated in response to seasonal cues in grasses. The flowering pathways under study evolved independently in different groups of plants; thus, this research is also a model for studying how convergent evolutionary pathways can lead to a solution to the common problem of ensuring that flowering only occurs after winter has ended.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to advancing knowledge of leptin biology and control of metabolism in vertebrates, the project will incorporate graduate, undergraduate and high school students in research activities with a focus on developing an understanding of experimental designs, whole animal physiology, molecular and cell biology and endocrinology. The Principal Investigator will also work with the Science House at NCSU, and the NC Mathematics and Science Education Network Pre-College Program, to enhance K-12 STEM education and the recruitment of under-represented students into life sciences programs. A second outreach component will be provided through the Nature Research Center at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences (Daily Planet Broadcast) to develop teaching modules to foster greater public interest in science and the biology of fishes.

The use of chemicals and pesticides to control plant diseases risks collateral damage to the environment and human health. Therefore it is important to understand how plants fight against pathogens and subsequently to use such information to control plant resistance to devastating diseases. Upon frequent challenges imposed by pathogens, plants activate different defense responses at different times of a day, a process recently shown to be controlled by the endogenous biological timekeeper called the circadian clock. The circadian clock integrates temporal information with environmental stimuli (such as pathogen infections) to regulate many biological processes, including plant defense responses. The investigators previously demonstrated that changes in plant defense status could affect clock activity. However how defense responses and clock activity are co-regulated in plants remains unclear. This project seeks insights into the mechanisms that coordinate the circadian clock with defense responses. Importantly, this project provides excellent training opportunities to students, especially women, underrepresented minority students and K-12 science teachers. Students and postdocs involved in this project will be broadly trained in biology and bioinformatics so as to be better prepared for future careers in science. Research experiences will also be provided to K-12 teachers from low performing public schools in the Baltimore area. Science teachers are the key to making connections between knowledge acquired in the classroom and research conducted in the laboratory. The research experience that will be provided will enable them to design a more effective science curriculum for their classes.<br/><br/>The goal of this collaborative project is to understand the interplay between the controls of innate immunity and the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Specifically the project seeks to identify and characterize genes that control defense and/or clock activities and elucidate how these genes act together to orchestrate disease resistance, growth, and development of Arabidopsis. To address this goal, a team of experts in plant defense, circadian clock, and systems biology fields will employ traditional molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches as well as computational modeling to implement the proposed activities. Information obtained from this study will enhance our fundamental knowledge about disease resistance, growth and development of plants.

Such plants will reduce our dependency on chemicals and pesticides, thus protecting the environment and human health and supporting sustainable agriculture."

All these may lead to the decline and extinction of local populations that live in these fragmented habitats. Organisms in general have finite amounts of resources (nutritional energy) to invest in growth, maintenance, dispersal and reproduction. Allocation of resources to any one of these functions reduces the amount available to the others. This study will test the hypothesis that a tradeoff in the amount of resources allocated to dispersal versus resources allocated to reproduction serves as the physiological mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variability experienced in fragmented habitats into population persistence within those habitats. This study will test this hypothesis using a fast-moving ground-dwelling beetle in the fragmented habitat of the Southern Judean Lowlands in Israel. Through the outreach program Insect Discovery, about 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ will use insects to learn biological principles in specially designed workshops and classroom visits. In addition, 66 undergraduate preceptors and 12 graduate students will be trained in science outreach and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. <br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is a dominant feature of landscapes particularly where intensive cultivation results in increased fragmentation of natural habitats. A novel, integrative conceptual framework is proposed in which spatial characteristics of the environment, imposed by fragmentation, lead to specific life-history traits that increase individual survival and decrease the likelihood of population extinction. As habitat fragmentation increases, organisms should invest more into dispersal and less into reproduction, resulting in a resource allocation tradeoff between reproduction and dispersal along a habitat fragmentation gradient. Emerging from this are three explicit and testable hypotheses that predict that the dispersal-reproduction tradeoff is the mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variation created by habitat fragmentation into variation in species abundances that lower local extinction probability and increase population persistence. These hypotheses will be tested in a well-studied fragmented landscape in the Southern Judea Lowlands of Israel, focusing on a fast-moving, ground-dwelling beetle. This study brings together techniques from landscape ecology and ecological physiology across multiple scales, from the individual, to patches, to populations, to whole landscapes. This project will support Insect Discovery, an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principles to nearly 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ, most of whom are economically disadvantaged, underserved minorities.

Past work in this field has emphasized the direct physiological stress of extreme temperatures, but it is unclear if such extreme conditions limit species in the wild.  Alternately, animals may simply lack enough energy to defend against thermal extremes that they could otherwise tolerate.  This work has three main objectives:  1) to extend an existing modeling approach in physiology (Dynamic Energy Budget) for use with intertidal species, which alternate daily between marine and terrestrial conditions, 2) to use the model, in conjunction with field experiments, to test the hypothesis that energy limitation, rather than direct thermal stress, limits the success of B. glandula in the wild; and, 3) to use field and laboratory measurements to explore how thermal tolerance and success differ between barnacle populations from California and Washington.  Altogether, these projects will improve our understanding of the thermal physiology of B. glandula, specifically, and of the role of energy limitation in thermal stress, more generally.<br/><br/>The integrated education plan of this CAREER grant contains three specific objectives:  1) to use research opportunities to attract and retain students in biology majors, 2) to improve the retention and performance of women and minority undergraduates in an introductory biology course, and 3) to improve the understanding of science by the general college population. The grant activities will include: generating new research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students, the piloting of a research experience program for sophomore-level students, the establishment of a peer-study program for students in an introductory biology course, and the development of a new course for non-science majors that emphasizes scientific literacy.  The educational effectiveness of these programs will be rigorously tested and the results will inform the future teaching activities of the PI, her department, and the greater academic science community. The broader impacts of this CAREER grant will be 1) broadening the participation of women and under-represented minorities in science, 2) improving biology education and the educational skills of the PI, 3) increasing public scientific literacy, and 4) informing our understanding of the biological consequences of global climate change, a critical societal need."

Research by the PI over the last decade reveals that the feet of running lizards are surprisingly multi-functional and that the relationship between foot-surface dynamics and the control of movement are more complicated than currently appreciated. This award will support studies to explore how kinematics and passive properties of the feet affect interactions with the ground when running across a range of materials. The research will generate fundamental knowledge about the role of active and passive control mechanisms in tuning foot-substrate interactions on complex media. The outcome of the studies will impact the way researchers view the role of the feet during legged locomotion. This research provides an excellent starting-point from which to engage children and the public in complex concepts that integrate biology, physics, and materials sciences. The educational objective of this award is to increase engagement of middle school students in science through the development and dissemination of research-driven curricula based on results from the proposed research studies, and by training current and future science teachers in inquiry-based pedagogical techniques. Finally, the research findings from these studies will have impacts reaching beyond biology, including the design and actuation of mobile robotics and robust prosthetic design.<br/><br/>The research objective of this award is to determine how foot morphology and impact kinematics affect foot-ground interactions. Specifically, the studies will: (1) characterize the kinematic patterns associated with running across different surface types; (2) quantify the patterns of foot-ground interactions in complex media; and (3) determine how changes in foot flexibility, geometry, and kinematics affect foot-ground interactions. By using a combination of biological and physical experimental techniques, the results from these studies will address general principles of foot intrusion dynamics that are broadly applicable across diverse taxa. Consequently, our findings will stimulate research that explores the evolutionary basis of foot morphology conservation and diversification, and the dynamics of foot-surface interactions, linking biology with materials science.

Flexibility could facilitate evolution by creating new traits on which selection could act; alternatively, flexibility could hamper evolution by protecting genes for detrimental traits from being selected. Flexibility in mating behavior can be especially important because it could allow the maintenance of small or isolated populations, where available mates of preferred types are few, or play a role in the divergence of populations, ultimately leading to divergence of one species into two or more. This project addresses this fundamental question by examining how flexibility in mate preference could affect the evolution of courtship. During this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate participant will gain comprehensive research experience in behavioral ecology and bioacoustics. In addition, the researchers will engage in science education and outreach activities aimed at elementary school children, adults in non-science careers, and members of underrepresented groups in science via hands-on science activities, public appearances, and writing for non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This project examines how the experience of male song quality during development affects female mating behavior in the Pacific field cricket. Male crickets produce song that females use to identify and localize appropriate mates. Within Hawaii, the crickets experience a novel selection pressure against singing preferred songs: an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly that preferentially infests males with the same song characteristics preferred by female crickets. Recently, a mutation arose that makes male crickets obligately silent ('flatwing'). Female crickets strongly prefer singing males, and also have directional preferences about temporal properties of the song. Plasticity in expression of these preferences could facilitate maintenance of this population when available males of preferred phenotypes are few, but this plasticity could have consequences for the strength of selection on sexual signals. Indeed, both males and females reared in silence, mimicking an all-mutant environment, become more phonotactic, suggesting that mating behavior is plastic and selection on signals in nature may be relaxed. In this study, the researchers will rear crickets in acoustic environments that vary by the value of a preferred trait and use phonotaxis trials (females) and song recordings (males) to determine: 1) whether signal production is plastic; 2) whether expression of female mating preferences is plastic; 3) whether population differences in the extent of this plasticity support the hypothesis that plasticity in mating behavior is an adaptive response following the introduction of flatwing."

However, they are at risk of demise from ongoing and impending environmental stressors and disease-causing agents. There is a need to understand the mechanisms of resistance to pathogenic stressors by corals if we are to influence the persistence of coral reefs under current challenges. Here a research program will elucidate the specificity, memory and molecular basis of the defense response of corals upon repetitive encounters with pathogens. Understanding how the immune system of these organisms responds to pathogens may offer insights into the resilience of these ecosystems, and potentially may inform remediation of them. One clear implication would be the development of immunization protocols to improve tolerance and survival of corals and their relatives. The proposed research will increase and potentially transform our understanding of the dynamic immunological response of these basal animals, which remains grossly understudied despite the ecological and economic importance of coral reefs. Furthermore, the project will build science capacity through the training and education of the next generation of American and international young scientists. The lead investigator will develop research and educational projects to support K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students within the integrated scope of the project.  A strong emphasis will be placed on developing outreach programs for Hispanic high school students and other minority students from the Miami metropolitan area with the goal of generating interest in science education and facilitating growth in the recruitment and participation of these underrepresented groups in undergraduate fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. An important aspect of this educational project is the synergy between the research laboratory of an early-career scientist, a well-established Hispanic Serving Institution (Florida International University) and the local public school system in Miami-Dade County, all joined in the mission to stimulate interest in science careers through exposure to inspired teaching. <br/><br/>Coral diseases are of great concern since they have emerged over recent decades as a significant threat to coral reef ecosystems.

The Principal Investigator will elucidate the role of immune priming in the response of anthozoans upon repetitive encounters to infectious agents. The approach uses the sea anemone model Exaiptasia pallida to determine whether the immune system of this organism exhibits specific memory in response to infectious agents, as indicated by accelerated defensive responses upon subsequent exposures to pathogens, a phenomenon that remains largely unknown in basal metazoans. This research also investigates the lasting effect of induced protective response upon multiple repetitive pathogenic encounters. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiles and histological approaches will be used to facilitate the discovery of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the phenomenon of immune priming."

Jasmonate (JA) is the plant hormone that orchestrates these defense responses and dictates an inhibition of growth for plants under stress conditions. JA is also a powerful inducer of many specialized metabolites that have important ecological functions. These metabolites are also a renewable source of many high-value natural products for human use such as nutraceuticals. This project will elucidate how JA levels are precisely regulated to accommodate the various stress adaptive mechanisms of plants. The long term goal of this research is to help reduce or eliminate the need for chemical pesticides and to increase global food production through new approaches to pest control. This research promotes a better understanding of plant defense mechanisms, which can benefit both farmers and horticulturists. This project seeks to improve STEM education by providing multidisciplinary training to college students, graduates and postgraduates. Students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science will be sought through participation in the scientist's institutional outreach programs set up for that purpose. A science literacy program called Sci-LiFT (Science Literacy for Future Teachers) will be developed for students who are in training to become secondary school science teachers. Participating students will engage in real laboratory research on topics relevant to this project and develop a high school teaching module. The Sci-LiFT program is expected to leave an indelible mark on program participants and will positively impact their future teaching in secondary schools. <br/><br/>Although the core JA biosynthetic pathway has been delineated, how JA biosynthesis is initiated, maintained, or terminated is unclear. The major scientific goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the termination of JA signal and to investigate its role in plant responses to wounding. Mutants were isolated that are defective in JA catabolism, and as a result, overaccumulate JA. Highly elevated JA concentration in these mutants was expected to constitutively activate JA-mediated defense responses. Contrary to this expectation, the mutants displayed opposite symptoms, becoming desensitized to JA, thus revealing an important link between JA catabolism and the plant?s long-term responses to stress conditions. This project will use a variety of mutants that are altered in endogenous JA profiles to investigate the dynamic relationship between the relative levels of JA derivatives and plant response to wounding in a well-established Arabidopsis genetic system. The specific aims of this project are: i) to determine the roles of JA turnover and oxidized-JA derivatives in plant response to wounding, ii) to delineate the signaling pathways important for wound response in JA catabolic mutants, and iii) to characterize the function of a new gene identified through a mutant screen for JA catabolism. The proposed project has the potential to identify previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of JA signaling and JA-dependent wound responses. This project is also expected to provide new information about how plants prioritize growth versus defense by studying the mutants that appear to defy the growth-defense-tradeoff rule."

Understanding and eventually manipulating for crop improvement the key molecular mechanisms which plants use to defend against various pathogens is thus of considerable agricultural, economic, and social importance. Among the mechanisms pivotal for host defense is ubiquitination, a major post-translational protein modification process that occurs in plant, animal, and human cells. A particular type of unconventional modification of proteins by ubiquitin (lysine-63-linked ubiquitination, is well documented to be crucial in modulating human and animal innate and adaptive immunity. However, the roles of this type of ubiquitination in plant immunity and other plant physiological processes have been significantly understudied, even though this type of ubiquitnation is the second most abundant type of ubiquitination in plants. This project investigates the mechanistic basis of regulating plant innate immunity by this type of unconventional ubiquitination and includes education development for high school science teachers and minority undergraduate students and outreach to the Nebraska farmers and stakeholders.<br/><br/>Initial work of this project has identified and preliminarily implicated two tomato RING type ubiquitin ligases, Fti1 and Fti1B and their closest homolog in Arabidopsis, AtFti1 and AtFti1B, respectively in FLS2-mediated plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Fti1 and Fti1B and their Arabidopsis closest homolog were found to interact and work with UBC13 type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination and Fti1B and AtFti1B were shown to be functionally conserved in FLS2-mediated PTI.  Additionally, an isoform of AtFti1B was found to change subcellular localization to a yet undetermined organelle after PTI was induced by flg22 in the cell. In this project the investigators will elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of plant PTI by AtFti1B/Fti1B-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination, with aims to (1) determine the role of AtFti1B isoforms in PTI and the molecular outcome of AtFti1B-BAK1/FLS2 interaction; (2) elucidate the biological significance of AtFti1B-BAK1/FLS2 interaction, the E3 ligase activity of AtFti1B, and the AtFti1B subcellular localization in plant immunity; and (3) identify novel components that are involved in the regulation of plant immunity by AtFti1B-mediated Lys63 ubiquitination. Fulfillment of this project will help integrally address two important, yet elusive questions in plant immunity: what are the roles and mechanisms of Lys63-linked ubiquitination and cell organelles in plant immune signaling. Considering the limited knowledge of Lys63-linked ubiquitination in plant biology in general, findings from this project will also assist our efforts to understand Lys63-linked ubiquitination in other plant physiological processes. Integral to this project will be extensive education and outreach activities to train high school science teachers and minority undergraduate students that are underrepresented in science through a High School and Undergraduate Science Connect Promoting Keen Interests in Research (HUSKER) program and to educate Nebraska farmers and stakeholders about the importance of basic research in crop improvement."

How the brain detects the violation of expectations and processes it to support learning and memory is unclear but is thought to involve several brain regions, prominent among which is the cerebellum. The cerebellum is known to regulate learning of fine movements and motor coordination, and its role in non-motor functions is only now beginning to be appreciated. The investigators in this project will determine the contribution of the cerebellum to emotional learning and memory. Specifically, the investigators are examining whether communication between the cerebellum and emotion-regulating brain circuits is necessary during learning and/or recollection of threat-related emotional memories. By using novel technologies, the investigators selectively and reversibly interfere with this communication in a spatially and temporally precise manner and can thus determine its functional significance. The knowledge gained from this investigation will inform understanding of cerebellar function and of the neurobiology of emotion, with implications for neurodevelopmental and post-traumatic stress disorders. The investigators also capitalize on the fact that formation of emotional memories is a fascinating topic to which people with diverse backgrounds can readily relate and are i) mentoring undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM in laboratory research; ii) continuing and expanding a public outreach initiative, which brings the latest brain science achievements to the general public and engages UC Davis trainees in public speaking to non-specialists; iii) disseminating information about brain science and research career choices to Hispanic communities locally and world-wide; and iv) are developing workshops for K-12 educators, to help further their science background and recommend ways to incorporate brain science in educational curricula.<br/><br/>There is growing appreciation for the modulatory role of the cerebellum in social and affective behaviors, in addition to its established role in motor control. However, the mechanistic link between the cerebellum and emotional learning and memory is lacking. Functional connections exist between the cerebellum and the amygdala, raising the exciting possibility that a cerebello-amygdala circuit processes information important for emotional learning and memory. The overarching objective of this proposal is to understand the role of the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and amygdala-based emotional circuits in learned emotion.  The investigators hypothesize that the cerebellum causally contributes to threat-related emotional learning and memory through projections to emotional circuits. They are testing this hypothesis at the microcircuit and synaptic levels through a multifaceted approach, which leverages the spatiotemporal resolution of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools to dissociate motor from non-motor effects. The expectation is that if communication between the cerebellum and specific emotional centers is necessary for learned emotion, then inhibition of cerebellar projections should impair aspects of learned emotion. The project is conceptually innovative because it assigns for the first time emotional functionality to cerebellar projections that are well-conserved across mammals but have received little attention to-date. It is also technically innovative because it employs for the first time an approach to the study of the cerebellum and learned emotion that minimizes compensatory effects and enables the separation of motor from non-motor contributions. The potential exists to break new ground in the understanding of cerebellar function and of the neurobiology of emotion. Finally, the project is of broad interest as it offers deep insights into principles of motivated behavior and sheds light into the role of traditionally-considered motor areas in non-motor functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mammals, serotonin can also cause the constriction of blood vessels, altering blood flow to organs throughout the body. Mammalian serotonin transporters in blood platelets remove serotonin from the blood plasma, thereby controlling serotonin's effect on blood vessels. In fishes as in mammals, serotonin levels within the blood plasma are low and elevation of circulating serotonin results in the constriction of blood vessels. However, in contrast to mammals, significant levels of serotonin have not been found within fish blood cells and it is not known how circulating serotonin levels are regulated in fish. This project will fill that gap by characterizing the serotonin transporter's role in controlling circulating levels of serotonin, and thus blood pressure and flow, in fish. Fish will be tested in water with normal oxygen levels, and in low-oxygen conditions when controlling blood flow to active tissues and organs such as the gills is most important. It is expected that this project will reveal the role of serotonin and the serotonin transporter in the control of blood pressure and flow in fish, contributing significantly to the field of cardiovascular physiology. Results may also help to answer existing questions about serotonin's role in blood flow control in mammals. The project will educate and expose underrepresented youth to science, enhance the participation of women and minorities in science, and strengthen collaborative partnerships. <br/><br/>The role of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in controlling circulating levels of serotonin (or hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and, consequently, vascular resistance, in the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) will be determined under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Three questions will be addressed: (1) What are the tissue distribution, transport kinetics, and pharmacological sensitivity of a teleost SERT compared to SERT of other vertebrates? (2) What is the role of systemic SERT in the control of circulating 5-HT? (3) What is the role of branchial SERT in the control of circulating 5-HT? The answers to these questions will support the central hypothesis that SERT plays an integral role in controlling circulating 5-HT and, as a result, vascular resistance, blood pressure, and blood flow in teleost fish. Advanced techniques, including fluorescent neurotransmitter imaging probes, will be applied to investigate SERT function at the cellular level. The research will reveal organs, such as the heart, and cell types, such as gill neuroepithelial cells, that are active contributors to 5-HT homeostasis. The potential role of SERT in controlling circulating 5-HT is important because uncontrolled circulating 5-HT levels would lead to an undesirable vasoconstriction of the gill and detrimental reductions in oxygen uptake, an effect that could reduce hypoxia tolerance and limit survival. Project outcomes will also contribute to understanding the possible implications of SERT activation or desensitization with environmental perturbations such as hypoxia and pharmaceutical exposure. The project's educational and outreach impacts include engaging underrepresented youth in marine science and enhancing the participation of women and minorities in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our entire worldview is constructed by our brains from the barrage of sights, sounds, feelings, tastes, and smells that bombard us on a daily basis. Even slightly perturbing one of these senses can drastically alter how we behave and interact with the world. Interestingly, neuroscientists are only now beginning to understand how particular brain circuits transform these sensory inputs into that which is experienced consciously. The research here is dedicated towards understanding the brain circuits responsible for processing auditory information. This research should ultimately have broader impacts to society, providing an increased understanding of how the brain operates in both normal and diseased states. Moreover, this work has even broader impacts, in that it furthers our understanding of the nature of brain, mind, and behavior, and ultimately the human condition. Finally, this research is integrated with an educational outreach effort, a science radio program, The Groks Science Show, which is syndicated and broadcasted nationally through the Public Radio Exchange (PRX), and distributed as a podcast and on internet radio stations, including NSF's Science 360 Radio.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is to assess the role of the commissural projection systems in the auditory midbrain of the mouse. The central hypothesis is that excitatory and inhibitory cell types in this region receive convergent inputs from different sources, which differentially affect auditory receptive field formation. The research portion of this study will address two specific objectives: 1) Assessing the functional topography of inputs to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the inferior colliculus and 2) Characterizing the neuroanatomical projections to excitatory and inhibitory cells in the inferior colliculus. These studies will employ laser-scanning phototimulation mapping of functional circuit inputs, as well as cell-type specific retrograde viral tract tracing, i.e. a modified rabies virus, SAD&#916;G-GFP(EnvA) targeted using cre-lox recombination and AAV helper viruses. The proposed experiments should lead to further insight on the information-bearing roles of these auditory midbrain projections, as well as define the connectional architecture and functional properties of these connections in the mouse."

Two factors contribute to this diversity. One is that different neurons have different functions, and the other, is that different neurons have different evolutionary histories. However, neither evolutionary history nor classification of neuronal types is established. The goal of this project is to reconstruct the genealogy of neurons and develop an unbiased classification of neurons in the majority of animal groups. This will provide a way to predict the properties of neurons and their connections. A novel approach to determine the kinds of molecules that are expressed in different neurons will be developed. To gain access to critically important organisms, the Principal Investigator will organize worldwide voyages on research vessels to collect marine animals that represent all major types of neuronal organization. Thousands of distinct neuronal populations across species will be collected and analyzed with novel computational and mathematical tools. The work will create a new field of NeuroSystematics. The team will develop and test a novel approach for distant training of undergraduate and graduate students to perform real-time analyses at any world location.  The project will involve research collaborations with over 150 investigators from universities from many countries and will provide opportunities for international and underrepresented minority students to be involved in biodiversity research in remote oceanic laboratories. The project will also provide priceless resources and reference databases for several disciplines.<br/><br/>The research strategy is based upon the development of a mobile version of a nano-volume capture technology designed for massive transcriptome analysis of entire nervous systems at single-cell resolution. The focus will be on animal lineages never investigated before, including phoronids, brachiopods, xenoturbellids, and rare and fragile larvae.  The team will integrate phylogenomic tools and statistical geometry to characterize transcriptional divergence in cell type evolution and reconstruct neurogenic gene regulatory circuits. To incorporate the inherent statistical uncertainty in the genome, as well as natural selection within complex systems, stochastic approaches from information theory will be used to evaluate molecular diversities across dozens of classes of neuronal architectures. The genomic nature of species boundaries will be studied to reveal environmental and neurosensory limitations to the rates of speciation. Thus, deciphering the genealogy of neurons will be integrated with the functional and ecological constraints that underlie the formation of new behaviors."

The brain mechanisms underlying foraging and predator avoidance trade-offs are poorly understood. This work will therefore investigate how and where within the brain threat inhibits food consumption in frogs that have a highly-developed and easily accessible neural circuitry that controls feeding. Specifically, experiments will determine how a chemical produced in the brain when animals encounter a predator disrupts the processing of sensory cues that stimulate feeding and thereby inhibits the behavior when it is not adaptive. The studies fall within US national interests in that they will help maintain our role as a leader in science and technology by advancing knowledge of how nervous systems integrate information and generate behavior, fundamental goals of neuroscience research, as well as in their potential to produce unexpected insight into anxiety-related eating disorders. The work will also impact science education through the training of students from underrepresented groups who will be recruited through existing programs at Texas Tech University, the creation of new neurophysiology laboratory exercises to complement those already developed through NSF-funded programs, and the generation of new case studies for the NSF's National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. For outreach, the team will create a museum exhibit on sensory detection of prey and the ecology of fear at the Texas Tech Museum and provide supplies and materials related to amphibian biology, behavior and conservation to local elementary schools. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to understand neuroendocrine modulation of food intake in light of the ecological and evolutionary forces that guide optimal foraging. Specifically, the work will identify the neural mechanism(s) underlying modulation of multisensory prey capture by the stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). In the clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, CRF rapidly inhibits prey capture through modulation within the optic tectum, an important brain area for multisensory processing of both prey and predator cues in this and other vertebrates. The PI will now determine if tectal CRF R1 receptors inhibit multisensory guided prey capture. In the first aim, pharmacological and imaging approaches will be used to test if tectal CRF R1 receptors interfere with the processing of lateral line and/or visual cues related to prey capture. In the second aim, the role of sensory afferents and inhibitory GABA+ interneurons in mediating CRF inhibition of multisensory guided prey capture will be investigated. Together, these experiments will identify the mechanisms through which an important satiety peptide interferes with a multisensory pathway required for food acquisition. The findings will broadly impact our understanding of the neuronal basis for aversive behavior and its modulation in vertebrates and possibly shed light on the evolutionary origins of disorders in which fear processing pathways are disrupted. Work associated with this proposal will also be directly incorporated into undergraduate educational experiences, in the classroom and the laboratory, and will guide the development of exhibits in the local community."

Specifically, this project examines how maternal stress alters the morphology, behavior and physiology of offspring, and how these changes ultimately affect offspring survival - in both highly stressful and benign environments. The scientists challenge the widely held belief that maternal stress negatively affects offspring. They propose that maternal stress prepares offspring for high stress conditions. This project tests, in lizards, whether offspring of stressed mothers will survive better in high stress environments (containing predatory, invasive fire ants), worse in low stress environments and if lizards that come from stressful environments are better able to deal with stress. By testing the consequences of exposure to novel predatory ants, this project addresses the global issue of the impacts of environmental change. The results work will inform the prediction and management of the imported red fire ant, which currently threatens the survival of many vertebrates in the southern USA. This work will leverage the strong community interest in these invasive fire ants to engage students and the community in science. The investigators will partner with the Girl Scouts of Southern Alabama and Park Forest Middle School in Pennsylvania to develop science related education tools involving both the local community and school-aged students.<br/><br/>Maternal stress is a driving factor affecting offspring phenotypes and is traditionally viewed as 'costly' to organismal fitness. This project tests the hypothesis that predator-induced maternal stress adaptively prepares offspring for the high-risk environment experienced by the mother. It examines whether offspring from stressed mothers survive better in high-risk environments and the potential mechanisms (morphology, physiology, and behavior) that may affect survival differences. The investigators will use a combination of laboratory manipulations, and natural and semi-captive field experiments using free-living fence lizards (prey) and fire ants (predator). Maternal and egg stress levels will be experimentally manipulated and resulting offspring phenotype measured before offspring are released into high or low predator risk environments and natural survival measured. By testing these assumptions in fence lizards captured from fire ant invaded and non-invaded sites, this project evaluates the influence of an evolutionary history of risk on the strength of these effects. This project will contribute to the understanding of the consequences of maternal stress for offspring fitness within evolutionary and ecologically relevant environments, and challenge the assumption that consequences of stress are necessarily negative. The proposed project addresses the globally-important issue of invasive red fire ants. Investigators will partner with the Girl Scouts of Southern Alabama and Park Forest Middle School in Pennsylvania, developing science related classroom activities, educating the local community and school-aged students.

While this paradigm is under preliminary reconsideration today in light of new technologies and analyses, comparative studies of animals have long held that maternal provisioning of bacteria to offspring is widespread, spanning the base of the animal kingdom to vertebrates. Moreover, such bacteria are not simply innocuous passengers. They impart vital consequences to animal health and disease, and they have their own microbial interests, namely their propagation from mother to the next generation. In this context, there is a biological conundrum between host and maternally transmitted bacteria. High loads of bacteria can lead to pathogenesis in the animal offspring while low concentrations can lead to loss of the bacteria.  Balancing these opposing outcomes in the middle is one possible way to reconcile the extremes. Thus, the critical biological question is how are the concentrations of maternally transmitted bacteria regulated? Using a preeminent animal-microbe model, the investigators will genetically test the hypotheses that (i) animal hosts express multiple (rather than single) genes to control the concentrations of maternally transmitted bacteria (ii) when these genes are disrupted from their normal functions, the bacterial densities transmitted to the offspring will increase and (iii) these genes control the bacteria by preventing them from entering the developing offspring and repressing their replication.  This project will be the first study to deploy a unique genetic analysis that characterizes the animal genes that keep bacterial densities in check. The Principal Investigator will direct a one-week workshop for pre-service teachers (college students working towards a degree in education) based on the premise that the earlier that teachers participate in ""discovery science"", the more likely they will feel comfortable using it in the classrooms. The researchers will also partner with the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt to develop a Community Engaged Research Project in which Nashville high school students transfer experiential learning from the research lab back to their classrooms to engage in the process of cooperative and peer-to-peer learning for science- and technology-related investigations.<br/><br/>The majority of animal species harbor maternally-transmitted bacteria, yet little is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that the animal and bacteria use to achieve maternal transmission. For symbionts transmitted via the germ-line, bacterial density can critically influence transmission efficiency and penetrance of symbiotic traits induced by the symbiont. This research begins the first forward-genetic investigation of host genes that regulate densities of Wolbachia pipientis. The genus Wolbachia is a model endosymbiont because it occurs in more animal species than any other bacterium on the planet, and it can range from a beneficial symbiont in filarial nematodes, a parasitic manipulator of arthropod reproduction, to the main inflammatory agent of human filarial diseases. However, despite infection's prevalence, few host-Wolbachia interactions have been identified that control their densities. As a model host with genetic tools, the Nasonia parasitoid wasp genus is comprised of several closely related species that harbor unique strains of maternally-transmitted Wolbachia in their reproductive tissues. Transfer of these Wolbachia strains between the interfertile Nasonia species can result in dramatic changes in infection titers and tissue tropism. Specifically, the wVitA strain maintains a low infection density in its natural host, Nasonia vitripennis, but has a wider tissue tropism and stable infection density 100-fold higher in the naive host, Nasonia giraulti. Quantitative trait loci analyses specify that the regulation of the low wVitA density maps to three N. vitripennis chromosomal regions. This host regulation acts dominantly through a maternal effect - the mother determines the densities of her offspring. Thus, the central hypothesis of this research project is that multiple genes involved in host innate immunity and/or oogenesis act maternally to regulate Wolbachia densities in offspring. The goal of this project is to utilize an unprecedented interspecific difference in Wolbachia titers to identify the numbers and types of host genes that regulate Wolbachia densities, their additive and epistatic interactions, and their effects on Wolbachia localization and proliferation during oogenesis."

Some are highly streamlined and torpedo shaped; others are flattened and tall. It seems likely that some body shapes are better for swimming fast, others might be more maneuverable, and others might be more stable. It has been difficult to make these connections, however, because the internal mechanics of fish bodies also differ. Some are relatively stiff; others are very flexible. In this project, a group of fishes with different body shapes will be studied as they swim in water with eddies or other complex flow patterns. Their body movements and muscle activity will be recorded, which will allow their stability and efficiency to be measured. Then, based on the experiments, a computer model will be developed to simulate both the water movement and the flexible bodies of the fishes. The computer model can describe what might happen if the body shapes or body mechanics change. The model will be released for other researchers to use on similar problems, and the results will help in the design of better underwater vehicles and robots made out of flexible materials.

Then, swimming performance will be measured during swimming in oscillating flow and vortices, in order to estimate the active and passive contributions to stability and energetics for fish swimming in complex flows. This work will use tiny inertial measurement units to measure the body orientation and acceleration of fishes as they swim, which will allow us to estimate measures of stability. These measurements will then be used in computational models, starting with the body properties of one of the fishes and varying it to examine the functional effects of changes in the neural control strategy, body mechanics, and body shape, and how they contribute to swimming performance. The use of computational models to explore the implications of comparative analyses will be a powerful new paradigm, allowing manipulation of individual variables that cannot be done experimentally.

For instance, a golden orb-web spider or a black widow can spin six different types of dry fibers and a wet adhesive silk. The wet adhesive silks made by these spiders and their relatives (the megadiverse superfamily Araneoidea) afford them greater prey retention for a lower material cost than the dry prey capture silk spun by other spider groups. Furthermore, these silk glues achieve adhesiveness in a wide variety of environments, including extreme humidity conditions that challenge commercial glues. A multidisciplinary team from three institutions will investigate how variation in adhesive protein components relates to variation in the glue's material properties. The wet adhesive silks of the 18 target species have significant variation in adhesiveness, material efficiency, and response to humidity. Thus, the discovery of constituent proteins will allow design of environmentally friendly glues with tailored properties. Furthermore, web-building spiders offer many opportunities for science educators to integrate biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as they engage their students in the natural world. The team of investigators will mentor undergraduate and Master's students, as well as incorporate the research into undergraduate course curricula. Additionally, team members will offer science enrichment activities at rural Virginia public elementary schools, run workshops for middle and high school science teachers, and mentor New York City high school students to complete original research projects.<br/><br/><br/>The evolutionary diversity of spider aqueous glues offers a unique opportunity compared to other bioadhesives to determine how molecular building blocks contribute to different aspects of adhesion. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and biomechanics within a phylogenetic framework, the proposed experiments will pinpoint protein characteristics that co-evolve with interfacial adhesion, intra-glue cohesion, and humidity responsiveness.

First, training undergraduates at Florida International University, most of whom identify from traditional minority groups, to carry out some of the laboratory work. Second, hosting in the lab at-risk local high school students from a non-profit organization that aims to inspire at-risk and delinquent youth. Third, demonstrating a portable version of these experiments to the Miami Science Museum's annual Brain Fair, a community outreach event with local neuroscientists directed at teaching brain and behavioral sciences to children in the broader Miami area.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to determine the consequences of photon noise that is coupled to self-motion, and reveal the neural and behavioral mechanisms flies use to counteract its effects. The discrete and random nature of light absorption dictates that when photons are scarce, images suffer from low signal to noise ratios. This occurs whenever light intake is limited, such as when the environment is dim, or when eyes are physically small, or when objects move quickly across the visual field, which is often an inevitable result of quick flight. This project aims to determine how the fruit fly nervous system contends with degraded images just when it needs accurate visual information to coordinate responsive aerial movements. Tethered flies will view quickly moving projected patterns, which will establish the relationship between flow-induced photon noise, regional acuity, and attention. In the next stage, freely flying flies moving through obstacles will help determine the trade-offs of flight-induced noise and steering decisions, in other words the behavioral strategies that address and possibly minimize flow induced signal noise. And finally, sharp electrode elecrophysiological recordings will characterize spatial and temporal responses in early visual neurons while they view fast-moving patterns, which will then form the basis of biological models for viewing fast optic flow. The results of this project will offer neurobiological insight to the study of visual performance in moving animals, and practical insight to the design of artificial visual systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this process is the binding together of stimuli that compose the environment, or context.  For example, a person recognizes his/her home in part because various individual sensory stimuli have been linked together as a ""unit"" that is identified collectively.  These units of associated stimuli remain labile and can be updated as circumstances change.  Thus, contextual learning/memory provides an organism with several adaptive advantages, including the ability to recognize and predict where a biologically significant stimulus may be located.  Information regarding the physical and temporal context in which the object/event occurs is provided to the hippocampus by a network of specific cortical regions; yet, it is unknown how the components of this network contribute to processing contextual information.  This project will illuminate the how the different regions that compose the where/when pathway contribute to contextual learning/memory.  Addressing these issues will lead to the development of a new model of cortico-hippocampal function and provide essential information regarding the basic organizing principles of the mammalian hippocampal memory system.<br/><br/>Sophisticated behavioral methods will be combined with innovative neurobiological techniques (recordings and designer receptor-based manipulations of cell populations in awake, behaving animals) to determine how the restrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the postrhinal cortex (POR) contribute to contextual learning and memory.  Other studies will determine how the RSC and the POR interact at the synaptic level during learning. Carrying out the proposed studies will also provide valuable research training and opportunities for undergraduates at Dartmouth College, and use new initiatives to promote science education and research training, particularly in groups that are typically underrepresented in the sciences. At a community level, research findings will also be used to expose the local community to basic research in learning and memory through an outreach program developed in collaboration with a local science museum."

Speed and force combined require high power from muscles, but where does all of that muscle power come from? Fish head muscles are small, but the body muscles are large. Do fish transfer power from their bodies to their heads, similar to the way baseball pitchers transfer power from their legs and core to their throwing arms? Recent developments in 3D X-ray imaging have made it possible to measure power directly, and this project will use the new technology, XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology), to study fish with diverse body forms and feeding habits. The significance of this research is a new framework for understanding the structure and function of body and head muscles in 30,000 species of fish (half of all vertebrate species), and the results will impact ongoing research in numerous labs worldwide studying the biomechanics, ecology and evolution of suction feeding. This project will engage children from the Providence RI public schools in an after-school Marine Biology Science Camp, providing an opportunity to do fun science projects with students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. This project will develop a new technology, VROMM (Video Reconstruction of Moving Morphology), with similar capabilities as XROMM but with video cameras instead of expensive X-ray machines. VROMM will accelerate research by making the technology more widely available and advance US economic competiveness through technological innovation.<br/><br/>A recent study of largemouth bass showed that axial muscles provide more than 95% of the power for high-performance suction feeding, but these results so far come from just one species. Might axial muscles be the main source of suction power in most fishes? The goal of this project is to measure the power capacity of cranial and axial musculature relative to the power required for suction feeding in six species of fishes with different body forms and distant phylogenetic relationships to largemouth bass. XROMM combined with the dynamic endocast method will be used to measure instantaneous rate of buccal volume change, and a pressure transducer will be used to measure buccal pressure. Pressure multiplied by the rate of volume change will yield instantaneous suction power. Optimal muscle power capacity (Popt) will be calculated from muscle mass and the maximum power produced by fish muscle, which assumes shortening at the optimal velocity. Actual muscle velocity will be measured with XROMM and fluoromicrometry, and velocity-corrected power capacity (Pvc) calculated. The Pvc for cranial and axial muscles will be compared to the power required for suction feeding to determine the maximum power that cranial muscles can contribute, and therefore the minimum power that axial muscles must be contributing. These results may provide a new framework for studying suction feeding, in which the anatomy, biomechanics, and evolution of the axial musculoskeletal system should be studied as the power source for feeding, or at least as compromises between the needs of swimming and feeding."

This study examines a simple, yet novel, hypothesis to explain why so many animals have evolved elaborate and seemingly arbitrary traits and colors that they display to prospective mates during courtship. This project uses ideas from multiple fields of biology and psychology to test the idea that preferences learned in one context (such as a preference that an animal learns for a specific color of food) can affect the formation of preferences in another context (such as a preference for that same color when choosing a mate). These ideas will be tested in two species of jumping spiders: a Kenyan species that eats female mosquitoes (specifically, the vector of human malaria) where red colored food is preferred and an American species that feeds on many agricultural pests and where red colored food is avoided.  Work will alter female food color preference and then determine how this impacts the colors that females look for in mates. Both of these species play critical roles in their respective food webs; understanding how their populations respond to changes in prey have important implications for human health and agriculture. The study will engage several undergraduate student researchers, who will learn the scientific process through hands-on experience. In addition, it will fund the participation of several non-science majors at a local community college to improve scientific literacy among future leaders in other fields (e.g., politics, business, education). In addition to traditional scientific publication, the team will also disseminate findings in a collaborative art exhibit entitled Arachnophilia (to take place in both the US and Kenya).<br/><br/>Despite nearly 150 years of research to understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution of elaborate male ornamental traits biologists frequently stumble upon puzzling patterns in nature that challenge existing theory (e.g., yearly fluctuations in mate preferences, unexpected patterns of geographic variation in ornamentation and preference, and the presence of seemingly arbitrary ornaments). Clearly, the current theory falls short of fully explaining the complexity in nature. This study integrates ideas from across three distinct paradigms in animal behavior (sensory traps, sexual imprinting, and cross-contextual learning). It proposes a novel mechanism for the rapid evolution of male display traits: that an individual cannibalistic female's recent experiences with colorful food will shape how she interprets a male's colorful courtship display. Despite its simplicity, this idea could explain broad patterns of diversification and be applicable to a wide range of taxa. Using correlational field studies and manipulative lab experiments, this idea will be tested in two jumping spider species: Evarcha culicivora (a specialist on Anopheles mosquitoes in Kenya) and Habronattus pyrrithrix (a generalist predator from the southwestern USA). This study involves reversing the prey color preferences of these two species by exposing them to different types of naturally-occurring colorful foods and evaluating subsequent effects on mate preferences. This study capitalizes on the charismatic courtship displays of male jumping spiders to creatively link research, science education, and outreach. Work will be carried out by teams of undergraduate researchers (including non-science majors at a community college) and will be disseminated through a collaborative art exhibit."

For example, one animal might interact frequently with its groupmates, while another rarely does so.  An animal might be aggressive to another, but interact peacefully with yet others.  The researchers will investigate how these social networks change after conflict to either make conflict worse in the future, or to prevent conflict from re-emerging. The researchers hypothesize that social networks that we observe in nature will tend to change in ways that limit further conflict for two reasons.  First, we might not have much of a chance to observe networks that do not do so, as otherwise conflict becomes so severe that the whole group quickly breaks apart. Second, individual animals may benefit from avoiding conflict, and so they modify their behavior in ways that reduce the risks of further conflict.  To test this hypothesis, the researchers propose to explore how social networks change after conflict in the cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher, which live in stable, long-lasting groups using dynamical network models coupled with experiments in nature.  If social networks change in ways that limit conflict, this would help understand how groups of individuals with competing interests are able to stay together and prevent day-to-day quarrels from escalating. This project involves international collaboration in Zambia and training of students in both mathematical and biological research. This project is co-funded by the Animal Behavior program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the BIOMAPS program for proposals at the interface of Biology, Math and the Physical Sciences, and from the Office of International Science and Engineering. <br/><br/>The researchers propose to perturb groups of N pulcher in the laboratory and the field, for example by removing individuals to create opportunities for others to change social status.  They will conduct intensive behavioral observations on all group members before and after perturbation. They propose to use stochastic actor oriented models (SAOM) to analyze social network change. Stochastic actor-oriented models are a type of time ordered dynamic network model in which individual behaviors and network structures coevolve. They propose to use mathematical and computational models to test whether the patterns of connections found from the SAOM analyses are associated with low levels of conflict and high group stability.  Finally, the researchers propose to measure stress hormone (cortisol) levels and reproductive success to investigate whether individuals benefit from being in groups that are better able to limit conflict.  Findings from this research will provide insights into how individuals' social environment emerges through the effects of their interactions with one another, the resilience of the social environment to perturbation, and how the emergent social environment feeds back on individual performance and reproductive success."

Poison frogs do not make these toxins themselves, but instead acquire toxins from the ants and mites they consume in their diet. Although scientists have long known that poison frogs accumulate toxins from their diet, how the frogs accumulate the toxic chemicals is unknown. The goal of this research is to understand how poison frogs accumulate and move toxins from the gut through the liver and to the skin for storage. Describing this process will increase our knowledge of how animals have evolved special physiological mechanisms to acquire new resources from their environment. As many of these toxins and other frog chemicals are small molecules similar to many pharmaceutical drugs, understanding how poison frogs transport these chemicals may yield more general insights about how this process is different from other animals (including mammals), which cannot accumulate these compounds.

Although sequestering defensive chemicals is one component of well-studied ecological and evolutionary relationships between arthropod prey and frog predators, the mechanisms used by poison frogs to sequester and modify toxins are largely unknown. The overall goal of this research is to understand the physiological mechanisms of toxin bioaccumulation in poison frogs through three aims: 1) Identify proteins involved in bioaccumulation of dietary toxins in the Little Devil frog using thermal proteome profiling. 2) Determine toxin pharmacokinetics in distinct genetic backgrounds of the Little Devil frog using captive feeding experiments and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry across several time points. 3) Test the hypothesis that different Little Devil frog populations have local adaptations to efficiently accumulate chemicals found in local arthropod prey by characterizing population differences in toxin-binding protein abundance using tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Together, this work will test whether variation in toxin-binding protein levels is due to genetic differences between populations, response to dietary toxin availability, or a combination of both genetic and environmental contributions. This research will more broadly add to the knowledge of how ecological resources shape animal physiology."

For instance, a golden orb-web spider or a black widow can spin six different types of dry fibers and a wet adhesive silk. The wet adhesive silks made by these spiders and their relatives (the megadiverse superfamily Araneoidea) afford them greater prey retention for a lower material cost than the dry prey capture silk spun by other spider groups. Furthermore, these silk glues achieve adhesiveness in a wide variety of environments, including extreme humidity conditions that challenge commercial glues. A multidisciplinary team from three institutions will investigate how variation in adhesive protein components relates to variation in the glue's material properties. The wet adhesive silks of the 18 target species have significant variation in adhesiveness, material efficiency, and response to humidity. Thus, the discovery of constituent proteins will allow design of environmentally friendly glues with tailored properties. Furthermore, web-building spiders offer many opportunities for science educators to integrate biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as they engage their students in the natural world. The team of investigators will mentor undergraduate and Master's students, as well as incorporate the research into undergraduate course curricula. Additionally, team members will offer science enrichment activities at rural Virginia public elementary schools, run workshops for middle and high school science teachers, and mentor New York City high school students to complete original research projects.<br/><br/><br/>The evolutionary diversity of spider aqueous glues offers a unique opportunity compared to other bioadhesives to determine how molecular building blocks contribute to different aspects of adhesion. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and biomechanics within a phylogenetic framework, the proposed experiments will pinpoint protein characteristics that co-evolve with interfacial adhesion, intra-glue cohesion, and humidity responsiveness. Objective 1 identifies shifts in gene expression associated with the evolution of wet adhesive silk by profiling transcriptional diversity in each of the silk gland types of 5 divergent araneoid species and 3 outgroup taxa. It also investigates evolution of expression levels in the adhesive-producing silk glands of an additional 13 species that build different web types and forage under divergent humidity levels. Objective 2 identifies and quantitates the proteins that compose adhesive silks of all 18 species, as well as their post-translational modifications. Objective 3 measures wet adhesive silk material properties for the same 18 species at different humidities. These integrated experiments will contribute to understanding the origin and molecular underpinnings of a key innovation. Specifically, they will determine the degree to which gene expression shifts and new genes were required to make a novel type of silk. The proposed work will track evolutionary rates in glue protein characteristics, including post-translational modifications, which is currently poorly understood. Finally, glue material property measurements will test the hypothesis that humidity responsiveness of spider glue droplets has evolved for optimal performance at the humidity in which a spider species typically forages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is also a time of increased vulnerability to mental health disorders and increased sensation seeking thought to underlie an elevated incidence of deaths and injuries from accidents. These behavioral changes are accompanied by complex interactions between hormones and the brain, and a major challenge is to parse out which neural and hormonal factors are responsible for adolescent behavioral changes and which merely coincide with them. Activation of pubertal hormones in adolescence is the primary candidate. In this research project, a new model is introduced that makes use of a seasonally-breeding hamster species, for which the timing of puberty can be controlled simply by manipulating day length -- hamsters born and raised in long, summer-like day lengths undergo puberty early, whereas those born in short, winter-like day lengths delay puberty by several months in order to prevent breeding during the harsh winter months. The proposed experiments use this model to test the role of pubertal hormones in adolescent social behavioral and neural development. This research will advance understanding of the neural and hormonal factors that both drive adolescent social development and underlie the increased vulnerability of this life stage. An additional part of this project is the principal investigator's oversight of a student-run outreach program with the Buffalo Zoo to create zoo camps designed to spark children's interest in the sciences. The inclusion of University student participation promotes and provides training in science outreach and early childhood science education. <br/><br/>This project tests the role of pubertal hormones in adolescent behavioral and neural development, focusing on play behavior, the predominant social behavior in adolescent animals, and the 'social' vasopressin (VP) pathway, a pathway recently implicated in adolescent social development. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the role of pubertal hormones in the development of the 'social' VP pathway.  Its neuroanatomical development in the hamster model is being uncovered using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Aim 2 serves to determine the projections through which the 'social' VP pathway regulates play. The role of four key projection areas is being tested with site-specific infusions of a VP agonist and antagonist to determine how this pathway regulates social development. Aim 3 involves an initial test of the role of estradiol in early adolescent behavior. Estradiol levels are measured using enzyme immunoassay in the hamster model to determine whether day length impacts circulating estradiol levels in juvenile hamsters.

To counter these invaders, plants deploy a robust and effective immune system capable of detecting, appropriately responding to and restricting the proliferation of most microbes. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the detection of microbes and the signaling mechanisms associated with the induction of immunity are understood in ever increasing detail, the molecular mechanism(s) by which microbial proliferation is restricted by immune functions have been elusive. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the bacterial mechanisms targeted by plant immune action. Immune-activated plants appear to limit available sulfur, an essential element for life, thus blocking bacterial proliferation. Plant immunity also interferes with conserved bacterial responses to stress, resulting in the increased sensitization of bacteria to immune outputs. Characterizing these potential modes of immune action will have broad implications for our understanding of plant immunity and provide new targets and practical strategies to manage plant diseases. The project's broad educational goals include increasing pre-graduate competency in plant pathology, teaching plant and plant disease science to students from all backgrounds, including non-science majors, and enhancing scientific understanding through inquiry-based learning. The project's broader impacts expand public knowledge of plant diseases and may suggest new crop protection solutions. <br/><br/><br/>Driven by host recognition of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns, Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) is the first line of induced immune defenses used by plants against invading pathogens.  PTI plays a key role in restricting the unchecked growth of microbes. However, the mechanisms by which PTI restricts the growth of broad classes of microbes are unclear. The transcriptional response of bacterial pathogens to PTI is the basis for this project's focus on mechanisms of PTI action that restrict pathogen growth.  Deploying plant genetics, forward and reverse bacterial genetics, chemical and protein analysis, and bacterial transcriptomics, this CAREER project will test the following hypotheses: 1) Apoplastic sulfate sequestration restricts bacterial proliferation during PTI; 2) PTI outputs interfere with activation of the AlgU bacterial stress response cascade, resulting in increased bacterial sensitization to immune-associated stressors; and 3) although PTI outputs are multifaceted and semi-redundant, bacterial responses to PTI can be used to delineate and link specific outputs to sectors of the plant defense network. This project incorporates educational activities aimed at raising public knowledge about plant diseases and immunity and will focus on the education of non-specialist students. These goals will be achieved by the development of two undergraduate inquiry-based learning courses incorporating plant disease agricultural biotechnology concepts and targeted towards non-science majors, and by piloting peer-mentored, inquiry-based learning lesson plans about plant-microbe interactions for teachers in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, middle schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants are rooted in soil teeming with micro-organisms (bacterial, fungi and nematodes). Many of these can help plants grow better by, for example, making minerals directly usable by the plant, or by inhibiting the growth of plant-pathogenic microbes. The community of microbes on the surface of plant roots, and indeed inside the root, perform specialized functions to maintain their association with the plant. This community is called the root microbiome. Almost nothing is known about how plant-associated microbiomes are assembled from the very diverse soil microbial community. This project features a diverse group of investigators located at four institutions from New York, North Carolina and California, who aim to use interdisciplinary approaches from genomics to computer modeling to chemistry, to study the bacterial, and fungal microbes associated with plant roots. The goal of this project is to learn how to create communities of defined microbes that can be applied to crops as ""probiotics"" that will improve plant health and crop yield, and may replace chemical controls of disease and fertilizers. The diverse investigators will provide learning and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, post-graduate and post-doctoral scholars, and via outreach through the University of North Carolina's Morehead Science Center. <br/><br/>The investigators wish to understand communication between bacteria, fungi and plant roots (and between microbes in those roots) at spatial scales of nanometers (chemical signals) to centimeters (small scale ecosystems). Root microbiome organization is at least partly deterministic, as opposed to merely niche filling, at least at higher taxonomic levels. The project will deploy controlled microcosms and statistical modeling to define (1) principles driving root microbiome assembly in simplified synthetic communities, and (2) specific host and microbial genetic and chemical signaling mechanisms governing the winnowing from complex soil communities into reduced complexity endophyte communities. Anticipated results will lead to: (1) definition of reduced complexity communities of sequenced microbes that influence plant growth and can be deployed in re-colonization microcosm experiments to define and iteratively test experimentally models of the principles that drive community formation; (2) mutational identification of loci that tune root microbiome assembly from both microbes and plant hosts; and (3) collections of novel sequenced microbes that provide specific plant growth advantages and that are amenable to detailed mechanistic studies in both mono-association, and as members of defined complexity communities, with the host."

They can stick to smooth surfaces, and even walk inverted. The remarkable gecko adhesive system has become a model for evolutionary innovation and synthetic design. Gecko research over the past two decades has been as diverse as the group itself, including ecological, evolutionary, morphological, biomechanical, and material science foci. Indeed, interest in gecko-inspired adhesives has exploded since 2002, but progress is now slowing because dialogue and collaboration between materials scientists and engineers on one hand, and biologists on the other, is less intense than it should be. As a result, the former lack the knowledge of the ""real world"" in which these lizards employ their adhesive mechanism, and the latter have only just begun to recognize that the findings of biomimeticists and engineers can inspire new avenues for their own investigations. The symposium will explore the ways in which fundamental and applied approaches can reciprocally illuminate answers to challenging questions in gecko biology and gecko-inspired design of synthetic adhesives. The emergent collaborations and insight will fuel a new research path that will lead to the design and formation of products that will benefit society. In addition, the current understanding of gecko diversity will expand, leading to a deeper appreciation of these unique animals. The list of speakers transcends career stages, gender, and nationality, leading to the training of diverse STEM scientists.<br/><br/>Study of the gecko adhesive system requires integration across scales and clearly highlights the benefits of an integrative approach. Although much progress has been made over the past 15 years, the field has fallen short of a true integrative approach. What are now needed to propel the field forward are connections and collaborations between ecologists, evolutionary biologists, morphologists, biomechanists, and material scientists. The symposium is designed to address grand challenges in the areas of research devoted to organismal biology, as follows: Understanding the organism's role in organism-environment linkages (by addressing physical, physiological and genetic factors that constrain or promote adjustment to changing environments over different time scales); Exploring the functional diversity of organisms (by fostering collaborations between applied researchers and organismal biologists to advance bio-inspired technology); Integrating living and physical systems analysis (through cross-disciplinary inspiration, and the development of sustained collaborations); Understanding how genomes produce organisms (by understanding regulatory networks, integration and feedbacks that produce particular phenotypes, and mechanisms and feedbacks that mediate environmental effects on phenotypic expression and performance). The symposium will incorporate emerging areas pertinent to gecko adhesion, such as genomics, biochemistry and behavior, thereby expanding the reach of current research and application. The breadth of the contributions in this symposium and complementary sessions will foster advances on several fronts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, a golden orb-web spider or a black widow can spin six different types of dry fibers and a wet adhesive silk. The wet adhesive silks made by these spiders and their relatives (the megadiverse superfamily Araneoidea) afford them greater prey retention for a lower material cost than the dry prey capture silk spun by other spider groups. Furthermore, these silk glues achieve adhesiveness in a wide variety of environments, including extreme humidity conditions that challenge commercial glues. A multidisciplinary team from three institutions will investigate how variation in adhesive protein components relates to variation in the glue's material properties. The wet adhesive silks of the 18 target species have significant variation in adhesiveness, material efficiency, and response to humidity. Thus, the discovery of constituent proteins will allow design of environmentally friendly glues with tailored properties. Furthermore, web-building spiders offer many opportunities for science educators to integrate biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as they engage their students in the natural world. The team of investigators will mentor undergraduate and Master's students, as well as incorporate the research into undergraduate course curricula. Additionally, team members will offer science enrichment activities at rural Virginia public elementary schools, run workshops for middle and high school science teachers, and mentor New York City high school students to complete original research projects.<br/><br/><br/>The evolutionary diversity of spider aqueous glues offers a unique opportunity compared to other bioadhesives to determine how molecular building blocks contribute to different aspects of adhesion. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and biomechanics within a phylogenetic framework, the proposed experiments will pinpoint protein characteristics that co-evolve with interfacial adhesion, intra-glue cohesion, and humidity responsiveness. Objective 1 identifies shifts in gene expression associated with the evolution of wet adhesive silk by profiling transcriptional diversity in each of the silk gland types of 5 divergent araneoid species and 3 outgroup taxa. It also investigates evolution of expression levels in the adhesive-producing silk glands of an additional 13 species that build different web types and forage under divergent humidity levels. Objective 2 identifies and quantitates the proteins that compose adhesive silks of all 18 species, as well as their post-translational modifications. Objective 3 measures wet adhesive silk material properties for the same 18 species at different humidities. These integrated experiments will contribute to understanding the origin and molecular underpinnings of a key innovation. Specifically, they will determine the degree to which gene expression shifts and new genes were required to make a novel type of silk. The proposed work will track evolutionary rates in glue protein characteristics, including post-translational modifications, which is currently poorly understood. Finally, glue material property measurements will test the hypothesis that humidity responsiveness of spider glue droplets has evolved for optimal performance at the humidity in which a spider species typically forages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simultaneous oxidation of proteins is increasingly recognized as an important means of coordinating protein function both within and between cells. Specifically, the oxidation of cysteine residues (an amino acid within proteins) plays an important role in regulating proteins involved in fat metabolism, gene expression, and cell shape. However, little is known about how cysteine oxidation is coordinated between cells because it has been difficult to measure oxidation non-destructively in live organisms. Recent innovations in imaging of cysteine oxidation in living animals enable the researcher to fill this critical gap in knowledge, which currently limits understanding of how multicellular organisms coordinate diverse cellular processes. It is expected that the proposed research will have a wide-reaching impact on aging, metabolism, inflammation, and other fields where physiological processes are influenced by protein oxidation. The project integrates research and education by providing research and learning opportunities on the science of aging for students in grades 6-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and the public. These opportunities include laboratory research experiences and educational leadership development for undergraduates, research modules that engage hundreds of new undergraduates in cutting-edge research experiences, and an open classroom that will outreach to hundreds of senior citizens and establish inter-generational relationships between them and students.<br/><br/>Cysteine oxidation disrupts enzyme catalysis and is an important regulatory mechanism for hundreds of proteins that control a wide variety of cellular processes.

Protein oxidation will be measured with single-cell resolution in live animals, using a genetically-encoded, fluorescent sensor. The research questions addressed are: (1) How do sensory neurons regulate protein oxidation in distant target tissues? (2) How does local intercellular signaling regulate protein oxidation in specific target tissues? (3) How is the trajectory of protein oxidation with aging determined by intercellular signaling?

In humans, chronic sleep loss (insomnia, shift work, sleep apnea) has negative consequences on normal physiological and mental function and is a risk factor for many chronic conditions, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In the Arctic, migratory songbirds are active for 20 hours/day to take advantage of constant summer light, and seemingly do not suffer from the well-known detrimental effects of sleep loss, such as physiological and cognitive dysfunction. This research aims to investigate sleep patterns and assess the costs and benefits of sleep loss in arctic-breeding songbirds in Barrow, Alaska (71°N). Broader impacts of the proposal include training the next generation of science teachers to provide instruction to K-12 students of rural Alaska, engaging students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) and postdoctoral trainees from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in collaborative research, and disseminating research findings to scientists and the general public.<br/><br/>Sleep is essential for most organisms, although its precise function is enigmatic. Chronic sleep loss is well known to have detrimental effects on human health and performance. However, other species display a diversity of sleep patterns that challenge the assumption that reduced sleep is costly for all vertebrates. This proposal takes advantage of state-of-the-art miniaturized transmitters to assess sleep architecture in free-ranging songbirds. Arctic-breeding passerines exhibit extended wakefulness during migration and are active 20 hours/day on their breeding grounds where continuous daylight prevails. The project aims to investigate the sleep/wake cycles of two species of songbirds with different life-history strategies that breed in the high Arctic (Barrow, Alaska, 71° N).  It is hypothesized that both natural and sexual selection play a role in determining their sleep patterns. Next, daily sleep will be experimentally increased or decreased to assess life-history tradeoffs with fecundity and/or survivorship.  Lastly, the hypothesis will be tested whether arctic-breeding songbirds are more resilient to metabolic, cognitive, hormonal, and immunological costs of sleep loss compared with temperate-breeding birds in captivity. Broader impacts include a Future Teachers of Science program that fosters training of science teachers to develop teaching modules for K-12 students of rural Alaska and a cross-cultural research program for high school students of Alaska and Kentucky to assist with field research. Results from the research will contribute to our understanding of how arctic-dwelling species, including humans, cope with continuous periods of arctic light."

Plant architechture is largely determined by the genetic mechanisms regulating patterns of cell division, specification and early differentiation that occur in special structures called meristems.  The architecture elaborated by the inflorescence meristem is especially important because it controls reproductive patterning.  For example, the tassel and ear of maize are inflorescences and, thus, the processes that regulate their architecture control such things as the number and position of seeds that will form. This project aims to understand how a key class of gene regulatory molecules called microRNAs regulate maize inflorescence architecture.  The project centers on a mutant, fuzzy tassel (fzt), that affects a key enzyme required for producing microRNAs and plants with the fzt mutation display severe defects in inflorescence development affecting both the tassel and the ear. The project will employ genetic, molecular, and genomic approaches to identify microRNAs with key roles in inflorescence developement and link specific microRNAs and microRNA target genes to discrete stages of inflorescence development.  Modulating expression of microRNAs or microRNA target genes could be used manipulate inflorescence architecture and ultimately increase yield.  This project will also enhance science education by providing authentic research experiences for high school, community college, and early college students. The project will have a major impact because these groups often do not have access to independent research experiences.  For example, community college students will participate in a summer internship program and this is expected to ease their transition to a four year curriculum including science. A research based genetics lab course will also be implemented, allowing undergraduate students to participate in authentic research as part of the normal biology curriculum."

Chemical cues signal the presence of food, mates, predators, and toxic substances, and animals are attracted, repelled, or indifferent to individual odors. However, the responses of animals to chemicals are not fixed, but can be altered by their past experience and current state. For example, prolonged prior exposure to an odor decreases subsequent responses to that chemical, and juveniles and adults can exhibit different responses to chemicals. This flexibility ensures that the animal exhibits the behavior that is most appropriate for its current condition. The overall goal of this project is to explore how an animal's experience and its developmental stage alter the functions of the nervous system to drive different chemical-sensing behaviors.

The project also builds research relationships between university labs and high school students and teachers. The insights from this work are shared with the public via hands-on demonstrations at local science museums and science fairs. The proposed work also incorporates collaborations among biologists, chemists and bioengineers, and is thus expected to promote interdisciplinary learning and innovation.<br/><br/>Both innate and learned behaviors are flexible, and are extensively modulated by an animal's experience as well as its external and internal state. The specific goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecules, neurons, and circuits that mediate context- and developmental stage-specific plasticity in chemosensory behavioral responses of the nematode C. elegans. Preliminary experiments suggest that contextual cues modulate the output of antagonistic neural circuits to toggle the response to a simple alcohol between attraction and aversion. The behavioral strategies and neuronal mechanisms underlying this response flexibility is characterized using high-resolution analyses of behavioral states and neuronal activity under defined conditions. C. elegans chemosensory behaviors are also dramatically modulated as a function of developmental stage and environmental experience. The proposed research characterizes this experience- and stage-dependent chemosensory behavioral plasticity, and identifies the required neuronal and molecular mechanisms. Results from this work provide new information about the mechanisms by which animals efficiently alter their behaviors in response to changing external and internal conditions."

The complexity of these interactions has presented challenges to our efforts to fully appreciate the neural basis of food intake. However, before we can understand that complexity we must first identify the individual brain circuits that regulate food intake. The main goal of this project is therefore to use advanced genetic and anatomical approaches to identify a novel circuit that contributes to the control of feeding behavior. Identifying this circuit will ultimately allow us to determine how it works together with other feeding circuits that we already know more about to regulate a complex behavior critical for animal survival. In achieving that goal the work will not only increase our understanding of fundamental principles associated with how the brain regulates behavior, but may also lead to unexpected insights into feeding disorders and the chronic medical conditions associated with them that create considerable economic and social burdens, nationally and globally. In addition, this project includes a Summer Internship Program that will provide an integrated research experience for undergraduate students, particularly students who will be recruited from populations that are under-represented in science and medicine. These research experiences will provide such students with experiential learning opportunities that will create a foundation for future success in biomedical or basic research science.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Many studies agree that leptin controls food intake through activation of hypothalamic leptin receptors (LepRs). In addition, recent reports have examined the participation of extra-hypothalamic LepRs. In this regard, we have identified neurons in the rat raphe nuclei that are activated by leptin. Intra raphe administration of leptin increases pSTAT3 expression in discrete serotonergic neurons and suppresses food intake. Using optogenetic approaches, we were able to inhibit feeding behavior when the raphe neurons responsive to leptin were photo-stimulated, and we showed that intra-raphe leptin increases hypothalamic 5-HT levels.zpur overarching hypothesis is therefore that, in addition to direct hypothalamic actions, leptin powerfully regulates food intake by activating LepRs located in the raphe nuclei, thus stimulating 5-HT release in the hypothalamic nuclei where 5-HT exerts anorectic effect. The current project will test this hypothesis by studying the functional anatomical serotonergic connections between the raphe and the hypothalamic nuclei, measuring in vivo 5-HT release in the hypothalamic nuclei that receive serotonergic terminals following optogenetic stimulation of leptin responsive neurons of the raphe nuclei; and identifying the phenotype of the hypothalamic neurons that are activated by leptin-stimulated serotonin release. The idea that leptin is acting at multiple target sites including serotonergic neurons in the raphe will advance our understanding of the regulation of feeding behavior. This research will also be used to provide in-depth research opportunities for students from a nearby liberal arts college, particularly students from under-represented populations."

Despite their economic and ecological importance, surprisingly little is know about how bees evaluate the composition of the nectar (their source of carbohydrates) and pollen (their source of protein and fat) they collect from flowers. The nutritional value of these resources varies across plants, so bees often combine visits to several species to achieve a balanced diet. This project asks how the composition of a given plant's resources affects bees' foraging decisions and behaviors. It involves experiments on bumblebee foraging behavior, analysis of variation in nectar and pollen chemistry, and drone-based techniques to describe the nutritional landscape bees encounter as they visit wildflower communities. A natural history museum exhibit will educate school groups about the importance of nutrition for pollinators, and help visitors decide which backyard plants provide the best food for bees. Research experiences for undergraduates and science teachers-in-training will help train the next generation of scientists and help disseminate findings widely through future courses science teachers will lead. Many native bee species and populations are in decline, driven in part by changes to the nutritional resources available to them. Predicting how bees will respond to the introduction of novel foods offered by invasive, ornamental, or agricultural plants requires understanding how nutritional need guides their foraging decisions. The information this project will uncover can thus help inform efforts to conserve bee populations, whose own food security is directly linked to that of Americans.<br/><br/>Floral rewards mediate interactions between plants and their pollinators, shaping both plant communities and the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. Despite their functional significance, little is known about how the nutritional complexity of floral rewards structures species interactions, because most previous research focuses on a single reward type (most commonly, nectar). This project adapts a framework from the field of nutritional ecology to explore how foraging bumblebees balance the collection of multiple resources (nectar and pollen) from flowers. It investigates the strategies plants use to manage interactions with their pollinators via reward composition, and how the success of such strategies depends upon the offerings of co-flowering competitors. It explores the interaction between bees and the plants they visit under controlled conditions, involving floral surrogates. To test these ideas in field settings, analyses of floral rewards will be combined with observations of wild bee behavior to determine whether reward composition predicts which members of Sierra Nevada wildflower communities are co-foraged, and whether reward production depends on community context. The project aims to expand nutritional ecology beyond its consumer-centric focus, by asking how floral resource composition might alter forager/pollinator behavior to benefit the plant. This effort offers insight into pollen rewards, which are understudied despite their variation in composition and critical role in pollinator nutrition. Undergraduates are involved in research throughout, and this view of flowers as nutritional resources will be shared with the public via an exhibit, 'The Floral Supermarket' and the annual public Pollinator Festival at the University of Nevada, Reno's Pollinator Garden.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In plants, the extracellular matrix is termed the cell wall, and is partially composed of the carbohydrates cellulose and pectin.  Several cell surface proteins act as sensors or receptors for the state of the cell wall, monitoring its integrity and composition.  The Wall Associated Kinases (WAKs) are cell surface receptors that bind to the pectin in the cell wall, and regulate cell enlargement. WAKs are also activated by fragmented pectins generated by pathogens, mechanical stress and perhaps by normal developmental changes. The experiments that will be conducted during this project will begin to help in understanding the mechanism by which WAKs can distinguish and respond to different types of pectin in the cell wall, and thereby how plants sense the state of their cell wall, essential for their growth and development. This work will be carried out at a small liberal arts college where the focus is on undergraduate education and research. Students receive a thorough training in experimental science through work in this project, and a significant portion go on to graduate and professional school.  The PI also incorporates many aspects of plant cell biology and genetics from his lab into the core cell biology and genetics lab course at the scientist's institution, and is involved in courses for underprepared students in the sciences.<br/><br/>The cell walls of angiosperms are composed of a complex arrangement of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The pectins can be selectively and locally modified to be cross-linked into a structural network that can have dramatic effects on cell enlargement.  Localized digestion by plant secreted polygalacturonases can also modify the pectin network by loosening the cell wall to permit directional expansion of cells. Numerous pathogens and mechanical disruptions fragment pectin, often leading to a plant stress response. This project involves the Wall Associated Kinases  (WAKs) that bind to both long polymers of cross-linked pectin and to pathogen and damage induced pectin fragments, or  oligo-galacturonides (OGs). WAKs bound to native polymers are required for normal cell expansion, but bind newly generated OGs with higher affinity, and subsequently activate a distinct stress response pathway. This project will characterize receptor like kinases, cytoplasmic kinases, and potential scaffolding proteins that are phosphorylated upon OG treatment of Arabidopsis.  The role of each of the 5 individual WAK isoforms, clustered in one 30 kb locus in Arabidopsis will be genetically dissected using a new CRISPR/Cas9 based WAK deletion mutant. The puzzle is how one receptor type can distinguish and respond in different ways to different types of pectin, during development and the response to environmental disturbance. The goal is to understand if this is achieved through different WAKs each binding different pectins, and in combination with different co-receptors and ligands to activate alternate pathways."

Some examples include Zika virus, hepatitis C virus, foot and mouth disease virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. Despite infecting very different hosts and causing distinct symptoms, viruses in this class use similar strategies to replicate their genomic RNAs. As an indispensable process, viral replication also represents an excellent target for the development of antiviral strategies that should provide strong protection and apply to a wide range of important viral pathogens. This project aims to characterize the contributions of viral replication proteins and certain host proteins to viral replication and is expected to provide new insights on mechanisms required for viral replication as well as novel approaches for virus control. The project is also expected to provide undergraduate students from underrepresented groups with valuable experience in translational plant science and inspire them to seek more research opportunities and attend graduate schools in the field of plant science.    <br/> <br/>A highly conserved feature of positive-strand RNA virus replication is that these viruses remodel host intracellular membranes to form their viral replication complexes (VRCs), an essential step in viral replication. Despite its critical importance, the mechanisms by which membranes are remodeled, the lipid microenvironment within VRCs, and the host proteins required for such processes are poorly understood. This project aims to address aforementioned knowledge gaps by using brome mosaic virus (BMV), a model virus used to study the common features shared by positive-strand RNA viruses. BMV invaginates the outer nuclear membrane to form spherular VRCs. The investigators had previously demonstrated that a group of viruses promote host phosphatidylcholine synthesis at the viral replication sites for supporting viral replication. In particular, BMV replication protein 1a interacts with and recruits an enzyme of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis to the VRCs. The recruitment of the enzyme will be blocked by disrupting the specific protein-protein interactions to achieve virus resistance without affecting host lipid synthesis. Because the lipid composition of host intracellular membranes is dynamic and complicated, an in vitro assay has been developed to examine how BMV replication protein 1a and similar viral replication proteins generate membrane invaginations of liposomes with defined lipid compositions. In addition, host protein Erv14 has been found to be required for BMV replication. The mechanism whereby Erv14 is involved in BMV VRC assembly and the possible involvement of Erv14 in the replication of other plant viruses will be determined. <br/>"

Understanding the mechanism that has driven (and continues to drive) this amazing diversity is important, not only for science, but also for life itself. Knowledge of the history of life affects our way of thinking, our culture, and our society. Only recently, scientists have finally begun to understand how new body structures (novel structures) emerge during evolution. This project uses a core example of this novelty to explore a century-long question; where did the insect wing come from? Acquisition of wings has allowed the tremendously successful expansion of insects over the globe. However, the origin of insect wings remains a mystery and is regarded as a chief conundrum in biology. Through molecular and developmental analyses, wing-related tissues will be identified from a wide set of insects and other arthropods, which will allow for a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of insect wings. Gaining a comprehensive view of insect wing evolution will in turn advance our knowledge of the developmental basis underlying the development of new structures in general. The research will also further establish several organisms as alternative models for further genetic studies. In addition, this project will enhance undergraduate science education through establishing an infrastructure for student-oriented crowdsourcing efforts allowing researchers and students to publicly share the results of their gene disruption analyses and thus facilitate collaboration opportunities.<br/><br/>Over a century of debates and observations have culminated into two prominent hypotheses on the insect wing origin. One hypothesis, termed the paranotal hypothesis, connects the origin to the lateral extension of the dorsal thorax, the paranotal lobe. The second hypothesis, the exite hypothesis, connects the origin to the proximal leg segments and the branches (exites) stemming from these segments. Despite accumulating efforts to unveil the origin of insect wings, neither hypothesis has been able to surpass the other. A previous analysis in the Tomoyasu laboratory using Tribolium beetles has led to a combinational wing origin hypothesis, which states that insect wings have a dual origin, and that the merger of two unrelated tissues has been a key step in developing this morphologically novel structure during evolution. Further evidence for this hypothesis will be explored via (i) elucidating how the two tissues merge to form a complete wing structure in Tribolium, and (ii) identifying wing (serial) homologs from three additional species (a diving beetle, a cockroach, and a crustacean) to gain support of the hypothesis from a wider taxonomic breadth. RNA interference and expression analyses, along with CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing techniques, will be used to identify and follow the development of wing-related tissues in these organisms. The morphological comparison of the identified wing (serial) homologs in these organisms with those of Tribolium, as well as with the proposed wing origins will allow for the construction of a more complete history of the evolution of insect wings."

This plant cell wall provides structural support, defines the size and shape of cells, and provides a barrier to infection by pathogens. Plant cell walls are diverse and highly dynamic structures that respond to developmental and environmental cues. The main load-bearing component of plant cell walls is cellulose, which is made at the surface of cells by a large enzyme complex called cellulose synthase. In this project, it will be characterized how plants regulate how much cellulose they make. Prior work uncovered a pathway that controls this process by modulating the movement of the cellulose synthase complex to the cell surface. How this pathway works and how it interacts with the other elements in the cell to control cellulose synthase will be explored. Further, a novel signaling molecule, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a precursor to ethylene, was found to act in this pathway. How ACC is perceived by cells and how it acts to modulate cellulose synthase function will be determined. The results from this work will provide insight into how plants regulate cell wall biosynthesis, which is crucial to understanding the development of plant form and other processes and is important for the burgeoning biofuels industry. This project will interact with programs designed to increase the representation of minorities in the sciences and several outreach programs that aim to increase the public understanding of plant science.<br/><br/>A signaling pathway regulating cell wall synthesis has been defined that includes the FEI receptor-like kinases, SHOU4 (a novel transmembrane protein), and ACC acting as a signal independent of its conversion to ethylene. Prior results suggest that this pathway regulates CESA (cellulose synthase) function by modulating CESA trafficking to the plasma membrane. A diverse set of complementary experiments are proposed to further elucidate how this pathway regulates CESA function. A primary hypothesis that will be tested is that SHOU4 acts as a counter of CESA levels at the PM, with the complex generating a signal to negatively regulate CESA exocytosis to maintain optimal levels of cellulose biosynthesis. One key aspect of this model is the direct interaction of SHOU4 and CESA. This interaction will be further characterized, including elucidating the role of phosphorylation, potentially by the FEI kinases. Outputs of this complex will be identified by screening for proteins that interact with SHOU4. A second hypothesis that will be tested is that ACC negatively regulates CESA function. A genetic screen was used to identify elements involved in ACC perception. These mutant lines will be further characterized and the genes corresponding to these mutations will be cloned and characterized. These studies will increase the understanding of how cell wall biosynthesis is regulated, a process that is central to many aspects of plant growth and development and which is important for the burgeoning biofuels industry. Further, these studies will begin to define the mechanisms underlying ACC function in plants.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional wisdom holds that animals - from humans to fruit flies - choose the ""best"" partner based on that partner's vigor and health, but more and more work has shown that reproductive decisions are heavily shaped by one's own personality, psychology, and experiences. In particular, people and animals who are bold and extroverted tend to seek different mates and act differently during courtship than those who are shy and introverted.  Part of this may have to do with learning - extroverts learn better from positive rewards, introverts learn better from negative experiences. This project explores the genetic and behavioral connections between personality, learning, and mate choice.  This is done by testing mate preferences, shyness and boldness, and learning ability in the same individuals, and by using genomic technology to search for a common genetic basis underlying these features.  This work will help us understand how reproductive decisions change with the environment and drive the origin of new animal species. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A main focus is to expand an ongoing mentorship program focused on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. In this project, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>Hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of mating preferences have focused on their adaptive value with respect to mating decisions. A growing body of work has shown that biases unrelated to mating, notably at the sensory periphery, can shape mating preferences. If these biases are under divergent ecological selection, this can facilitate reproductive isolation. This project focuses on whether interspecific differences in mating preferences can emerge from personality, an ecologically important suite of behavioral traits. The swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and Xiphophorus birchmanni diverge in both mating preferences and personality traits. The proposed project seeks to unravel the common mechanisms underlying personality, preference development, and mating decisions. This will be accomplished by (1) measuring phenotypic correlations between non-sexual exploratory and risk-avoidance behavior, mate-sampling patterns, and mating preferences; (2)  using aversive and appetitive conditioned-response paradigms to evaluate the relationship between personality and learning mode; (3) characterizing the relationship between learning in sexual and non-sexual contexts; and (4) using hybrid genetic lines to elucidate genetic covariance between personality and preference and identify candidate genomic regions.  The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A primary objective is expansion of an established mentorship program out of the CICHAZ field station in central Mexico, which currently focuses on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students.

In most of these model species, males also happen to be larger than females. However, in several lizard species in which females are larger, testosterone inhibits growth. This raises the intriguing possibility that, far from being hard-wired, the effects of testosterone (and other hormones) on growth and other processes may change considerably during evolution.

It may also challenge generalizations derived from traditional animal models by investigating how closely related species evolve different responses to the same hormone. The project will also contribute to filling national teaching needs and will involve high school teachers in research experiences in an intensive summer program. Research training opportunities are being provided for a post-doctoral fellow, a PhD and an MS graduate student, and two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This Collaborative project addresses an issue of current debate in comparative endocrinology: whether the highly conserved vertebrate endocrine system tends to constrain adaptation, or whether key evolutionary changes in the coupling of hormones to gene networks instead facilitate rapid evolution. This project will combine hormone manipulations and high-throughput RNA sequencing aimed at (1) characterizing how the expression of growth-regulatory gene networks differs with respect to age, tissue, and hormone treatment using detailed experiments on three focal lizard species, (2) testing for evolutionary reversals in the hormonal regulation of growth and gene expression by extending these methods to a broader, phylogenetically informed sampling of related lizard species with variable patterns of sexual dimorphism in body size (male-larger or female-larger), and (3) characterizing rates of sequence evolution for thousands of expressed genes to test whether the specificity of expression that is achieved by hormonal regulation also frees coding sequences themselves to evolve more quickly. This research will support development of the recently sequenced genome of the Eastern Fence Lizard as an emerging resource for the fields of comparative endocrinology and evolutionary genetics. This project enhances the professional development of science educators through Teacher Workshops and Teacher Fellowships administered through an ongoing education program, which fosters teacher-scientist collaboration and authentic scientific discovery in the K-12 classroom. In addition, research training opportunities and funding are provided for a post-doctoral fellow, a PhD student, a MS student, and for two undergraduates each year.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Evolutionary Processes Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund of the Emerging Frontiers Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To make this possible, the body and the nervous system must work together to generate appropriate behavior. Rather than using a central control that specifies all details of the responses and sets a fixed goal, recent studies suggest that nervous systems generate appropriate motor responses ""on the fly"" based on the internal state of the organism and the immediate environmental context, which may change as the animal acts, in part due to the animal's own behavior. By studying this problem in an animal that is tractable to experimental analysis, it will be possible to work out the detailed neural circuitry that underlies these rapid, flexible and adaptive changes in behavior, and to track changes in circuit activity as an animal behaves. To do this, novel technology will be developed that makes it possible to record and control the activity of many neurons during behavior. The resulting technology could have a broad impact on the development of novel brain/computer interfaces, which could lead to new prosthetic devices. At the same time, working out the details of neural circuitry for adaptive, flexible behavior will provide designs for creating flexible control of biologically-inspired robots. The research will train students who can solve interdisciplinary problems, and is likely to attract students to careers in science and technology.<br/><br/>Studies of motor control in invertebrates and in the spinal cord of vertebrates and humans suggest that motor control is not a hierarchy in which a central controller selects motor responses, but a heterarchy in which motor components are added or removed depending on an organism's internal state and the immediate environmental context. To determine how motor components are dynamically assembled, the neural circuity of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica will be analyzed as animals feed on seaweed that challenges them with changing mechanical loads. Circuitry will be studied in intact animals, in a reduced feeding preparation, and in the isolated nervous system. A microelectrode array will analyze overall changes in patterns of neural activity using extracellular recordings. In collaboration with the NeuroNex hub at University of Michigan, a novel ganglion interface will be developed using biocompatible glassy carbon fiber electrodes, which can record from multiple sites both extracellularly and intracellularly. The fibers will be modified to allow them to control neuronal activity as well. The resulting device could create novel interfaces for neural control in intact, behaving animals. A neuromechanical model will be developed to predict how changing activity of key identified neurons affects force output. Novel circuit designs for flexible motor control will be implemented in biologically-inspired soft robots.

Obliquely striated muscle cells are common in soft-bodied animals, occurring in members of at least 17 phyla, yet the implications of oblique striation for the function and performance of this important muscle type are unknown.  It has been assumed for decades that oblique striation permits relatively high force output over an extraordinary range of muscle lengths.  Recent work, however, suggests that the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles are very diverse, even among muscles within the same individual animal.  The project will investigate the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles from diverse animals.  This research is likely to reveal fundamental new principles of the structure and function of muscle that would otherwise remain obscure, and provide new insight into the diversity of function and the evolution of this fiber type.  The project will provide opportunities for undergraduates, especially first-generation college students and those from underrepresented backgrounds, to gain experience in physiology, biomechanics, and science communication.  In partnership with the Maine State Aquarium Discovery Center, the project will develop programs for K-12 students and the general public.  The project will also impact secondary education through collaboration with the UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC-BEST) program, which offers undergraduate Biology majors opportunities to obtain licensure as a secondary school teacher in North Carolina.<br/><br/>Although obliquely striated muscle occurs in at least 17 animal phyla, the functional implications of this striation pattern remain unclear.  Early studies suggested that oblique striation allows high force output over a much wider range of muscle lengths than possible in cross-striated muscle.  Recent work, however, shows that many obliquely striated muscles are incapable of such wide operating ranges and instead, there is considerable variation in this parameter.  The current understanding thus fails as a general explanation for the functional significance of oblique striation.  The goal of the investigation is to test a new model, based on mathematical analysis of the geometry of the myofilament array, which suggests that oblique striation evolved to allow adjustment of the length-force relationship in animals with hydrostatic skeletons.  The model predicts that the length-force relationship can be adjusted by altering the stagger angle (i.e., the degree of stagger of the myofilaments), with greater stagger resulting in a wider operating range.  Measurements of length-force properties, in vivo muscle activation and length changes, and muscle fiber ultrastructure will be used to test the model predictions and assess the functional significance of oblique striation.  The initial investigation will focus on the myofilament stagger and the length-force relationship of muscles in the squid Doryteuthis pealeii that vary widely in function and operating length range.  In addition, muscles with similar roles and length-force relationships among select taxa that span the range of Bilaterian diversity will be studied, thus identifying structural and functional convergence in obliquely striated muscles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the beneficial roles of many microbes are well established, it is not yet known how these benefits scale up to an entire population and influence disease outbreaks in populations. This award focuses on a contagious 'pink- eye' disease of a common songbird, the house finch. Beneficial bacteria in the eyes of finches can protect birds from developing severe 'pink-eye'. This project examines how the dose of infection impacts the ability of beneficial bacteria to protect birds against disease, and whether beneficial bacteria on the eye can prevent or slow down the spread of this highly contagious disease within a flock of birds. Findings of this research will have important implications for understanding infectious disease outbreaks in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.  Investigators will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the use of new genomics tools to identify beneficial microbes. Using this study system and others as examples, project personnel will work with the Science Museum of Western Virginia to design a permanent, interactive 'Friendly Microbes' exhibit that illustrates the many ways that microbes benefit their hosts. Graduate students at Virginia Tech will learn how to better communicate science by assisting with the exhibit design and summer workshops associated with the exhibit. <br/><br/>How the microbiome modulates population-level disease spread depends on how symbionts function in host defense across the natural range of infectious doses, as well as how both 'donating' and 'receiving' the pathogen during transmission is modified by symbionts. This award investigates individual to population-level effects of the ocular microbiome on disease dynamics using a tractable wildlife disease system: a recently emerged conjunctival disease of house finches. Using a suite of mechanistic tools and experimental approaches, this project will: 1) test how pathogen colonization dose mediates the protective role of the resident ocular microbiome for individual finches; 2) determine how the ocular microbiome influences the likelihood of donating versus receiving a conjunctival pathogen during pairwise transmission; and 3) quantify the epidemiological impact of the host ocular microbiome on flock-level infectious disease dynamics. Researchers will examine how microbial symbionts alter both host and pathogen phenotypes relevant for transmission and reveal mechanisms of symbiont-pathogen-host interactions that are most likely to influence population-level disease dynamics. The award will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in population-wide microbiome research as well as scientific communication. Researchers will develop a new, permanent exhibit at the local museum on the beneficial role of microbes and host workshops to promote scientific literacy on this topic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animals produce a wide variety of sounds to mediate critical interactions, including advertisement to potential mates and competitors. But why and how do distinct species sound different and what factors contribute to such differences? The widespread importance of acoustic signals in mate recognition and speciation requires a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of signal divergence. In this project, the physiological mechanisms underlying sound production across an ecologically diverse group of vocal rodents will be studied. The researchers will test the hypothesis that changes in sound production mechanisms are mediated by variation in social organization and spacing. These studies promise to provide important insights into the evolutionary interplay between the physiology of senders, receivers, and their socio-spatial ecologies. The proposal provides training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, research technician, and student participants who are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical sciences. In addition, the work develops inquiry-based learning modules that equip middle school classrooms with animals, microphones, and sound analysis software to foster critical thinking skills. The research will be supplemented with outreach at regional events and virtual live streaming of experiments in an indoor animal-tracking arena to allow the public to engage in scientific discovery. Digital audio, video, and morphological specimens will be permanently archived for open access in public repositories.<br/><br/>A central challenge in the study of behavior is connecting functional and mechanistic explanations for the evolution of complex phenotypes. Advertisement vocalizations used in reproductive contexts are among the most diverse and elaborate displays in the animal kingdom, yet understanding of the physiological mechanisms driving acoustic divergence is lacking. The goal of the proposed research is to integrate functional and mechanistic perspectives in senders, receivers, and the environment to understand the evolution of acoustic signals in relation to variation in social organization. Rodents represent over 40% of mammalian diversity and exhibit extreme variation in social structure and space use, even among closely related species. Investigators will leverage the exceptional divergence in social organization and acoustic behavior found in one clade to dissect the sound production mechanisms underlying signal diversification. The work integrates approaches from the field, laboratory, and mesocosm, including high-resolution acoustic recordings and laryngeal morphometrics, auditory electrophysiology, sound propagation experiments, and animal tracking studies to evaluate the socio-spatial context of vocal production. The findings will provide a rich dataset to investigate the evolution of communication systems in relation to variation in social organization, with broad implications for other taxa across all signaling modalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amoebae ingest the bacteria and enclose them in a compartment for degradation. The bacterium Legionella pneumophila resists degradation by changing the membrane-bound compartment so that it can proliferate. This intracellular survival strategy is common to many bacteria, however, the mechanisms that underlie this strategy are not well understood. The research supported by this award will define the molecular mechanisms through which Legionella controls and manipulates the eukaryotic cell and resists degradation. This information will lead to novel insights into how bacteria are able to survive within eukaryotic cells, including immune cells such as macrophages. As such, this research has the potential to provide a better understanding of bacterial pathogenesis.  The educational goal of this project is to stimulate interest in science at multiple educational levels with a focus on retention of students from underrepresented minority groups. This goal will be accomplished by partnering with the Upward Bound Math/Science program at the University of Delaware to stimulate enthusiasm for scientific research by providing high school students with authentic research experiences, developing a research-based module to enhance the current undergraduate microbiology curriculum at the University of Delaware, and developing and implementing interactive materials and hands on activities for families attending the Delaware Children's Museum. Since diverse undergraduate and graduate students will participate in these community outreach activities, children will observe that people of various ages and ethnicities can be scientists. This project is co-funded by the Symbiosis, Defense, Self-recognition Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.<br/><br/>In nature, amoebae ingest bacteria by phagocytosis, and once internalized, bacteria remain enclosed in a plasma membrane-derived compartment that is destined for degradation by fusion with lysosomes. However, L. pneumophila remodels the cytosolic surface of the vacuolar membrane to avoid degradation. The integrity and remodeling of the vacuole is critical for survival of L. pneumophila and its establishment requires the activity of bacterial proteins delivered into the host cell via a specialized secretion system. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that remodeling of the replication-permissive vacuole depends on the bacterium's ability to target and regulate host membrane trafficking. The principal investigator will apply microbiological, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms that bacterial proteins use to selectively target host vesicles in order to promote bacterial survival. The focus is on refining our understanding of how bacterial proteins manipulate the activity of two key components that regulate host vesicular traffic: Rab GTPase proteins and phosphoinositide lipids. Results obtained here will advance the field of host-microbe interactions by further defining how free-living bacteria can acquire the capacity to grow within eukaryotic cells.

Many of the gene products controlling these early steps in development determine cell fate through their function as regulatory genes, encoding transcription factors or signaling proteins that regulate the expression of downstream cascades of genes encoding products directly involved in growth and differentiation of different cell types.  If these regulatory genes are active in the wrong cells at the wrong time, it is catastrophic for the embryo, which will likely die as a result of this mis-expression.  The goal of this project is to unravel the mechanisms controlling the activity of embryonic regulatory genes. It will use a well-established animal model, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, for these studies. The focus is on one family of embryonic transcription factors, a nuclear receptor, which is regulated by interactions with protein partners. Findings will provide a fundamental model for studies of other members of the nuclear receptor family, in Drosophila and other species, by contributing to an understanding of cell type specification during embryonic development and elucidating different levels at which the function of transcription factors is regulated to produce unique cell types. This proposal will train students from diverse backgrounds in the laboratory in bench science, critical thinking and scientific presentation.  In addition, it will support formal collaborations with a majority minority middle school in Maryland(Wilde Lake Middle School)to bolster the genetics curriculum for 7th graders and with the MARC program at Northeastern Illinois University that will send up to two students/year for summer internships to Northwestern. These efforts are part of ongoing efforts on the part of both the PI and Co-PI to educate the public about science.  <br/><br/> Nuclear Receptors (NRs) are a large family of transcription factors that control a broad range of biological processes. Although the activity of many NRs is regulated by ligand, a large number of these receptors are orphan NRs that share a common fold with NRs with known ligands. This likely reflects the ancestral state of this protein family.  How is the activity of orphan NRs regulated? Drosophila Ftz-F1 is the founding member of the NR5A nuclear receptor family.   In previous work, the Principle Investigator and colleagues showed that Drosophila Ftz-F1 interacts with the homeodomain protein Ftz, a classic pair-rule protein expressed in seven stripes in embryos in the primordia of body regions missing in ftz mutant animals.  Ftz-F1 and Ftz form a stable complex in vivo and bind to composite DNA sites, synergistically activating target gene expression.  Thus, although Ftz-F1 is a strong transcriptional activator alone in vitro, and it is present in the nuclei of all somatic cells of the embryo, its activity is limited to the cells in which Ftz is also expressed (Ftz+ cells).  These studies demonstrate that protein-protein interactions modulate Ftz-F1 activity and provide an in vivo model system to dissect the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Here we will test whether Ftz-F1 is regulated: (1) at the level of DNA binding; (2) by a corepressor/coactivator exchange, and/or (3) by Ftz-induced conformational change. This work will combine biochemical and structural methods with molecular genetic approaches in Drosophila embryos to evaluate the contributions of each of these mechanisms to the regulation of NR activity in vivo. It will train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics and, most importantly, critical thinking: generating, testing and evaluating hypotheses."

This project will elucidate the chemical structures of signal molecules and blends (pheromones) used in moth mating communication, quantify behaviors elicited by these chemicals, uncover mechanisms of pheromone production and reception, and identify genes that underlie all these processes. This project will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of pheromone blends in females and response profiles in males and females among populations and across closely related species. Because many moth species are important pests in agricultural crops, forests and stored grains, this research has practical significance for society through the discovery of new tools for ecologically based pest control. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student in a multidisciplinary environment that includes quantitative analysis of behavior, chemical ecology, neuroscience and genetics. A unique feature of this project is the collaboration with the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and the Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Germany, which will offer the postdoctoral researcher and graduate student unique training in evolutionary, chemical, and molecular biology in a collaborative international setting. The project will recruit and train undergraduates from underrepresented demographics from North Carolina State University and nearby Historically Black Universities.

Finally, trainees in this project will participate in public education and engagement events, including BugFest (the largest STEM education program in the US with ~35,000 participants annually), Science Cafés, the Science of Attraction (300 participants in 2014), and other public education programs.<br/><br/>Three major questions in animal sexual communication motivate this project: 1) What features of close-range male sexual signals affect female choice; 2) What information do components of the male's complex signal convey to the female; and 3) Is the production of male sexual signals biochemically and genetically linked to production of female signals. Answers to these questions are critical not only for understanding the roles of reciprocal signaling and mate choice in the evolution of sexual communication systems in animals, but will also lead to a better understanding of how the evolution of mating preferences can lead to reproductive isolation among populations, and ultimately to the origin of new species. Researchers have largely ignored close-range courtship behavior by male moths, including the release of close-range sex pheromones, female assessment of the male pheromone, preference, and ultimately acceptance or rejection of the male. This project is based on the recent discovery of novel compounds in the male pheromone gland, some of which share biosynthetic origins with female-produced pheromones, while others are chemically unrelated and may be sequestered from larval and adult food. This dual chemistry can provide females with a dual assessment of the male's ability to (a) de novo biosynthesize pheromone compounds similar to hers, and (b) acquire essential nutrients, and grow on a well-defended plant. This project integrates insect mate choice with insect-plant interaction strategies and investigates the new male compounds as a novel class of sexual signaling molecules in insects."

However, the effect of water limitation on the plant-microbe communication in the rhizosphere remains virtually unexplored. The approach focuses on Pseudomonas synxantha 2-79, a model biocontrol strain that is naturally adapted to wheat grown in arid parts of the Pacific Northwest. The specific aims are to characterize the changes in wheat root exudates that are associated with water stress and to relate these changes to the physiology of 2-79; to identify transcriptional responses in 2-79 to water-stressed conditions using RNA-seq; and to define the contribution of selected pathways to the ability of 2-79 to persist on roots under conditions of water deficit. The expected results will help to understand how rhizodeposition in arid soils modulates bacterial pathways involved in the mitigation of drought stress and contributes to the selection of specific types of beneficial rhizobacteria. The project will also provide a crucial functional genomics complement to ongoing field studies aimed at deciphering the effect of soil moisture on the rhizosphere microbiome of dryland wheat."

This plate consists of proliferating neural stem cells that differentiate and form all of the neurons and glia of the brain and spinal cord. To create a brain of the correct size and organization, the neural stem cells must be tightly regulated such that they replenish themselves through cell division, and then differentiate into neurons at the right time during development. Many of the signals required to induce neural stem cell formation and to direct neuron formation are known, however how the regulatory signals are relayed, interpreted and coordinated to form a complex, centralized nervous system is unknown. To determine how these signals induce and instruct neural stem cells, the process will be compared in both a simple (marine acorn worm) and complex (frog) organism. The acorn worm and frog have similarly structured nervous systems but use unique routes during development to reach the same end. Thus, comparison of the induction and segregation of their nervous systems allows for the identification of the essential components and changes that evolved to allow for the development of the complex vertebrate brain. These studies are fundamental for explaining how multiple signals are integrated and decoded to regulate stem cells and to form a highly structured organ. These studies will provide numerous training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students including members of underrepresented groups in science and are essential to the development of the acorn worm as a model organism to study the development of the brain and other organs.  <br/><br/><br/>The specification of neuroectoderm and the maintenance of a neural progenitor population are tightly regulated and fundamental to the development of the central nervous system. While many of the signals (BMP and FGF) and transcription factors involved in neurogenesis are known, the mechanisms by which signals drive changes in gene expression and how the signals are coordinated to maintain a balance of proliferating stem cells and differentiating neurons are not well defined. This project examines the role of FGF and BMP signaling in neural progenitor induction, maintenance and segregation in the chordate Xenopus laevis and the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. The molecular and embryological tools in Xenopus enable identification of the molecular mechanisms downstream of BMP signaling that induce the nervous system, and the identification of the roles of FGF in the induction and maintenance of progenitors. The Xenopus studies combined with analysis of the formation of the nervous system in Saccoglossus allows for the identification of conserved and novel regulatory themes in the specification and segregation of neural cells. The unique neural organization and development of Saccoglossus provides a unique opportunity to address a major question in developmental biology - How do changes at the molecular level drive significant morphological changes? This critical deuterostome dataset will broaden the phylogenetic perspective and provide insight into the evolutionary history of the development of the nervous system. These studies will provide numerous training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students including members of underrepresented groups in science and the focus on technique development in Saccoglossus is essential to its development as a model organism to study neural development."

The responses of an organism to current environmental conditions can depend on conditions it experienced in the past, due to either stress (negative effects) or acclimation (positive effects).  Biologists currently lack a framework for understanding and quantifying those effects: the goal of this project is to develop and test such a framework, using the growth responses of a model system, the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta), to variable temperatures. The research integrates physiological experiments, genomics analyses and mathematical models to predict the consequences of stress and acclimation on growth, development and survival, and to test these predictions for unpredictable temperature conditions. This new framework will allow a quantitative understanding of responses of Tobacco Hornworms and other agricultural pests to variability in weather; the general framework should be applicable to most other 'cold-blooded' animals.  The project provides research training and experience for undergraduate and graduate students, and develops a new citizen science program for monitoring butterflies and moths in the piedmont region of North Carolina.<br/><br/>During the course of a single lifespan, terrestrial ectotherms often experience wide variation in temperature and other environmental factors. An individual's performance can vary with temperature, represented as a thermal performance curve (TPC), and TPCs are the basis for many models predicting organismal responses to fluctuating temperatures. However, many ectotherms exhibit time-dependent effects, including stress responses and acclimation, where the duration and order of prior temperature exposure affect organismal performance; these effects are ignored in the standard TPC approach. The studies proposed here develop and test a new framework for incorporating time-dependent effects into models of ectotherm performance, using growth rate of Manduca sexta larvae in fluctuating temperatures as a model system. The proposed studies integrate physiological experiments, functional genomic and protein analyses, and mathematical models to develop and parameterize a systems modeling framework for stress and acclimation responses, and test predictions from this model in response to stochastic variation in diurnal temperature fluctuations. The proposed research will provide the bases for a new conceptual and modeling framework for understanding and predicting the effects of variation in temperature and climate on growth and fitness of ectotherms.

A better understanding of cytokinin signaling will enable optimization of crops to improve their performance in various agricultural settings. The goal of this project is to uncover how the cytokinin hormone signal regulates gene expression in plants, and thereby controls plant growth and development. State-of-the art mass spectrometry approaches will be used to identify regulatory modifications on proteins and how these modifications change during the cytokinin response. The proposed research will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. In addition, through a local partnership, the project will establish a summer program aimed at developing education and science awareness through participatory activities that integrate science with art.<br/><br/>The current paradigm for cytokinin signaling involves a two-component His-Asp phosphorelay similar to that found in prokaryotes. In this model, phosphorylation of the type-B response regulators (RRs) on a conserved Asp residue regulates their transcriptional activity, thereby controlling the transcriptional response to cytokinin. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the type-B RRs also serves to regulate their activity. The prediction is that rapid cytokinin-dependent changes in Ser/Thr phosphorylation will occur, and that these will activate the type-B response regulators independently of Asp phosphorylation. Phosphoproteomic approaches will be employed to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites of the type-B response regulators and to characterize their phosphorylation dynamics in response to cytokinin. The regulatory significance of Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites will be tested by mutating the residues to phosphomimic (Glu) and non-phosphorylatable (Ala) versions of the residues, and their activity examined in a reporter system. Uncovering a Ser/Thr regulatory mechanism for the type-B RRs will fundamentally alter our model as to how cytokinin signal transduction occurs in plants, and also yield novel information on how the evolutionarily ancient two-component signaling pathway has been adapted to the needs of a eukaryote.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We consume plants either directly, or by eating animals that have been fed with plants. Therefore, life on earth would simply not be possible without plants. The calories, amino acids, vitamins and mineral ions our bodies require are taken up by plants from the environment or they are made within plant cells after uptake of some of the building blocks. Plants use these nutrients for growth and the production of edible organs such as tubers and seeds. However, abiotic stresses, including soil mineral limitation, drought and high temperature, and biotic stresses such as pathogen and insect pest attacks provide a threat to plant food production. But how can plants achieve mineral ion uptake, even under stress, and how are they able to use the nutrients and produce the tissues and organs needed for the human food supply? Plants have evolved specific membrane proteins that can sense and transfer environmental signals, as well as recognize and transport mineral ions from the outside environment into the cell. Novel scientific approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the structure and function of plant membranes, and this workshop will address important breakthroughs in membrane biology with respect to signaling, nutrient transport and plant growth. We expect that the scientific interactions will promote discussions on how to meet the challenge of feeding the global community of tomorrow and will facilitate advances essential for food security.<br/><br/>The 6th Pan American Membrane Biology Workshop will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada from June 24-28th, 2018.

This raises the intriguing possibility that, far from being hard-wired, the effects of testosterone (and other hormones) on growth and other processes may change considerably during evolution. This project will test for such ""evolutionary reversals"" in the hormonal regulation of growth across lizard species.  These species have been selected to span repeated evolutionary shifts between those in which males are larger and those in which females are larger.

Obliquely striated muscle cells are common in soft-bodied animals, occurring in members of at least 17 phyla, yet the implications of oblique striation for the function and performance of this important muscle type are unknown.  It has been assumed for decades that oblique striation permits relatively high force output over an extraordinary range of muscle lengths.  Recent work, however, suggests that the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles are very diverse, even among muscles within the same individual animal.  The project will investigate the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles from diverse animals.  This research is likely to reveal fundamental new principles of the structure and function of muscle that would otherwise remain obscure, and provide new insight into the diversity of function and the evolution of this fiber type.  The project will provide opportunities for undergraduates, especially first-generation college students and those from underrepresented backgrounds, to gain experience in physiology, biomechanics, and science communication.  In partnership with the Maine State Aquarium Discovery Center, the project will develop programs for K-12 students and the general public.  The project will also impact secondary education through collaboration with the UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC-BEST) program, which offers undergraduate Biology majors opportunities to obtain licensure as a secondary school teacher in North Carolina.<br/><br/>Although obliquely striated muscle occurs in at least 17 animal phyla, the functional implications of this striation pattern remain unclear.  Early studies suggested that oblique striation allows high force output over a much wider range of muscle lengths than possible in cross-striated muscle.  Recent work, however, shows that many obliquely striated muscles are incapable of such wide operating ranges and instead, there is considerable variation in this parameter.  The current understanding thus fails as a general explanation for the functional significance of oblique striation.  The goal of the investigation is to test a new model, based on mathematical analysis of the geometry of the myofilament array, which suggests that oblique striation evolved to allow adjustment of the length-force relationship in animals with hydrostatic skeletons.  The model predicts that the length-force relationship can be adjusted by altering the stagger angle (i.e., the degree of stagger of the myofilaments), with greater stagger resulting in a wider operating range.  Measurements of length-force properties, in vivo muscle activation and length changes, and muscle fiber ultrastructure will be used to test the model predictions and assess the functional significance of oblique striation.  The initial investigation will focus on the myofilament stagger and the length-force relationship of muscles in the squid Doryteuthis pealeii that vary widely in function and operating length range.  In addition, muscles with similar roles and length-force relationships among select taxa that span the range of Bilaterian diversity will be studied, thus identifying structural and functional convergence in obliquely striated muscles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organisms can respond by either killing invading pathogens ('resistance') or by reducing the damage caused by pathogens ('tolerance'). Among animals, resistance has been well studied, but relatively little is known about the causes and consequences of tolerance. This project focuses on a bacterial disease that emerged in the mid-1990s in a common backyard songbird, the house finch, causing rapid population declines.  This infection causes severe tissue damage, in the form of conjunctivitis (pink-eye). 'Tolerance' is likely an important way to mitigate this harmful infection. Because the disease reached parts of the house finch range at distinct times, the proposed work uses comparisons among geographically separated finch populations to uncover 1) how quickly 'tolerance' evolves in response to a novel pathogen, 2) the gene expression mechanisms important for tolerance, and 3) the consequences of 'tolerance' for disease spread within flocks. This project also crafts innovative means to communicate its scientific findings with the public. The researchers have joined a global network of science enthusiasts by founding a program that hosts monthly public events where short presentations by scientists or other experts are separated by musical or artistic interludes. Multiple events will feature results from this project. In addition, through a graduate-level course at Virginia Tech this project will train young scientists and educators to design their own programs that enhance public engagement with science.<br/><br/>Infectious diseases are among the most powerful and pervasive selective forces on the planet. Because vigorous resistance mechanisms, such as inflammatory immune responses in vertebrates, can reduce host fitness by damaging an animal's own tissues, selection should favor some degree of tolerance of infection across diverse hosts. To date, however, work on animals has focused almost exclusively on resistance.  By combining molecular techniques and inter-population comparisons, this project directly advances our knowledge of three of the most critical, open issues in the study of animal tolerance: how selection shapes this host strategy following disease emergence, the immune mechanisms underlying tolerance, and the consequences of host tolerance for pathogen transmission. The work utilizes a number of techniques to assess immune responses rarely tested in non-model organisms (e.g., expression of songbird cytokine genes through qPCR and expression of myriad other host genes through RNA-seq). In addition, this project uses experimental epidemics to link differences in individual host responses with pathogen transmission dynamics. Through this combination of comparative, molecular, and experimental techniques, this project integrates the concept of tolerance across levels of biological organization, linking the causes and consequences of this defense strategy from molecules to populations, all in a naturally occurring host-pathogen system. Ultimately, this work will significantly advance knowledge of how tolerance of infection arises in animals and how this host response impacts the dynamics of pathogen epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bats and artificial sonar, radar and communication systems all face a similar suite of problems arising from mutual interference. Explaining how bats minimize interfering with one other's sonar while flying in dense swarms or within noisy crowded roosts may help improve a wide range of artificial sensing and wireless communications systems. Bats are highly social and their exceptional resilience to jamming by conspecifics far exceeds the strategies currently employed in artificial systems. This proposal will investigate how groups of bats manage this by applying recent advances in computer networking to sonar/radar theory. The experiments outlined will characterize the behavioral strategies used by bats to improve their signaling efficiency when echolocating in groups of different sizes and across tasks of varying navigational demands.  Computer simulations will be used to identify optimum algorithm parameters and explore how these behavioral strategies manifest across a wider range biosonar conditions.  By deciphering the behavioral algorithms by which bats can cooperatively share the same acoustic space this proposal may lead to better and more efficient strategies for optimizing artificial communications network usage to support an increasingly information-based economy. This proposal will also offer unique exposure, training and educational opportunities for STEM students interested in exploring biological systems as a source of inspiration for artificial systems. In partnership with local science teachers, this proposal creates an inquiry-based dual language (Spanish/English) teaching website that will offer access for 5th/6th grade science classes to remotely interact with live animals. <br/><br/>Interference problems arise in artificial systems such as sonar and radar, wireless communications and computer network when many users attempt to transmit simultaneously over a single shared channel. Wireless communications networks partially mitigate this by employing protocols constraining user transmission rates during periods of high channel traffic to minimize interference rates between users. This proposal tests the hypothesis that echolocating bats adapt their sonar pulse emission rates to optimize sonar performance in social situations following protocols similar and applicable to international standards in wireless communications systems.  The proposal uses a combination of behavioral studies with bats in the lab and computer simulations to decode the bat's retransmission delay algorithm. First, trained bats are flown alone and in small groups of 2-5 through a sensor maze to quantify the bats' navigational performance and measure whether they systematically change pulse emission rates when performing the same task in a social context. Secondly, bats will be flown through the maze in the presence of artificial acoustic stimuli mimicking the sounds of other bats passing through the maze to test whether bats can realize a net improvement in sonar performance by decreasing their own pulse emission rates proportional to population density, counterintuitively reaping a net increase in information flow by emitting fewer pulses. Computational models of the behavioral algorithm will be developed to simulate the behavior, establish optimal parameters and precisely quantify its benefits to sonar performance in social contexts. The bat's sonar algorithms will be made available through scientific journals and Matlab-based biosonar simulation tools developed for the project will be made freely available via multiple sources on the Internet."

There is support for the idea that ROS oxidize potassium channel proteins whose function is to permit movement of potassium ions through the membranes of neurons. Potassium ion movements are involved in the propagation of action potentials by neurons.

The effects of ROS on KCNB1 channels and the impact of this process on cognitive function will be determined by studying cognitive function in aging C73A mice. Behavioral tests will be performed to see whether the lack of oxidation of KCNB1 improves the ability of mice to learn and remember new tasks. Changes in behavior will be correlated with changes in the electrical activity of the brain which will be recorded using state of the art electrophysiological techniques.

The switch-like function of CREs are encoded in the DNA sequence by short stretches of ordered bases to which proteins known as transcription factors specifically bind. Combinations of transcription factors form a ""logic"" of instructions that determines precisely which cells, and at what time the CRE can switch a gene ON. Currently, it remains poorly understood how switch-like functions are encoded in CREs and how traits evolve through changes in their encoded logic. In particular, the Hox transcription factors represent a poorly understood class that provides CREs with positional information along the major body axis. The Williams and Rebeiz labs are collaborating to study the network of genes and CREs responsible for making a male-specific body pigmentation of the fruit fly species Drosophila melanogaster. The results will inform how such pigmentation originated and was altered in multiple lineages of fruit fly species. The outcomes will show how the construction of a new characteristic is controlled by Hox genes, CREs and how evolution can operate at the level of binding sites for transcription factors. This work will provide a picture of trait evolution that will be applicable to a wide variety of animal systems. Through this research, computational tools will be refined and online learning resources will be created to aid scientists. This research project will support the future of science personnel through the participation of high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in mentored research. Participation will emphasize students from under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>The developmental events that pattern the animal body plan are regarded as a crucible for the evolution of novel traits. This project's overarching goal is to understand how body plan patterning information originated in a gene regulatory network (GRN), and was subsequently modified to diversify a morphological trait. GRNs are structured to pattern development through the binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to control gene expression. The combination of factors that bind CREs form a regulatory logic that specifies timing, pattern and levels of expression. Currently, very little is known about how GRN structure evolves to generate different phenotypes. Specifically, which genes in the hierarchy were modified, and ultimately how regulatory logic evolves. The Williams and Rebeiz labs are examining the evolution of a GRN and its underlying regulatory logic for a rapidly evolving trait present in an experimentally tractable animal system. The proposed studies will focus on male-specific patterns of abdominal pigmentation that convergently evolved in two fruit fly lineages, which were then modified and lost. The first aim will characterize how the arbiters of the body plan (e.g. Hox proteins, cofactors, and activity modulators) directly interact with CREs of the GRN to control expression patterns of pigmentation enzymes in D. melanogaster. The second aim will determine how this Hox-regulated GRN was altered in cases where pigmentation was expanded, contracted, or lost in non-model fruit fly species. The third aim will trace how this GRN independently evolved a convergent pigmentation phenotype in a non-model fly. To pursue these aims, the research team will employ techniques that include reporter transgenes in multiple fruit fly species and gel shift assays between transcription factors and CRE sequences to pinpoint phenotype altering mutations and connect these to the alterations in transcription factor binding and function that they inspired."

An open question in neuroscience is how the brain combines touch signals (sensory) with hand movements (motor) to create a unified tactile perception of an object. Because of difficulties in studying how the human brain combines these cues, researchers study rats, which use ~60 whiskers to tactually explore the environment. The whisker system is an excellent model to investigate how neurons represent and unify touch and movement, but neuroscientists currently struggle to stimulate the whiskers in a way that imitates the signals obtained during natural exploratory behavior. In this proposal, the investigators will characterize naturalistic patterns of tactile input that the rat's brain evolved to process, and will develop new mathematical tools to describe the environmental features that the rat experiences. The proposed work is scientifically important for two reasons. First, because rodents are the most commonly used animals in neuroscience, these experiments will aid researchers studying many parts of the brain involved with touch and movement. Second, these new mathematical tools will help quantify the sense of touch across species, including humans. The proposed work will have significant broader impacts on science and mathematics education and public outreach. Undergraduate students will contribute to the work, and the investigators will lead Northwestern's Robotics Club to explore engineering applications of whisker-based tactile sensing. The investigators will also continue outreach efforts through the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, and Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. <br/><br/>In the fields of vision and audition, the receptive fields of central neurons are tuned to the statistics of the ""natural scenes,- to those properties of the stimuli that the animal is likely to encounter in its natural environment. In the field of somatosensation it is challenging to quantify the natural tactile scene, in part because somatosensory signals are tightly linked to the animal's movements. The proposed work aims to begin to quantify the natural tactile scene for the rat vibrissal system by combining careful behavioral monitoring and simulations of rat head and whisker movements. The project has two major goals. The first is to characterize the statistics of the environments that the rat naturally inhabits. In Bayesian terms, this statistical distribution is called the ""prior,"" because it describes the environment's geometrical features, unbiased by the tactile sampling choices of the animal. The second is to quantify the statistics of the environment sampled by the rat, given its choices of head motions and whisk cycle. In Bayesian terms, this statistical distribution is called the ""posterior,"" because it incorporates the bias of the rat when preferentially sampling the tactile scene. This work is one of the first attempts to quantify the statistics of active touch, and it aims to make specific predictions for the receptive field properties that enable spatiotemporal integration. Equally important, this work will develop an appropriate mathematical framework for characterizing the geometry of natural scenes, an essential step towards describing active somatosensation using information theoretic measures."

Even less is known about how major transitions in color vision influence the evolution of color signals used in communication, such as the colorful displays that males use when courting females. The proposed research capitalizes on a unique opportunity to gain deeper understanding on these fronts: the repeated evolution of color vision in the spider family Salticidae, often called jumping spiders. The research program will (1) address outstanding questions about species relationships in the Salticidae, (2) use this improved understanding of species relationships to illuminate patterns of evolution in color vision, (3) quantify the genetic and functional bases of shifts in color vision, (4) test key hypotheses about the foraging benefits associated with color vision, and (5) investigate whether differences in color vision result in predictable changes to color use during signaling. Such connections have proven to be elusive in other well-studied systems (e.g. primates), but should be of widespread interest. In addition, the research team will partner with the science-media company Day's Edge Productions and a coalition of four museums led by the Cincinnati Museum Center to engage the broader public in the science of color and vision through a series of short films, a content-rich website, and a portfolio of educational activities for use in classrooms, community programming, and museum exhibit spaces. This integrated research program thus addresses key unanswered questions about how and why animals see color, while at the same time engaging the public in the process and outcomes of its discoveries.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide significant advances across a number of distinct scientific fields, and novel insights into phenotypic diversification through integration across these fields. First, the research will provide critical new phylogenetic information for understanding salticid diversity, including resolution of deep subfamily relationships and the first phylogenies for a number of species-rich sub-groups. These phylogenetic outcomes will be of broad utility to researchers studying salticid biology and the evolution of rapid radiations. Second, by characterizing the genetic basis of multiple independent transitions to true color vision, the research will provide new opportunities to understand whether color vision evolves along common pathways known from other systems (e.g., through opsin duplication) or has followed novel routes (e.g., retinal filters, as discovered recently in one salticid lineage). Third, investigations of the role that color vision plays in foraging efficiency will offer the exciting prospect of connecting differences in color vision to fitness. Finally, by connecting variation in visual function to diversity in visual signaling, this research may reveal a central role for sensory function in biodiversification. Synthesis of these multiple lines of research will offer an unprecedented view of why color vision evolves and how it shapes animal biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Caenorhabditis round worms (nematodes), self-fertile hermaphrodites have repeatedly evolved from female ancestors by acquiring the ability to make sperm in an otherwise female ovary. This developmental novelty radically alters how genes flow through populations, and greatly reduces male-male competition, with many potential downstream consequences. This project is motivated by the observations that self-fertile species have lost thousands of genes (many with roles in male reproduction), and that ancestral reproductive traits are degraded. It examines the male secreted short (mss) gene family, which appear to connect these two phenomena. MSS proteins are small, cell surface factors with an ancient role in mediating competition between sperm of different males, and were consistently lost when selfing evolved. This research serves as a case study for two relatively common phenomena in evolution. One is simplification and loss of ancestral traits. As the research unfolds, the PI will partner with informal science education professionals to bring this often counter-intuitive process to the public in two different forums. The other is the rapid evolution of genes that function in reproduction. As the sperm of both parasitic nematodes and of humans have analogous, fast-evolving proteins on their surface, the research may have eventual implications for medicine, agriculture, and human fertility. Undergraduates from groups underrepresented in science will be involved in the research and educational goals of the project.<br/> <br/>The PI and his colleagues hypothesize that relaxed selection, and possibly selection for a hermaphrodite-biased ratio, promote the loss of formerly important reproduction-related genes in self-fertile species. They also hypothesize that the MSS glycoproteins function via interactions between their post-translational carbohydrate modifications and female tissues. Four aims together will clarify the structure, function, and evolution of this intriguing family:<br/>Aim 1. Characterize the structure-function relationships of MSS proteins. Post-translational modifications of MSS proteins will be characterized, and both natural alleles and mutated transgenes will be used to infer the features of MSS proteins that are essential for their function. <br/>Aim 2. Investigate the role of MSS in sperm-sperm and sperm-female interactions. Genetics, vital dyes, and live imaging will be used to clarify how MSS proteins influence sperm competition. Attempts will also be made to identify female tissues and molecular factors that may interact with MSS. <br/>Aim 3. Characterize reproductive roles of MSS-related proteins (MSRPs) in selfing species. MSRPs are structurally similar proteins to MSS, but are found in all Caenorhabditis, regardless of mating system. MSRPs will be deleted from selfing species (which naturally already lack MSS) to determine whether they are necessary for normal fertility. <br/>Aim 4. Characterize how mss fitness interacts with mating system. We will test the hypothesis that loss of mss genes in selfing species is driven by selection for rapid population growth through experimental microcosms employing mss+ and mss- C. briggsae.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is significant because it allows plants and animals to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Developmental plasticity is an important and widespread phenomenon, however there is only limited understanding of the mechanistic basis of how external information is translated into changes in organismal development. In some cases, it is well understood how animals respond to environmental cues through production of hormones, and how these hormone signals are translated into developmental changes. What is less known, however, is how these environmentally induced hormone signals are translated into developmental changes in specific tissues. With this work, the investigators will use buckeye butterflies as a model to examine how environmental cues can coordinate tissue-specific changes in gene expression through the large-scale alteration of DNA structure. The buckeye butterfly serves as a powerful model system for studying plasticity because different populations show variation in their responses to seasonal cues, thus allowing isolation of genetic elements that control and tune plasticity in natural populations. Findings from this work will help in developing a new understanding of how environmental cues can induce developmental changes through large-scale modification of DNA structure. Such knowledge forms the basis for predicting organismal response to changing environments. Training of undergraduate and graduate students in modern biological investigations of genetic and developmental science is integral to the project. This includes the recruitment of members of under-represented groups in science. <br/><br/>Developmentally, phenotypic plasticity can be characterized as a three-part process. First, a cue such as nutrition, temperature, photoperiod, crowding, or predator presence, is sensed by the organism and then translated into an internal signal, which is often endocrine in nature. Second, cells throughout the organism receive the signal in a manner that often appears to be tissue-specific. Third, molecular machinery within cells processes and responds to the signal, resulting in changes in gene regulation, thus altering development. While the physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity has been well described in many systems, it is only in recent years that studies have started to look at the molecular and genetic mechanisms of how development responds to plasticity-inducing physiological signals. This question is particularly compelling because different tissues respond differently to signals, and the mode and degree of response of different tissues can change quickly between generations. However, it is still unclear how tissue-specific plastic phenotypes can be rapidly modulated by environmentally induced endocrine signals. With this work Reed and colleagues will study how endocrine signaling and chromatin organization interact to induce seasonal developmental plasticity in the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia. A well-characterized endocrine signal, natural genetic variation in seasonal reaction norms, and the ability to apply experimental approaches including ATAC-seq and CRISPR genome editing makes this species an ideal model to address how endocrine signaling mediates genome-wide chromatin remodeling, and how chromatin remodeling induces tissue-specific plastic phenotypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines how the dose of infection impacts the ability of beneficial bacteria to protect birds against disease, and whether beneficial bacteria on the eye can prevent or slow down the spread of this highly contagious disease within a flock of birds. Findings of this research will have important implications for understanding infectious disease outbreaks in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.  Investigators will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the use of new genomics tools to identify beneficial microbes. Using this study system and others as examples, project personnel will work with the Science Museum of Western Virginia to design a permanent, interactive 'Friendly Microbes' exhibit that illustrates the many ways that microbes benefit their hosts. Graduate students at Virginia Tech will learn how to better communicate science by assisting with the exhibit design and summer workshops associated with the exhibit. <br/><br/>How the microbiome modulates population-level disease spread depends on how symbionts function in host defense across the natural range of infectious doses, as well as how both 'donating' and 'receiving' the pathogen during transmission is modified by symbionts. This award investigates individual to population-level effects of the ocular microbiome on disease dynamics using a tractable wildlife disease system: a recently emerged conjunctival disease of house finches. Using a suite of mechanistic tools and experimental approaches, this project will: 1) test how pathogen colonization dose mediates the protective role of the resident ocular microbiome for individual finches; 2) determine how the ocular microbiome influences the likelihood of donating versus receiving a conjunctival pathogen during pairwise transmission; and 3) quantify the epidemiological impact of the host ocular microbiome on flock-level infectious disease dynamics. Researchers will examine how microbial symbionts alter both host and pathogen phenotypes relevant for transmission and reveal mechanisms of symbiont-pathogen-host interactions that are most likely to influence population-level disease dynamics. The award will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in population-wide microbiome research as well as scientific communication.

In this project, the physiological mechanisms underlying sound production across an ecologically diverse group of vocal rodents will be studied. The researchers will test the hypothesis that changes in sound production mechanisms are mediated by variation in social organization and spacing.

Organisms can respond by either killing invading pathogens ('resistance') or by reducing the damage caused by pathogens ('tolerance'). Among animals, resistance has been well studied, but relatively little is known about the causes and consequences of tolerance. This project focuses on a bacterial disease that emerged in the mid-1990s in a common backyard songbird, the house finch, causing rapid population declines.  This infection causes severe tissue damage, in the form of conjunctivitis (pink-eye). 'Tolerance' is likely an important way to mitigate this harmful infection. Because the disease reached parts of the house finch range at distinct times, the proposed work uses comparisons among geographically separated finch populations to uncover 1) how quickly 'tolerance' evolves in response to a novel pathogen, 2) the gene expression mechanisms important for tolerance, and 3) the consequences of 'tolerance' for disease spread within flocks. This project also crafts innovative means to communicate its scientific findings with the public. The researchers have joined a global network of science enthusiasts by founding a program that hosts monthly public events where short presentations by scientists or other experts are separated by musical or artistic interludes. Multiple events will feature results from this project. In addition, through a graduate-level course at Virginia Tech this project will train young scientists and educators to design their own programs that enhance public engagement with science.<br/><br/>Infectious diseases are among the most powerful and pervasive selective forces on the planet. Because vigorous resistance mechanisms, such as inflammatory immune responses in vertebrates, can reduce host fitness by damaging an animal's own tissues, selection should favor some degree of tolerance of infection across diverse hosts. To date, however, work on animals has focused almost exclusively on resistance.  By combining molecular techniques and inter-population comparisons, this project directly advances our knowledge of three of the most critical, open issues in the study of animal tolerance: how selection shapes this host strategy following disease emergence, the immune mechanisms underlying tolerance, and the consequences of host tolerance for pathogen transmission. The work utilizes a number of techniques to assess immune responses rarely tested in non-model organisms (e.g., expression of songbird cytokine genes through qPCR and expression of myriad other host genes through RNA-seq). In addition, this project uses experimental epidemics to link differences in individual host responses with pathogen transmission dynamics. Through this combination of comparative, molecular, and experimental techniques, this project integrates the concept of tolerance across levels of biological organization, linking the causes and consequences of this defense strategy from molecules to populations, all in a naturally occurring host-pathogen system. Ultimately, this work will significantly advance knowledge of how tolerance of infection arises in animals and how this host response impacts the dynamics of pathogen epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitin ligases are enzymes that chemically couple the small polypeptide ubiquitin to other proteins to regulate their function or mark them for destruction. Ubiquitin tagging controls a wide range of key cellular processes such as cell division and cell fate decisions during development. Consequently, certain ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in many human diseases including cancer. Most animals have a large number of ubiquitin ligases (approximately 600 in humans), however, we know very little about the biological functions or specific protein targets for the majority of these enzymes. This project investigates the role of ubiquitin ligases in stem cell-based tissue regeneration using planarian flatworms as model organisms. These animals possess a large population of pluripotent stem cells that bestow upon them the remarkable ability to regenerate all of their tissues after injury or amputation. This research will identify genes encoding ubiquitin ligases in planarians and analyze their function in tissue renewal using a combination of genetic, molecular, and microscopy approaches. These experiments will reveal ubiquitin ligase genes that are required for various aspects of regeneration. The ability to inhibit ubiquitin ligase gene function in the animal will be combined with technologies designed to identify alterations in proteins modified with ubiquitin. This work will contribute to the broad goal of understanding the biological roles of ubiquitin ligases and identifying cellular targets required for stem cell regulation, tissue regeneration or body patterning.<br/><br/>Dr. Zayas is an investigator and educator at San Diego State University (SDSU), a Hispanic Serving Institution. This project will develop a laboratory course that will integrate undergraduate students with the research outlined here. Special attention will be given to recruiting students underrepresented in science to enroll in the course. These students will be mentored on how to prepare for diverse scientific careers to support efforts to broaden participation in STEM fields. The educational activities of this proposal include science outreach at local K-12 schools to help spark enthusiasm for biology in the community."

The proposed research seeks to answer the question, ""What are the costs of immunity?""  This is a central question in the field of ecological immunology. A simplifying assumption is often made that a greater or longer-lasting immune response is advantageous.  However, the costs of a more robust immune response may negatively affect other energy intensive processes such as reproduction. Currently, much of immunology research focuses on specific, isolated cellular components of the immune system. Although this level of understanding is important, it is also critical to comprehend how an overall immune response can affect the condition of an individual, including other vital physiological systems. Furthermore, it is presently unclear how individual measures, such as immunity, affect population changes over time. Understanding the link between individuals and populations will allow us to monitor more effectively the health and viability of natural populations, many of which are susceptible to an ever-changing landscape and climate. To address these knowledge gaps the proposed work will test (1) the energetic costs of immunity; (2) the effects of the immune system on other key physiological processes, notably reproduction; and (3) the links between individual immunity and natural populations.  Finally, embedded within the research program is a research-based training initiative for future educators, which will incorporate those educators into the proposed scientific research. By providing opportunities for future educators to ?do science,? this research will enhance the educational experiences and understanding of the scientific process for educators and for their students. The impacts of this educational program even in its initial stages will be broad, because there is an inherent multiplier effect. In sum, the proposed research and educational program has the capability to transform the principles underlying immunological research and to enhance the science education curriculum both for future instructors and for their students."

The research scope of the project addresses a unique connection between the cellular stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins, and the plant immune system. Upon pathogen attack, plant cells increase production of new peptides, which consequently puts a burden on the protein folding machinery in the ER and causes cellular stress. Through this project, the investigators will learn about the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficient alleviation of this stress response in Arabidopsis. The insights gained from this research will impact the agricultural sciences by elucidating mechanisms to develop crop plants with the capacity to function under increased cellular stress - a necessity for a more sustainable future.<br/>Situated in Birmingham, AL, a city that has one of the most diverse and impoverished populations nationwide (74% African American, 25% below the poverty line), the investigators are in a unique position to foster plant biology-related education through outreach programs for underrepresented and socioeconomically underprivileged minorities. The investigators will implement an integrative service- and discovery-based learning outreach platform ""OUTPACE"" (OUTreach plant PAthology Clinic & Education) that is directed towards undergraduate students and citizen scientists: low-income urban gardening families of the local Community Gardens. OUTPACE will enable the students to acquire laboratory- and field-based knowledge of plant immunity and assist community growers in diagnosing plant diseases. These efforts are well aligned with current regional initiatives to enhance civic engagement and sustainable living, and combat urban malnutrition and hunger. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/>Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) is a highly conserved eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor. While chronic ER stress is linked with metazoan immune disorders, the role of IRE1a in plant immunity remains elusive. Recently, the principal investigator established the first known connection between the IRE1a and its client mRNA for the bZIP60 transcription factor in Arabidopsis immune signaling. Based on these findings, the investigators will expand their research questions to other key areas of ER signaling in plant immunity and address the following objectives: 1) Understanding the molecular mechanisms of biotic stress-dependent IRE1a activation and deactivation under oscillating ER stress conditions; 2) Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of IRE1a functions in cellular adaptation or pathogen-mediated cell death; 3) Deciphering the feedback mechanisms between IRE1a and the salicylic acid receptor NPR1; 4) Genome-wide discovery and characterization of novel IRE1a substrates. To achieve these goals, the investigators will employ well-established and newly developed methodologies, including: mutant/transgenic plants studies, in planta fluorescent reporter-based microscopy, pathogen infections and cell death assays, protein-protein interaction and enzymatic assays, a novel yeast reporter-based system, transcriptional profiling, and bioinformatics-aided analyses."

The lead investigator and collaborators have discovered a new type of lignin, apparently restricted to the seed coats of a range of non-crop species. This new type of lignin has significant promise for conversion to carbon fibers. If this type of lignin could be engineered into bioenergy feedstocks, it would represent a high value co-product of biorefining. This project will determine the biochemical pathway by which this new type of lignin is synthesized, and the steps that will need to be taken to make it accumulate in the stems and leaves of plants. Understanding the limitations to the accumulation of different types of lignin in different plant tissue and cell types also addresses a fundamental problem in cell biology. This project uses a range of approaches from genetic mechanisms through metabolic engineering to production and testing of biomaterials. Outreach activities will target two demographically distinct groups; highly talented high school students at the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, and mathematics and science public school teachers with primarily Hispanic students who are Limited English Proficient (LEP). Teachers will develop curricular activities in Spanish and English to implement in their classrooms. The project will include informal learning activities through deployment of the projects to encourage K-12 girls into STEM through outreach with the Dallas Society of Women Engineers.<br/><br/>During lignin biosynthesis, the monolignol precursors are functionalized by aromatic hydroxylation and O-methylation to generate, successively, hydroxyphenyl (H), catechyl (C), guaiacyl (G), 5-hydroxyguaiacyl (5-OH-G), and syringyl (S) units. Natural lignins in angiosperms consist of approximately equal amounts of G and S units, with less than 2% of H units and no C or 5-OH-G units; gymnosperm lignins are similar but lack S units. 5-OH-G units are incorporated into lignins in transgenic plants in which the second methylation step is blocked, but C-units have not been reported to accumulate in the lignin of angiosperms in which the first methylation step is similarly blocked. The Principal Investigators have shown that the seed coats of a wide range of dicot and monocot plants contain a novel type of lignin (C-lignin) derived totally from catechyl units. This linear polymer has advantageous properties for conversion to carbon fibers. However, C-lignin appears to be restricted to seed coats in nature.  This award will address two major questions: what is the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of C-lignin in plant seed coats, and why does C-lignin not occur naturally in the vegetative tissues of the plant? The researchers hypothesize that C-lignin biosynthesis involves loss of function of one or both methylation steps in classical monolignol biosynthesis, and will determine how this happens using transcriptome profiling in developing seeds of Cleome hassleriana, in which there is an abrupt transition from G lignin to C lignin biosynthesis at around 13 days post-pollination. Addressing the second question will involve attempting to introduce the C-lignin polymer into different tissues of the model legume Medicago truncatula, utilizing existing mutants in which enzymes of lignin methylation have been functionally disrupted.  These studies aim to determine the potential for engineering accumulation of C-lignin in vegetative tissues in sufficient yields to enable industrial processing, and, in this context, improved methods for extraction of C-lignin from both seeds and vegetative tissues will be developed, and the physical properties of the polymer further analyzed."

How such coordination is orchestrated is not well understood, but the consequences of losing nerve cells that are vital for locomotion, for example, during a spinal cord injury, are strikingly clear.  This project examines how the nervous system can be retuned after a significant perturbation or injury to regain its former ability to generate rhythmic patterns of locomotion.  Such reorganization addresses an emerging and highly significant problem in the neurosciences -that of understanding the cellular mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity.  Essentially, this plasticity enables a system to go back to its set point or regain its original operational status after a perturbation.  Currently, very little is known about locomotor-related homeostatic mechanisms.  To understand such events, at the level of individual neurons, this project will use a combination of cellular, molecular and behavioral methods to study how a recovering nervous system achieves its transformation.   <br/><br/>The scientific team has chosen to study the medicinal leech as a model of locomotor control and homeostatic plasticity because of its experimental accessibility and well-studied locomotor circuits. Its central pattern generators (CPGs) for crawling behavior have been shown to be regulated by dopamine, a universal modulator of motor activity in most animals; each of these CPGs is located within each and every segmental ganglion comprising the nerve cord.  The compelling aspect of this project is discovering how the crawl CPGs become retuned or reconfigured so that all timing events are fully restored without the physical reconnection of cephalic inputs.  Three hypotheses will be tested: 1) proprioceptive inputs from the body wall substitute for brain-specific timing events; 2) the CPG in the ganglion immediately below the site of nerve cord injury takes the lead in initiating and directing the metachronal crawl waves in the caudal direction; 3) changes in gene expression patterns in the lead CPG provide for a lower crawl-activation threshold to DA and/or proprioceptive inputs.  Experimental methods will include electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, confocal imaging, behavioral video-capture, computational neuroscience, and cutting-edge single-cell quantitative PCR. This project's outcomes have potential to impact disparate fields outside of the biological sciences, including physics, math, computer science and engineering.  The planned development of a leech transcriptome will also propel the medicinal leech model into the era of genomics. The project will support the training of female and minority participants, several leech-based laboratory teaching modules, and community outreach projects involving a leech Critter-Cam for middle school students."

This project will explore a gene expression mechanism by which ethylene regulates such processes, thereby providing novel insights into ethylene signaling and regulation as well as avenues by which to modify ethylene responses in agriculturally important plants.

This project presents an integrated set of experiments to determine how the type-B ARRs function in concert with the EIN3 family of TFs, building toward a systems level understanding of the ethylene transcriptional response. The first objective of this project is to characterize the role of physical interaction between type-B ARRs and EIN3 in transcriptional regulation. Mechanistic studies will be pursued to elucidate the basis for the interaction and how this interaction affects ethylene-dependent gene regulation. The second objective is to determine the suite of genes co-regulated by type-B ARRs and EIN3. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq based approaches will be used to identify the co-regulated targets, and systems-based approaches used to predict physiological roles for testing. The third objective is to characterize transcriptional cross-talk between the ethylene and cytokinin signaling pathways, since employment of two-component signaling elements by the ethylene pathway is predicted to affect signaling through the cytokinin pathway. Models for how TF cooperativity and sequestration regulate cross-talk between these phytohormone signaling pathways will be tested using transcriptomic and genetic approaches."

Scientists know a great deal about how TTX normally blocks neural activity, but not much about how animals that possess TTX are able to resist its effects. The ability of newts to resist TTX is particularly puzzling because several of their genes must be mutated in concert - a mutation in only one affected gene would leave the newt vulnerable to TTX's affects, and likely dead. Strangely, newts are not simply resistant to TTX's effects, but are actually attracted to the smell of TTX. In the proposed work, scientists will use well-established methods to quantify the distribution of TTX inside newts' bodies, identify mutations that are likely involved in TTX resistance, examine the effects of TTX on their neurons, and discover how the neurons involved in smelling are activated by TTX. This basic research will help scientists understand how neurons work at a molecular level, as well as how animals adapt to the presence of toxins. Through teaching and training activities associated with this work, the proposed project will also contribute to the development of a science-literate American workforce.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>TTX is toxic because it blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. The proposed work will identify where the different forms of NaVs are expressed in neurons and muscles in newts, specific mutations in these channels that allow them to resist the toxic effects of TTX, and how these structural changes alter neuron function. Using analytical chemistry, histochemistry, and molecular biology, levels of TTX in different tissues as well as the location and structure of the six different NaVs will be examined in both highly toxic and non-toxic newts to quantify levels of TTX resistance and identify mutations that confer resistance. The electrophysiological properties of NaVs in a heterologous expression system and of neurons in the brain of newts will be characterized to determine whether and how TTX resistance alters channel and neuron function. In addition, the adaptations underlying TTX detection in the olfactory epithelium will be identified to understand how this unusual ability evolved. The proposed work will contribute to understanding a physiologically vital class of ion channels, as well as the ways in which evolution at the molecular level shapes nervous system function and animal behavior, both fundamental questions in neuroscience. In addition, the proposed work will immerse undergraduate students in the nature and practice of science, particularly through the involvement of Williamette University students in an REU program at Michigan State University."

This process, called light adaptation, involves a change in the sensitivity of neurons in the retina of the eye. Although retinal adaptation to brighter light levels is a crucial function of the visual system, the changes that happen in the retina to enable this adaptation are not well understood. Previous work has suggested that release of the chemical dopamine from retinal neurons is responsible for light adaptation, but the details of how this works are not clear. This study will determine what changes are occurring in the retina to allow adaptation to increasing light levels and determine how dopamine is changing visual signaling. Additionally, since the retina is an easily accessible part of the brain, these experiments can be used as a model for how dopamine changes the responses of groups of neurons. Dopamine signaling is important throughout the brain and in disorders such as Parkinson's disease. As part of this research, educational materials will also be developed with students to explain how light adaptation works and the importance of this process for normal vision. These materials will be used to increase interest in science for high school students, many of whom are underrepresented in science, and the public through outreach at a yearly festival and web interactions. <br/><br/>Light adaptation is a crucial retinal signaling mechanism that allows the visual system to avoid saturation by resetting the gain of neuronal signaling. Light adaptation also increases visual acuity by increasing the response of ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, to small light stimuli. Inhibition of bipolar cells, which relay information to ganglion cells, influences ganglion cell spatial resolution. Therefore, light adaptation modulation of bipolar cell inhibition could increase visual acuity. However, the role of inhibition in light adaptation is not known. Modulation of inhibition may be especially important to adaptation of the retinal pathway that responds to the offset of light (OFF), as inhibitory inputs to OFF-bipolar cells switch between dim light rod and bright light cone sources and light adaptation decreases the spatial extent of inhibition to OFF-bipolar cells. This suggests a model where light adaptation narrowing of bipolar cell inhibition underlies the changes in ganglion cell spatial signaling. It is unknown how narrowing of OFF-bipolar cell inhibition will affect OFF-ganglion cell signaling or what mechanisms underlie the OFF-bipolar cell changes. Dopamine is a key neuromodulator of retinal light adaptation. Dopamine-mediated uncoupling of gap junctions and/or increases in inhibitory connections between upstream neurons might narrow OFF-bipolar cell inhibition. However, the role of dopamine modulation of physiological inhibition is not known. These proposed mechanisms for light adaptation of OFF pathway inhibition and their effects on retinal acuity will be tested using a combination of single-cell electrophysiology, morphology, genetic mouse models and optogenetic activation of retinal neurons."

Despite their ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how habits are formed and maintained in the brain.  This research project will study how habits are represented in brain activity and how changing that activity can change habits.  Science generally lacks an understanding of how fluctuating patterns of brain activity control behaviors like habits because, until recently, tools were not available to manipulate those brain patterns.  Using cutting-edge techniques to do so, this work tests a central hypothesis that habits are controlled by the timing of brain activity related to when a habit is initiated and executed.  Specifically, prior studies have uncovered a burst of brain activity as a behavior starts that correlates with how habitual the behavior is.  This research evaluates how this pattern arises in the brain and whether it controls how habitual a behavior is by using tools to both monitor and manipulate the brain at the sub-second time-scale.  Results will provide a rich understanding of how habits arise out of precisely timed bursts of brain activity.  As part of this project, the cutting-edge research techniques are taught to undergraduate neuroscience students, which is a vital but lacking ingredient in their education.  These techniques, and the brain basis of habits in general, also are taught to grade-schools and the public through outreach activities to convey progress science is making on understanding habits.  Underrepresented individuals participate in all aspects of the research and outreach.<br/><br/>In the brain, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and its dopamine input from the substantia nigra have long been implicated in habits.  Neural recording studies have uncovered an activity pattern in these areas that characterizes habits, which involves a spiking burst at the start of behavior and diminished spiking mid-behavior.  These dynamics suggest that it is the timing of brain activity that helps dictate whether or not a learned behavior occurs habitually.  To test this, rats are exposed to lever-pressing and maze-running tasks that provide a screen of behavioral measures for habits.  Activity in the DLS is recorded using electrodes as animals form habits and then modify them.  Using optogenetics, in which DLS activity can be manipulated using pulses of light, the strength of the DLS activity is manipulated and consequences on habitual behavior and ongoing DLS dynamics assessed.  The first and second objectives are to test if the strength of DLS activity at the start of a behavior is sufficient and necessary for that behavior to be expressed as a habit and for habit-related DLS activity to be maintained over time.  The third objective is to test if start-related activity of dopamine input to the DLS is also critical for habits and for the start-related DLS activity that represents habits.  Collectively, this work answers a long-standing question of how step-to-step fluctuations in DLS activity guide a behavior towards habitual expression and will merge isolated behavioral and neuroscience approaches to do so."

Recent studies have shown that many animals, from butterflies to chimpanzees, can protect themselves against parasites through self-medication (the use of anti-parasitic substances or diets). However, the mechanisms by which medication behaviors reduce parasite infection and disease remain poorly understood. This project focuses on monarch butterflies and their protozoan parasites. Monarch caterpillars are specialist feeders on milkweed plants, and milkweeds vary in their concentrations and toxicity of chemicals called cardenolides. When feeding on toxic milkweed, monarchs become less sick, and infected female butterflies preferentially lay their eggs on toxic milkweed to reduce disease in their offspring. This project will determine whether toxic milkweeds reduce disease by directly killing parasites, by increasing the immune response of monarchs, or by providing monarchs with a gut flora that prevents parasite infection. Beyond monarch butterflies, this project has broad relevance to other animals, many of which use medicinal plants. The parasites studied here are related to parasites causing disease in agricultural animals and humans, thus elucidating the anti-parasitic activity of milkweed chemicals could have future applications for treating disease. The project will also integrate research with education, by training graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups in science.

Such defenses may have important consequences for the evolution of physiological immunity, but research on the interplay between physiological immunity, behavioral immunity and microbial protection remains scarce. This project will study the interaction between monarch butterflies, their milkweed host plants and their protozoan parasites to address three hypotheses: (1) behavioral use of medicinal milkweeds directly decreases parasite infection, rendering physiological immunity superfluous and reducing investment in such immune mechanisms; (2) medicinal milkweeds do not reduce monarch immunity but instead exert their protective effects by enhancing physiological immune responses; and (3) medicinal milkweeds modulate monarch midgut microbiota to a state that confers resistance to parasite infection. These hypotheses will be addressed by elucidating immune responses differentially mounted upon infection of butterflies from resistant and susceptible populations, comparing anti-parasite immune responses in monarchs fed on medicinal and non-medicinal milkweed plants, and by analyzing the effects of milkweed secondary and nutritional chemicals on monarch immunity and resistance. In addition, comparison of the midgut microbiota of monarchs reared on medicinal and non-medicinal milkweeds will be coupled with experiments manipulating gut microbiota to test for the effect of medicinal milkweed microbial communities on monarch resistance to infection. The researchers will use a combination of fieldwork, controlled experiments and next generation sequencing technology, including the use of RNASeq to quantify differential immune responses and MiSeq to quantify bacterial and fungal caterpillar gut communities."

This ability allows the painted turtle to overwinter in oxygen-depleted, ice-covered ponds in the wild. To understand the underlying mechanisms, this research uses the recently sequenced painted turtle genome to determine the gene expression changes that occur during anoxia and to relate them to the physiological changes that are already known to occur. It focuses on the turtle's heart, which, in other vertebrates, is extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation, including humans. It also focuses on development, because hatchling turtles are less tolerant of anoxia than adults. This research also explores processes related to the handling of the massive lactic acid loads, which accumulate to levels higher than seen in any other animal.

A major constraint to this goal is crop losses due to microbial plant diseases which destroy approximately 15% of the world's total crop production every year. Advances in the science of plant disease control are needed to reduce crop losses to disease. Plant genomes encode thousands of genes involved in disease resistance, called the plant immune system. For some crops, modern science has made rapid progress in identifying disease resistance genes and using them in plant breeding, but for others such as long-lived tree crops, it is much more difficult to make rapid progress. This project will explore the plant immune system via a comprehensive study of the genes important for disease resistance to key pathogens of an important crop, cacao, which is the source of chocolate, and an important cash crop for millions of farmers in developing countries. The methods, tools and knowledge gained will be directly applicable to discovery of genes underlying important traits in other crops, especially trees and many perennial grasses. In addition to contributing to building a global partnership in reaching the goals of feeding a growing population sustainably, this project will involve students and young scientists in the US and in developing countries though international exchanges and collaborations.<br/><br/>This project will establish a new approach for use with perennial crop plants to identify candidate loci for disease resistance using a model tree crop, Theobroma cacao (the chocolate tree). Whole genome re-sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of a core collection of highly diverse cacao genotypes will provide the genetic information necessary to drive the discovery of genes critical for pathogen resistance. Functional analysis of these genes will test their role in resistance and set the stage for future translation of these basic findings to guiding more efficient breeding programs utilizing a wider array of genetic diversity. Importantly, the methods, tools, and knowledge gained will be directly applicable to discovery of genes underlying important traits in other crops, especially heterozygous perennials such as trees and many grasses which are not particularly amenable to approaches developed for the major annual crops such as corn and soybean. The basic evolutionary and functional principles that will be discovered can be generalized to most if not all crop plants. To promote and build genomics research capacity in developing countries and to promote inter-disciplinary cross-training the project will support scientific exchanges between project members and foreign collaborators, through postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student training at multiple institutions and will involve students from minority serving institutions. The results of this study will be made publicly available through electronic resources and publications."

Missing from these efforts is the pursuit of epigenetic variation, whereby stably inherited traits arise in the absence of genetic changes. It was recently discovered that clonal propagation of plants can induce epigenetic variation that is stably inherited in clonally regenerated plants. The goal of this project is to use this newly developed approach that couples a variety of environmental stresses with traditional plant clonal propagation techniques to produce maize plants with enhanced stress resistance. This project is a joint collaboration between the Schmitz Laboratory at the University of Georgia and the Gutierrez-Marcos Laboratory at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and is supported as part of the Breakthrough Technologies competition, which is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The ability to uncover stress-responsive variation using this novel, clonal plant propagation strategy could lead to a rapid improvement of stress resilient maize varieties. In addition to the agricultural impact, this project will fund graduate student training in experimental and computational biology. The graduate students will participate in mentoring high-school summer intern students from the Young Dawgs program sponsored by the University of Georgia. These students will focus on biological computer programming. Additionally, hands-on workshops for experimental biology will be hosted at the University of Warwick through the Nuffield Foundation Research Program to inspire students and teachers to explore the area of plant biotechnology. <br/><br/>This project aims to create Zea mays plants with enhanced responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. To accomplish this goal, a novel method to clonally regenerate maize plants in concert with different stress conditions to induce novel yet heritable epigenetic variation will be used. Transcriptome analyses will be performed to assess the functional significance of the stress-induced epigenetic variation a transcriptome analysis on regenerated plants. For the induced epigenetic variation to be relevant it must be stable over generations. Therefore, the stability of induced epigenetic variation by studying the DNA methylome and transcriptome of progeny plants derived from clonal regenerants will be assessed. In parallel, phenotypic characterization of the regenerant plants and their progeny in comparison to controls will be carried out to determine if enhanced responses to stress exist. These results will potentially lead to novel methodologies for inducing novel yet stable epigenetic variation, thus enabling innovative avenues for trait improvement in maize and possibly other crop species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although recorded in many settings, these potentials are poorly understood.  Yet, they are clinically important; for instance, they are used for diagnosis of epilepsy and early detection of deafness. Development of differential diagnostic tools depends on understanding what brain components contribute to the recorded potentials. The investigators use a combination of quantitative modeling and recordings from the auditory system of the Barn Owl to gain insight into the connection between field potentials and their neuronal generators.  In addition to better understanding of a widely used diagnostic tool, a further societally relevant outcome of the project lies in training women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The U.S. and the German laboratories in this international collaboration have a strong commitment to science education and a well-established track record of training research fellows, as well as high school students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>Extracellular field potentials are typically generated by various neuronal sources, making their interpretation difficult. They are, however, clinically important, with applications ranging from diagnostics to brain-computer interfaces. In the auditory system, for example, the auditory evoked potential, also called the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is widely used for newborn hearing screening but little is known how specific nuclei contribute to it structure. Motivated by clinical relevance and theoretical importance of understanding extracellular field potentials, the international team applies a combined computational and neurophysiological investigation of the extracellular field potential in a bird model system. The targeted neural structure, the Nucleus Laminaris in the Barn Owl, is homogeneous and well organized, and allows direct access to a system with a large extracellular field potential. The investigators' models and experiments delineate the potential contributions of the three possible sources of the extracellular field potentials. The approach tightly integrates theory and experiments, to provide a fundamental understanding of the connection between the extracellular field potentials and their neuronal generators. The results from this collaborative cross-disciplinary effort will provide a basis for the interpretation of the clinically relevant ABR.

To engineer plants effectively, genes must be first inserted into DNA and then plants containing the new DNA must be grown to maturity. For many plants, these steps of transformation  must be overcome in order to study gene function and to engineer crops for genetic improvements. This project uses advanced DNA sequence databases, imaging, and computational methods to map the genes that control the process of regeneration and transformation needed for genetic engineering. The project develops new and more efficient image acquisition and analysis software that will enable scientists in many fields to study plant regeneration and related processes more rapidly and precisely. At the same time, the project is developing a program to educate high school teachers and students about the foundation of genetics and genomics as an important step to communicate effectively about genetically engineered crops and food. Educational modules will contribute to teacher curricula in partnership with the Science & Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program at Oregon State University as part of an extensive STEM network of high school teachers and students in rural and underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>Regeneration of differentiated organisms from single cells is a critical need for functional genomics and for the production of genetically engineered organisms. The project will conduct a genome-wide investigation of the genes that control regenerability and transformation (RT) in Populus, which is one of the best studied crop species with respect to these traits. Extensive genomic resources for Populus will be leveraged, including rich transcriptome databases, a high-quality reference genome, and a fully resequenced genome-wide association study (GWAS) population of 1,084 undomesticated genotypes with extremely low levels of linkage disequilibrium. The value of the GWAS population for gene identification for a variety of traits, including those related to in vitro regeneration, has already been established. The project will identify genetic elements that control RT, develop novel phenomic methods based on image analysis, and develop new social science and education methods for teaching about genetic engineering to diverse high school students and teachers. The specific objectives are to (1) explore a variety of RT methods to maximize variation in RT responses; (2) develop new phenomic tools, including an image capture and generalizable machine-vision system, to precisely determine in vitro phenotypes; (3) using GWAS, map sets of alleles that are associated with variation in RT frequency; and (4) study cognitive processes with respect to GE crops, develop case studies and new teaching materials, deliver them to rural and underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest, and through publications, social media, and conferences share the project?s insights and teaching modules  internationally."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joseph Kieber.<br/><br/>Cytokinins are plant hormones that are known to regulate various aspects of growth and development and other physiological processes in plants. The overarching goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding into how cytokinin regulates these processes by using an integrative transcriptomic and genomic approach to build a dynamic model of the cytokinin response in rice. These new insights may provide new effective strategies to engineer this signaling pathway to modify various agronomical traits in rice needed to meet the future food supply and demand. The broader impacts of the project consist of training undergraduate and graduate students, assisting the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center with a series of workshops designed for UNC graduate students, and participating in the North Carolina DNA Day, which is an annual event where North Carolina researchers from various institutions advocate careers in science and biotechnology and give biology lessons to high schools throughout North Carolina.

Genetic technologies have led to better predictive models for plant breeding and introduction of novel traits into crops that could not be added by conventional means. However, the ability to introduce novel traits using biotechnology is often hampered by low efficiencies. This project seeks to improve the efficiency with which Agrobacterium tumefaciens can serve as a tool to introduce novel traits into crop plants by exploiting the bacterium's ability to secrete proteins into plant cells. The transient delivery of these proteins will impact both the ability of the plant cell to detect and fight off the bacterium, and the ability of the plant cell  to regenerate a new plant once it has been altered. To meet this goal, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken that brings together expertise in genetics, microbiology and molecular biology. Importantly, the underlying biology of the project will be communicated through outreach efforts to the non-science community on all aspects of food production and on how innovations in agriculture help maintain the U. S. strategic advantage through its capacity to produce a plentiful and safe food supply. <br/><br/>The research to be conducted in this project lays out an innovative set of studies to design and test novel Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains that can help mitigate two major inefficiencies of plant transformation: the competency of the cell to receive a genetic reagent and the ability of that same cell to lead to germline transmission of the induced genetic change.  Pseudomonas effector proteins that suppress the plant innate immune response will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of gene transfer from bacterium to plant cell.  In addition, plant morphogenic proteins will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of regenerating plants from transformed tissue culture cells.  The results of these studies will also provide insight into the size limit of a protein that can be shuttled through the Agrobacterium type IV secretion system. Overall, this project should lead to A. tumefaciens strains with enhanced transformation capacity across a broader array of genotypes within a plant species and that are easily transferable to the plant science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even less is known about how major transitions in color vision influence the evolution of color signals used in communication, such as the colorful displays that males use when courting females. The proposed research capitalizes on a unique opportunity to gain deeper understanding on these fronts: the repeated evolution of color vision in the spider family Salticidae, often called jumping spiders. The research program will (1) address outstanding questions about species relationships in the Salticidae, (2) use this improved understanding of species relationships to illuminate patterns of evolution in color vision, (3) quantify the genetic and functional bases of shifts in color vision, (4) test key hypotheses about the foraging benefits associated with color vision, and (5) investigate whether differences in color vision result in predictable changes to color use during signaling. Such connections have proven to be elusive in other well-studied systems (e.g. primates), but should be of widespread interest. In addition, the research team will partner with the science-media company Day's Edge Productions and a coalition of four museums led by the Cincinnati Museum Center to engage the broader public in the science of color and vision through a series of short films, a content-rich website, and a portfolio of educational activities for use in classrooms, community programming, and museum exhibit spaces. This integrated research program thus addresses key unanswered questions about how and why animals see color, while at the same time engaging the public in the process and outcomes of its discoveries.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide significant advances across a number of distinct scientific fields, and novel insights into phenotypic diversification through integration across these fields. First, the research will provide critical new phylogenetic information for understanding salticid diversity, including resolution of deep subfamily relationships and the first phylogenies for a number of species-rich sub-groups. These phylogenetic outcomes will be of broad utility to researchers studying salticid biology and the evolution of rapid radiations. Second, by characterizing the genetic basis of multiple independent transitions to true color vision, the research will provide new opportunities to understand whether color vision evolves along common pathways known from other systems (e.g., through opsin duplication) or has followed novel routes (e.g., retinal filters, as discovered recently in one salticid lineage). Third, investigations of the role that color vision plays in foraging efficiency will offer the exciting prospect of connecting differences in color vision to fitness.

Even less is known about how major transitions in color vision influence the evolution of color signals used in communication, such as the colorful displays that males use when courting females. The proposed research capitalizes on a unique opportunity to gain deeper understanding on these fronts: the repeated evolution of color vision in the spider family Salticidae, often called jumping spiders. The research program will (1) address outstanding questions about species relationships in the Salticidae, (2) use this improved understanding of species relationships to illuminate patterns of evolution in color vision, (3) quantify the genetic and functional bases of shifts in color vision, (4) test key hypotheses about the foraging benefits associated with color vision, and (5) investigate whether differences in color vision result in predictable changes to color use during signaling. Such connections have proven to be elusive in other well-studied systems (e.g. primates), but should be of widespread interest. In addition, the research team will partner with the science-media company Day's Edge Productions and a coalition of four museums led by the Cincinnati Museum Center to engage the broader public in the science of color and vision through a series of short films, a content-rich website, and a portfolio of educational activities for use in classrooms, community programming, and museum exhibit spaces. This integrated research program thus addresses key unanswered questions about how and why animals see color, while at the same time engaging the public in the process and outcomes of its discoveries.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide significant advances across a number of distinct scientific fields, and novel insights into phenotypic diversification through integration across these fields. First, the research will provide critical new phylogenetic information for understanding salticid diversity, including resolution of deep subfamily relationships and the first phylogenies for a number of species-rich sub-groups. These phylogenetic outcomes will be of broad utility to researchers studying salticid biology and the evolution of rapid radiations. Second, by characterizing the genetic basis of multiple independent transitions to true color vision, the research will provide new opportunities to understand whether color vision evolves along common pathways known from other systems (e.g., through opsin duplication) or has followed novel routes (e.g., retinal filters, as discovered recently in one salticid lineage). Third, investigations of the role that color vision plays in foraging efficiency will offer the exciting prospect of connecting differences in color vision to fitness.

This metaphor describes situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the cause and which should be considered the effect. There exists a similar question in biology during early animal development. Animal development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the resulting fertilized egg creates a single cell with enormous differential potential because it is able to develop into all cell types. In frogs, within the first few hours after fertilization, a fertilized egg divides several times and develops into three cell types with distinct functions. These differentiated cells express different genes. The dilemma here is - What regulates the gene expression to give the cell identity? One idea is that DNA-binding proteins are the major drivers and these directly control gene expression. In this scenario, the expression patterns of the DNA-binding proteins are critical. Another idea is that the early embryonic DNA is very restrictive and only limited regions of DNA are accessible to DNA-binding proteins. Thus, the configuration of DNA is important. This project will address which of these two models is important. A combination of cutting edge technologies will be applied during the course of this research. In addition, this project has an outreach component, and will train undergraduates to become familiar with the latest science concepts and technology affecting biomedical sciences. <br/><br/>The activation of gene transcription in the embryo relies on maternal transcription factors, which sit high in the regulatory hierarchy to coordinate the gene regulatory cascades that lead to stereotypical development of embryos. The goal of this project is to examine the earliest lineage restriction events of germ layer specification (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) using Xenopus and to address how maternal transcription factors regulate embryonic genome programming. Since transcription factors drive gene expression programs by binding Cis-Regulatory Modules (CRMs) dispersed throughout the genome, a major unanswered question is how maternal transcription factors bind specific CRMs to endow the transcriptional responses. This important question can be addressed by going back to the earliest stages of embryonic development when transcription from the embryonic genome has not yet begun, the number of different cell types is small, and the genome appears relatively na?ve. Three maternal transcription factors (Otx1, VegT and Sox7) were recently identified and shown to be involved in endoderm specification. Using a combination of genomic approaches together with genetic methods, both gain- and loss-of-function mutants of these maternal transcription factors will be analyzed to determine the mechanisms by which individual CRM activities are coordinately activated, and ensure subsequent epigenetic modifications of the genome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most of these model species, males also happen to be larger than females. However, in several lizard species in which females are larger, testosterone inhibits growth. This raises the intriguing possibility that, far from being hard-wired, the effects of testosterone (and other hormones) on growth and other processes may change considerably during evolution. This project will test for such ""evolutionary reversals"" in the hormonal regulation of growth across lizard species.  These species have been selected to span repeated evolutionary shifts between those in which males are larger and those in which females are larger. By simultaneously characterizing the effects of testosterone on the expression of thousands of genes, this project will also determine how such ""evolutionary reversals"" in the hormonal regulation of growth are accomplished at the genetic level. The results of this collaborative study will broaden understanding of the endocrine system.  It may also challenge generalizations derived from traditional animal models by investigating how closely related species evolve different responses to the same hormone. The project will also contribute to filling national teaching needs and will involve high school teachers in research experiences in an intensive summer program. Research training opportunities are being provided for a post-doctoral fellow, a PhD and an MS graduate student, and two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This Collaborative project addresses an issue of current debate in comparative endocrinology: whether the highly conserved vertebrate endocrine system tends to constrain adaptation, or whether key evolutionary changes in the coupling of hormones to gene networks instead facilitate rapid evolution. This project will combine hormone manipulations and high-throughput RNA sequencing aimed at (1) characterizing how the expression of growth-regulatory gene networks differs with respect to age, tissue, and hormone treatment using detailed experiments on three focal lizard species, (2) testing for evolutionary reversals in the hormonal regulation of growth and gene expression by extending these methods to a broader, phylogenetically informed sampling of related lizard species with variable patterns of sexual dimorphism in body size (male-larger or female-larger), and (3) characterizing rates of sequence evolution for thousands of expressed genes to test whether the specificity of expression that is achieved by hormonal regulation also frees coding sequences themselves to evolve more quickly. This research will support development of the recently sequenced genome of the Eastern Fence Lizard as an emerging resource for the fields of comparative endocrinology and evolutionary genetics.

Young individuals may be particularly vulnerable to thermal stress, but there is a gap in knowledge about how effects of thermal stress experienced early in life impact later life stages, and how such developmental constraints affect thermal adaptation. This project will uncover the genes and cellular processes that have evolved to enable natural populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to survive and thrive across a wide range of thermal environments across the globe. This research is important because it will characterize how organisms respond to environmental change during their lifetimes and how populations respond to environmental selection over longer evolutionary time scales. The results from this project will  advance the fields of ecological and evolutionary physiology. This project will have broad societal impacts through the training of the next generation of scientists from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and through dissemination of science to the public by producing an educational video about physiological change in relation to environmental change. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to reveal evolved mechanisms of thermal tolerance across life stages among natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. In oviparous animals with external embryonic development, embryos are vulnerable to changes in temperature because they are directly exposed to the external environment, have low thermal tolerance, and cannot behaviorally avoid extreme conditions. Thus, thermal selection is likely to target the embryonic life stage. Accordingly, embryos of tropical populations of D. melanogaster are more heat tolerant than embryos of temperate populations, whereas adult heat tolerance is the same across populations around the globe. Yet, it is not known how tropical embryos physiologically cope with extreme heat. To fill this gap in knowledge, the project will integrate genomic mapping, transcriptomics, protein biochemistry, and confocal fluorescence microscopy to identify the genetic and physiological bases of divergence in embryonic thermal tolerance among temperate and tropical populations.

This has resulted in significant milkweed replanting efforts by national initiatives and local enthusiasts. While meritorious in its conception, these replanting efforts tend to use a variety of milkweed species that can vary dramatically in their level of toxicity to Monarch larvae. Moreover, it is unknown how exposure to such varying levels of toxicity as larvae may affect the ability of surviving adult Monarch butterflies to establish viable populations and migrate to Mexican overwintering sites. Using NSF funding and leveraging a large-scale collaborative network of Monarch scientists, the researchers will quantify such effects by examining milkweed-Monarch interactions throughout their life history, under both controlled laboratory- and natural settings. In addition to Monarchs, this project will generally inform habitat restoration efforts aimed at offsetting population declines in other beneficial insects, as consequences of larval dietary history for adult traits important to population health are poorly understood in most insects.<br/><br/>Chemical ecology research on plant-insect herbivore interactions has abundantly focused on the proximate effects of plant defenses and toxicity on insect larval stages. Since insect larvae tend to cause most damage to plants, this focus makes sense, but as a result only limited information is available on indirect, i.e., beyond the larval stages, effects of host plant toxicity on adult insect traits important for population growth and dispersal. The proposed work will address this gap in knowledge by linking variation in plant defense biochemistry experienced by larvae to adult insect fitness outcomes. Using the iconic Monarch butterfly as a focal species, the PIs aim to quantify how variation in toxic traits among ten milkweed species (i.e., Monarch host plants) affect larval growth, adult fecundity and migratory ability, in laboratory and natural contexts. To achieve this aim, they will use an integrative approach that combines state-of-the-art methods in chemical ecology, organismal energetics, biomechanics, and leverage a citizen science driven collaboration with several laboratories located along the annual Monarch's migration routes. This work is pertinent to the focal species as replanting efforts aimed at restoring suitable habitat to combat Monarch population declines use multiple milkweed species without consideration for how larval exposure to varying milkweed defensive chemistry affects Monarch population dynamics and migration. In parallel, this project will generally inform science and habitat restoration efforts aimed at offsetting population declines in other beneficial insects, as consequences of larval dietary history for adult traits are poorly understood in most insects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strigolactones comprise a family of plant hormones that regulate shoot branching, root architecture, and cambial growth. Strigolactones also trigger germination of the highly destructive parasitic weeds, broomrape and witchweed, and promote symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which karrikins and strigolactones control plant growth may enable a new wave of innovation in crop development and weed control.<br/><br/>Plants recognize both karrikins and strigolactones through a genetic pathway that requires the F-box protein MAX2. F-box proteins have central roles in several plant hormone signaling systems, and act by targeting specific protein substrates for degradation. The targets of MAX2 have long remained elusive and as such represent a critical roadblock to understanding the mechanism of karrikin and strigolactone signaling. A genetic screen has now led to the identification of a candidate target, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), which regulates seed germination and seedling growth. SMAX1 is a member of an uncharacterized family of eight genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this project genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to determine 1) how other genes in the SMAX1 family contribute to plant development; 2) the molecular function and regulation of SMAX1 protein; and 3) the protein interacting partners of SMAX1 and MAX2. These experiments will reveal how the SMAX1 family acts in karrikin and strigolactone signaling and whether SMAX1 is a target of MAX2. <br/><br/>A postdoctoral researcher,graduate student, and several undergraduates will be trained for careers in science-related fields.

During courtship, the unusually colorful male Habronattus jumping spiders engage in elaborate dances that showcase movements, colors, and patterns to prospective mates. Although females react to these displays by changing where they face, we know almost nothing about where females look during courtship, or how male displays function to manipulate female gaze. To understand how these displays have evolved to capture and retain female visual attention, this research program will use newly available eye tracking technology and digital tools to examine interactions between male displays and female gaze in the Fiery Haired Jumping Spider, Habronattus pyrrithrix. The research team will then expand their work to 20 additional Habronattus species to understand broader patterns of display evolution. This research program will allow us to better understand how animals communicate through complex visual displays and how evolution shapes complex signals. In addition, the scientific team will use insights from their research to enrich educational collaborations with community partners. These partnerships include the development and implementation of curricula for regional public schools, as well as biomimicry-themed ""superhero summer camps"" and afterschool programming in collaboration with Assemble, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit organization which focuses on teaching inner-city youth about science by integrating art into science education.<br/><br/>One widespread feature of visual systems is distinct regionalization of visual competency across the visual field, including regions of heightened motion sensitivity, spatial acuity and/or color vision. Animals compensate for this regionalization with movements of the head or eyes that aim specialized retinal regions at areas of interest within the visual scene. These gaze movements determine what animals see when they interact with visual stimuli. However, despite the fundamental importance of gaze to animal vision, we know almost nothing about how animals use their gaze to evaluate communicatory displays. We know even less about how visual displays have evolved to effectively capture, retain or manipulate the gaze of signal receivers. This research will build upon current understandings of the coevolution of visual signals and visual systems by evaluating the evolutionary relevance of gaze-display dynamics for diversification of male courtship displays in Habronattus spiders. The research will employ gaze-tracking, video playbacks, and digital and physical manipulations of male displays to reveal basic properties of gaze-display interactions in the species Habronattus pyrrithrix. Leveraging insights derived from these in-depth studies, the research will use comparative approaches to test broader hypotheses regarding the evolution of gaze-display interactions across the genus Habronattus."

Defining these cellular processes will provide insights into the organization and operation of all neural circuits, and will speak to how nervous systems can produce reliable behaviors while constantly adjusting in response to unique sets of ever-changing perturbations. This research is important because it will advance the quest to understand how the nervous system copes with variability arising from individual differences in genetic, developmental and life histories so that each individual nervous system can produce similar behaviors and respond to perturbations in a like manner. Equally important, this project is designed to train the next generation of scientists, instill a deeper appreciation of science in the public, promote minorities in science and provide a valuable scientific community resource. <br/><br/>This project addresses how low-level modulatory tone stabilizes circuit output over the long-term using a simple model, the crustacean pyloric network. This 14-neuron circuit comprises identifiable neurons with specific activity features. A given attribute is defined by an explicit balance of conductances and is maintained by preserving its underlying conductance correlations. Low levels of monoamines can enable feedback loops that preserve conductance correlations and their corresponding activity features, even when one of the balanced conductances is persistently altered through experimental manipulation. The goal of the research is to elucidate the molecular processes involved in monoamine-enabled maintenance of conductance correlations. Recent studies show that monoamines act through microRNA to persistently influence a conductance correlation and stabilize its corresponding activity feature. A combination of molecular and electrophysiological techniques will be used to identify microRNAs that are regulated by monoaminergic tone and that maintain a specific conductance correlation.  The expression of these microRNAs will then be altered to determine the effects on neuronal and circuit output. An annotated microRNA database will also be developed, hosted on a local server and made freely available."

As a parasite it lives in association with at least one other plant, from which it derives all its water and nutritional needs, while providing nothing to its host in return. Cuscuta obtains its food from other plants, so it has no need for roots, leaves or photosynthesis, and appears as a network of yellow vining stems that wind around host plants. Cuscuta provides a fresh perspective for understanding plant science because its evolution to parasitism has resulted in exaggerated features that push the boundaries of plants capabilities. For example, Cuscuta seedlings can identify host locations and grow toward them, demonstrating an ability to detect and respond to other plants in their environment. Also, the ability of Cuscuta to feed off other plants creates a system in which to explore plant interactions at the cell level and to shape concepts of plant disease. Finally, the Cuscuta habit of exchanging RNA and proteins with hosts challenges our understanding of genetic regulation of individual organisms. This EDGE project aims to expand the use of Cuscuta as a research model system through development of plant transformation methods to genetically test gene function, and to provide techniques and tips on growing Cuscuta to other scientists. Growing the Cuscuta research community will promote progress in basic plant science with potential impacts in disease resistance, agricultural ecology and weed control.<br/><br/>The major barrier preventing the use of Cuscuta as a model plant system is the lack of a protocol for transformation and regeneration of the plant that would enable studies of gene function. The primary objective of this project is to develop transgenic Cuscuta. A few previous studies have established conditions for either Cuscuta callus transformation or regeneration from callus, but never both with the same tissue. This project focuses on systematically optimizing Cuscuta culture conditions, transformation, and regeneration to produce stably transformed parasitic plants. This will include evaluation of several Cuscuta species for amenability to transformation, along with testing Agrobacterium strains for efficiency of Cuscuta transformation. Additional approaches that aim for rapid transformation of Cuscuta without a tissue culture step (i.e., floral dip) will be tested as well. All protocols and resources will be made accessible to the broader plant community through a project website and through publications.

Photoprotective mechanisms used by cyanobacteria have only recently begun to be characterized. A key factor involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection is the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) that works together with the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) to convert excess light energy to heat to protect the photosynthetic reaction centers from photodamage, thereby maintaining photosynthetic efficiency and productivity.

In addition to training students and postdoctoral scientists in diverse methods, broader impacts of the research include understanding the mechanisms used by cyanobacteria to protect themselves from excess light absorption and associated light-induced damage. Such knowledge will enhance efforts to increase the efficiency of light capture and reduce photodamage in bioenergy or production strains of cyanobacteria. The project also includes structured mentoring in hands-on research for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in the sciences and participation in an annual Microbiology Day at a local science museum targeting primary and middle school students. <br/><br/>In contrast to those of plants, the photoprotective mechanisms of cyanobacteria have only recently begun to be characterized. One of the most prevalent, the OCP/FRP (Orange Carotenoid Protein/Fluorescence Recovery Protein) system responds to high light by dissipating excess energy captured by the light harvesting antenna (phycobilisome or PBS).  The OCP is a soluble, 35 kDa protein that binds a single carotenoid molecule.   It is the only known photoactive protein that uses a carotenoid as its sole chromophore. The absorption of blue-green light causes the OCP to convert from a dark stable orange form, OCPO, to a light-activated red form, OCPR.  OCPR directly participates in photoprotection by binding to the PBS.  Recovery from the energy-dissipative state is catalyzed by the FRP.  Structurally, the OCP consists of two domains, one serving as a sensor/regulatory domain whereas the other functions directly in energy dissipation.  We have identified a family of paralogous genes encoding the separate domains in Fremyella diplosiphon and hypothesize that they reflect the evolution of the OCP and that they provide flexibility in tuning photoprotection in Fremyella under dynamic environmental conditions.  A combination of in vivo approaches in Fremyella and in vitro analysis of the isolated proteins will be used in conjunction with bioinformatics to test these hypotheses.   In addition to training students and postdoctoral scientists in diverse methods, broader impacts of the research include an in-depth understanding of the flexibility of photoprotective mechanisms that may be useful in bioengineering of cyanobacteria."

This research focuses on understanding how cells adopt a specific cell fate as they traverse through the embryo. The cells within the early embryo turn on specific genes, in part, in response to chemical cues they receive from their neighboring cells. This project will discover how genes are controlled by a group of regulatory RNAs. These regulatory RNAs control the level of gene expressions of many genes in several cell types to ensure proper development. Thus, this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of animal development. The project includes education activities that are synergistic to the proposed research project. The first educational activity involves an outreach program at the Delaware Children's Museum where the PI and her students develop a mobile microscope for young children to conduct hands-on, exploratory activities. The second educational activity is to enhance the knowledge base of future early childhood teachers by instilling confidence in science teaching, and by supporting science curriculum development. Inexpensive smartphone microscope platforms are placed in the hands of student teachers to foster future use in their own classrooms. This project is integrated into research training of undergraduate and graduate students and courses taught at the University of Delaware. The proposed educational activities incorporate the PI's expertise in development biology, microscopy, and ongoing research collaborations.<br/>  <br/>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved regulatory RNA molecules that control a myriad of biological processes, including development. In early development, cell specification and pattern formation are controlled by cross-regulation of gene regulatory networks (GRN) and signaling pathways. Signaling morphogen gradients are critical regulators that need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that the precise organization of the embryo is achieved. This project addresses the overarching hypothesis that miRNAs perform this critical regulatory function. Its goal is to understand how miRNAs integrate GRNs and signaling pathways to drive development. To accomplish this goal, this study uses the sea urchin to study complex developmental processes that are shared by a wide range of organisms. The sea urchin has an exceptionally well-studied GRN and most of its miRNA families consist of a single species, which makes it amenable to unique, powerful functional analysis. To determine the mechanisms by which miRNAs control cell fate specification and directed cell movement during early embryogenesis, the PI will determine regulatory mechanisms of a highly conserved microRNA, miR-31, in the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) lineage. This project examines how miR-31 coordinately suppresses PMC GRN components and cross-regulates signaling pathways to drive PMC development, using proteomic, transcriptomic, imaging, embryo transplantation, and molecular approaches. Overall, this study will advance the field of miRNA research and contribute to the fundamental understanding of early developmental processes."

Crop yields are particularly vulnerable to a changing climate, as flowering time is strongly regulated by external temperature as well as the light environment. It is of great interest to understand the mechanisms governing flowering time in natural conditions to improve the performance of crops. Many plants, including major crops, utilize changes in day length to adjust the timing of flowering over the seasons, as these changes occur in a more predictable manner than other environmental changes. The mechanisms of day length-controlled flowering have been most characterized in Arabidopsis, the genetic model plant. Because flowering time is controlled in many plants by common mechanisms, the knowledge obtained from Arabidopsis has accelerated the research on flowering time being carried out on all major crops, as well as the research on plants commercially important for agriculture, horticulture and forestry. In the lab, simplified research conditions with few variables make it easier to more accurately analyze results, but these conditions may not precisely reflect what happens in nature. By adjusting several critical environmental parameters (such as light and temperature) of the current standard lab conditions to more closely reflect natural settings, this project will provide a more accurate understanding of the mechanisms of seasonal flowering. This project will also nurture interdisciplinary training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and undergraduate students, and support the involvement of ethnic minorities and women in science.<br/><br/>Flowering is induced by largely conserved mechanisms in angiosperms. In Arabidopsis, the key mechanism is the way in which light and the circadian clock regulate the expression of the master flowering gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Preliminary results indicate that our current understanding of day length-dependent flowering regulation is not sufficient to explain the regulatory mechanism of plants grown under natural long-day conditions. In plants grown outside near the time of the summer solstice, FT expression patterns differed from those in plants grown in long-day conditions in the lab. This is likely caused by the differences in light quality and temperature between those conditions. This project aims to more precisely examine the combinatorial effects of daily light and temperature changes on flowering time at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. The knowledge obtained will provide a mechanistic insight into seasonal flowering events happening at present in nature and provide clues that will help us predict flowering phenology in rapidly changing climates. The information regarding improved lab growth conditions that more closely reflect natural conditions will be disseminated to members of the research community to help improve their research. In addition, the related video outreach activity will generate teaching tools for high school science classes, and also provide videos that depict dynamic developmental changes in plants for the general public."

The sense of smell is essential for maintaining quality of life in humans, and its decline can be an important harbinger of neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, since nearly all animals aside from primates rely on olfaction for most survival functions, understanding chemical sensing has immense practical value, for example, in the control of agricultural pests or in training animals to detect odors relevant for bomb, drug and cancer detection. In spite of its importance, the understanding of olfaction lags far behind the other senses, which is in part due to the lack of understanding of the physical space of odors. The understanding of the neural bases of vision and audition were greatly advanced by investigations of the physical dimensions of visual and auditory stimuli. It is therefore likely that a similar in-depth investigation of odor space - how natural odors occur and the backgrounds against which they must be detected - will reveal a new depth of richness of neural representations of odors in the brain. Insects such as the fruit fly and honey bee are excellent models for this research because of the accessibility of their central nervous systems, because of their ease of use under controlled laboratory conditions, and because of the functional similarity of how odors are processed in insect and mammalian brains. This research will characterize how odor flowers and fruits with respect to behavioral value for honey bees (food) and fruit flies (food and egg laying sites). Further monitoring of neural activity in early and later stage processing in the brain, when combined with computational modeling, will reveal significantly richer neural representations than have heretofore been described. This new understanding stands to have an impact on understanding how healthy brains encode sensations and memories of odors and how brains fail under disease conditions. It will also have an impact on understanding how the sense of smell may be built into engineered devices. Finally, both insects are also of economic importance to agriculture for crop pollination (honey bees) and damage to fruit (fruit flies). The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>This research will quantitatively characterize the real-world statistics of multi-component natural odor scenes and investigate how they drive behavior and processing in several brain regions. The focus will be on honey bee as well as fruit fly adults and larva as models, where it will be possible to characterize a library of ethologically relevant natural odors associated with a diversity of behavioral outputs. The work will begin by quantitatively characterizing the detailed statistical properties of natural odor scenes in defined ethological contexts. This will build on the rich literature on identified natural odors in insects and mammals. Naturally occurring plant and fruit odor samples from the natural environments of each insect will be collected and chemically analyzed. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques and approaches based on sparse coding will determine the dimensions of odor space that are most salient for behavioral decisions. Such a quantitative deconstruction of the sensory input would be unprecedented in olfactory neuroscience, and should allow the PIs to effectively and comprehensively drive olfactory circuits for the first time. The hypothesis is that the stimulus dimensions that are most behaviorally relevant to the animal will be most efficiently extracted by the olfactory system. Synthetic odor blends will be specially constructed to vary along relevant sensory dimensions, to probe neural codes and adaptive behaviors in the olfactory system. As in research on the visual system, analysis of such evoked neural responses using statistical methods that take into account natural odor statistics will reveal novel olfactory computations and behaviors that have been previously inaccessible. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering and biology."

Sterols are lipid (fat) molecules that have multiple biological roles in eukaryotic (human, animal, and plant) cells. These roles include maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes. The best-known sterol is probably cholesterol. Sterols are also produced by some bacteria, but their purpose is unknown because bacterial cell membranes are not reported to need sterols. Discovering the purpose of bacterial sterols will make a significant contribution because knowledge of sterol function, in general, will be expanded. This is of broader relevance to society because of the fundamental importance of sterols as cellular building blocks, but also in more practical terms. For example, sterols such as cholesterol are essential in human physiology, and fungal sterol synthesis can be targeted by specific drugs to treat fungal infections. The project will also enhance the country's scientific workforce by providing cutting edge training in modern biological and analytical chemistry technologies. <br/><br/>Part II Technical:  <br/>The project goal is to determine the role of sterols in Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first bacterium in which sterols have been shown to be essential. G. obscuriglobus possesses a unique constellation of eukaryote-like, sterol-associated, cellular features, including budding replication, complex intracellular membranes, and endocytosis-like behavior. The central hypothesis is that that Gemmata sterols have an expanded functional repertoire relative to eukaryotic sterols, including known functions of sterols in eukaryotes, as well as novel functions specific to a bacterial cellular context. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will expand our functional and evolutionary understanding of sterols, and uncover overlaps in the roles of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sterols. The project objective will be achieved by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine how G. obscuriglobus sterols support budding replication; (2) Identify the contribution of G. obscuriglobus sterols to endocytosis-like activity; (3) Establish the effect of sterols on phospholipid metabolism in G. obscuriglobus. Research methods include microscopy, proteomics, and lipidomics. The expected outcome of the project is an improved understanding of sterol function, and the potential contribution of sterols to bacterial membrane-mediated processes characteristic of eukaryotes, as well as novel functions specific to bacteria. This will have important positive impact because it will potentially reveal previously undetected similarities and differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and functions. Broader Impacts include the Microbestiary, a unique science-art education and outreach project, where microbes and their cell structures serve as the subject matter. Multiple education and outreach products, including K-12 participation, will be generated, and the Microbestiary will be incorporated into undergraduate teaching in the humanities and sciences. Participation in this project will provide interdisciplinary training in cell biology and analytical chemistry for graduate and undergraduate students, who will also be key personnel for creating and disseminating the Microbestiary."

However, discoveries in molecular genetics are revealing a more complex reality in which an array of heritable chemical signals determine when, where and in what environmental contexts genes are turned on or turned off.  Such control of gene expression is much more sensitive to environmental influences than DNA sequence, and environmentally-induced changes can be transmitted across generations to effect changes in offspring growth, metabolism, neurological development and fertility. A major unresolved question is whether transmission of acquired information across generations enables organisms to respond to environmental challenges or not. This project exploits the unique reproductive characteristics of a model arthropod species, in which embryos develop in an external, transparent brood sac and can be monitored and manipulated, to determine whether environmentally-induced epigenetic effects play a causal role in the transmission of altered gene expression patterns from parents to offspring. The project will provide training for K-12 instructors, high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar and will include high school outreach in the form of museum exhibits, internships, presentations, training in molecular techniques, advising in science project competitions and assistance with curriculum development. <br/><br/>The impact of naturally occurring mitochondrial variation on the epigenetic regulation of nuclear gene expression by small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) and its effects on evolutionary responses to environmental challenges are poorly understood. This project will exploit two highly divergent mitochondrial haplogroups (A, B2) that co-occur in populations of the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, to determine whether selection acting on this pool of genetic diversity can enable this tropical arthropod to respond to temperature-induced physiological stress through adaptation and/or environmentally-induced epigenetic changes. The project will include: (1) a multi-generation experiment to examine the response of A and B2 haplogroups to incrementally increasing temperatures; (2) an epigenetic response experiment in which replicates of the haplogroups will be reared as split broods at control and elevated temperatures, and offspring assayed from the control and elevated temperature treatment crosses, and (3) a study in which differentially-expressed sncRNAs will be microinjected into early-stage embryos to assess possible causal epigenetic effects on elevated temperature response. Taken together, these experiments will address the potential for an adaptive evolutionary response to environmental challenges, and will determine whether: (1) divergent mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their responses; (2) epigenetic effects are adaptive or pathological; (3) epigenetic effects are transmitted paternally or maternally, and (4) differentially expressed sncRNAs play a causal role in the transmission of environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications."

The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between bacteria called rhizobia and legume plants benefits both partners. For the legume, the symbiosis gives them access to biologically active nitrogen, an essential nutrient that the rhizobia can ""fix"" using inert nitrogen gas. The bacteria get a place to live in root nodules, organs formed on the legume after bacterial infection. Nodule formation requires the rhizobia to communicate with the host plant.  The plant wants successful infection by bacteria that can fix nitrogen but must still defend itself against pathogens. Because rhizobia want to infect where they can, legumes also limit nodule formation using selectively applied defenses. One plant defense, called autoregulation of nodulation (AON), blocks the formation of too many nodules. A newly identified rhizobial gene, glx, increases nodulation in pea and in alfalfa, possibly by interfering with AON. This project investigates the physiological and biochemical mechanisms by which glx stimulates nodulation. The research will contribute a better understanding of one of the most accessible stories about a mutualistic symbiosis, a highly beneficial relationship between humble, non-pathogenic rhizobia and their green and often delicious legume hosts. Since poor nodulation can limit nitrogen fixation and plant growth, being able to increase nodulation could be helpful in agriculture, where it might reduce the need to apply ammonia fertilizer and would decrease the associated environmental problems. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and working with undergraduate and high school students to develop their understanding of hands-on science. In addition, outreach to grower communities in the region, especially with regard to the major pulse and forage legumes produced in the state of Washington, will focus on how new scientific developments might influence agriculture.<br/><br/>Control of nodulation by legumes is not understood very well. In order to establish a symbiotic interaction, signaling and signal transduction are crucial. The glx gene, which significantly increases nodulation when introduced into rhizobia that nodulate pea and barrel medic, shows that glx can alter development in two different symbioses and hints that it may act by affecting fundamental circuitry. In a pathogenic context, glx would be called a virulence determinant because it stimulates infection. The systemic plant defense called autoregulation of nodulation (AON) limits the formation of too many nodules after an initial infection. glx appears to be able to bypass or overcome AON. AON is mediated by peptide signals that are generated in a newly infected root then transferred to the shoot, where a receptor then generates a factor, called the shoot-derived inhibitor, that is transported to the roots and inhibits further nodulation. The glx gene is annotated as a glyoxalase/dioxygenase, suggesting it is involved in oxidation of small molecules. The putative small molecules may interact with the AON signal transduction pathway or with similar circuits the legume uses to limit nodulation in response to abundant nitrogen or low pH.  Determining how the glx gene acts to increase nodulation through its activity or metabolites that it generates will provide a bacterial probe into the controlled response that the plant uses to optimize its interaction with rhizobia. The knowledge gained will increase fundamental understanding of plant-microbe communications and may have practical consequences in agriculture."

It has since been shown that temperature determines gender in some fish and amphibians, many lizards, numerous turtles, and all crocodilians. Yet, the mechanism that converts temperature into a biological signal for male versus female development is not known. The Rhen lab has identified novel temperature sensitive genes that respond quickly to temperature change in snapping turtle embryos. These particular genes are known to turn on or turn off gene expression during embryonic development in other species by modifying chromosomal structure. Such factors are also known as epigenetic regulators and may play a role in gender determination. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms regulate expression of genes required for testis or ovary development. Ultimately, this research will advance our understanding of temperature-dependent gender determination and provide insight into the role epigenetic mechanisms play in testis and ovary development in all vertebrates. Educational activities will enhance learning through semester long projects in the classroom, improve undergraduate research experiences through extended internships of 2-3 years, and increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in biology. Outreach activities will train Rhen lab members to communicate science more effectively to the public, disseminate findings to a wider audience through production of a mini-documentary about temperature-dependent gender determination, and target a demographic that is neglected in STEM outreach through an informal class for older Americans.<br/><br/>The Rhen lab has developed the common snapping turtle as a model to study unique and conserved mechanisms of gender determination in vertebrates. The overarching hypothesis is that temperature-dependent changes in histone methylation play a key role in regulating transcriptional programs for testis versus ovary development. Experiments test the specific hypothesis that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and lysine-specific demethylase 6B regulate methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) in gonads from embryos incubated under male and female thermal regimes. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 methylates histone H3 at lysine 27. Trimethylated histone H3 (H3K27me3) is a stable epigenetic mark that represses transcription. Conversely, lysine-specific demethylase 6B allows gene expression by demethylating H3K27me3 to H3K27me2 and H3K27me1. In Aim 1, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR will be used to analyze temperature effects on H3K27 methylation at conserved gender-determining loci. In Aim 2, ChIP-Sequencing will be used to analyze temperature effects on genome-wide patterns of H3K27 methylation in embryonic gonads. In Aim 3, experiments will test whether Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and lysine-specific demethylase 6B are causally involved in gender determination by perturbing gene expression and/or using pharmacological inhibitors of these proteins. This research will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature-dependent expression of gender-determining genes.

This research project will determine how EAAT3 controls glutamatergic signaling and synaptic integration onto two distinct types of striatal neurons. To accomplish this goal, the investigators use a comprehensive and multidisciplinary toolbox that includes electrophysiological, optical imaging, and computer modeling approaches, as well as mice genetically-engineered that express either D1- or D2-type dopamine neurons.. The project includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines while advancing and transforming our knowledge of striatal circuits. Inclusion of underrepresented minorities and public engagement activities are an integral part of the project, to broaden its impact with the general public.<br/><br/>Our ability to perform movements relies on the activity of a neuronal circuit known as the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway. Relay of information in the CSTC pathway relies on the coordinated activation of neurons in the striatum, a major node of the CSTC pathway. The striatum is largely composed of two types of long-projection neurons that express either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in the striatum but their role in controlling the coordinated activity of striatal neurons remains enigmatic. The first goal of this project is to determine how neuronal glutamate transporters regulate excitatory transmission in D1- and D2-expressing neurons. The second goal is to determine how these transporters shape the temporal accuracy with which these cells relay information from incoming excitatory inputs. The experimental strategies entail innovative multi-disciplinary approaches based on electrophysiology, optogenetics, imaging and computer modeling. The proposed research will generate new knowledge on the functional role of glutamate transporters in the activity patterns and dynamics of circuits implicated in habitual movement execution."

This arrangement would allow the pollen produced by the anther to land on the top of the pistil to result in self-pollination and consequent inbreeding.  Inbreeding is deleterious to any organism, as it causes reduced fitness in progeny.  Flowering plants have adopted self-incompatibility (SI), which allows the pistil to reject self-pollen to prevent inbreeding, but accept non-self pollen to promote outcrossing.  Since Charles Darwin first documented this phenomenon in a monograph published in 1876, SI has attracted the interest of a wide spectrum of biologists.  The PI has identified a pistil protein and 17 pollen proteins that are key players in mediating SI in Petunia inflata, a wild relative of garden petunia.  In this project, the PI and his collaborator will use a combination of molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, and structural approaches to determine how the 17 pollen proteins and a single pistil protein work together to allow the pistil to specifically reject self-pollen.  The results have wider implications for the study of many other biological systems employing self/non-self recognition.  The genes for these proteins could be used to facilitate hybrid-seed production, which, if accomplished, would provide tremendous agronomic benefits.  The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students in this project to prepare them for future research careers, and will offer summer research opportunity for high school students through Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science Program. <br/><br/>In S-RNase-based self-incompatibility in Petunia inflata, the polymorphic S-locus controls the outcome of pollination; matching of the pollen S-haplotype with either S-haplotype of the pistil results in growth inhibition of pollen tubes.  The PI has shown that the S-RNase gene controls pistil specificity and identified 17 S-locus F-box (SLF) genes in S2-haplotype that collectively control pollen specificity.  In this project, the PI will complete the determination of 187 interaction relationships between all 17 SLF proteins and 11 allelic variants of S-RNase.  These results will be used to study the biochemical basis of differential interactions between SLF proteins and S-RNases, and select SLF/S-RNase pairs for X-ray structural study of the interactions.  Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones collectively containing the S-RNase and 17 SLF genes have been isolated, sequenced, and assembled, totaling ~3.1 Mbp.  To fill gaps in the S-locus sequence, additional BAC clones will be isolated and sequenced.  The PI has shown that all 17 SLF proteins form similar SCF complexes, but the Cullin1 and Skp1 components (PiCUL1-P and PiSSK1) are pollen-specific.  The effect of knockout and suppressed expression of PiCUL1-P and PiSSK1 will be examined, and the X-ray structure of the SCFSLF complex will be determined.  The PI has found that SLF proteins themselves are subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the 26S proteasome, and identified proteins that may be involved in regulating the dynamics of the SCFSLF complex.  The role of these proteins will be examined.  All X-ray crystallization experiments will be performed in the lab of the collaborator."

Many pathogens deliver effector proteins into their hosts to promote virulence of the pathogen. Over evolutionary time, the plant can evolve to recognize specific effector proteins from the pathogen. The PI's research group has identified a plant protein (a ""decoy"") that acts as a ""mousetrap"" for a pathogen effector protein, and enables the plant to mount a strong immune response. This work will determine the genetic parameters necessary for pathogen recognition in the host, in order to help design better decoys and protect crops from infection. This project includes substantial outreach to a local two-year college that serves a diverse student body, including underrepresented groups (37% Hispanic, 24% African American, 19% Asian, 1% Hawaiian) and underprivileged students (68% receive financial aid), in order to expose students to cutting-edge research and broader educational opportunities. <br/><br/>Dissection of the molecular determinants underlying host immunity will provide a rigorous toolkit to combat the significant problem posed by plant pathogens. HopZ1a, a Pseudomonas syringae type III secreted effector protein, is recognized indirectly through ZAR1, a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat containing receptor protein, when HopZ1a acetylates the ZED1 pseudokinase. ZED1 appears to be a decoy that has evolved to trap the T3SE into recognition, as it is not a functional kinase and does not have a role in basal immunity. This work will examine ZAR1 and ZED1 natural and mutant diversity in order to develop constraints for rational design of a pathogen decoy. The PI will collaborate with a local two-year college that primarily serves underprivileged students and underrepresented groups, and will host several students each summer to learn new scientific techniques. The lab will design a module on plant immunity that will be taught in the college. This will provide teaching opportunities for students and post-docs, and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Together these efforts will encourage underrepresented students to pursue and excel at multi-disciplinary scientific research, provide outreach opportunities for graduate students and post-docs, and make progress on significant scientific and agricultural problems."

This research program aims to use the fin ray skeleton to reveal fundamental mechanisms that allow bones to establish, remember and re-create their shapes. Further, since the functional significance of fin structure is incompletely understood, this research is integrated with an undergraduate training program that will address outstanding questions about the diversity, performance and evolution of fin ray structures and branching patterns. This course will reciprocally inform and enrich the overall research effort, and will mentor students from diverse backgrounds in answering research questions of their own design.

By performing photosynthesis in the chloroplast, a specialized cell compartment, plants transform light into chemical energy and fix CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, they provide the air we breathe by releasing oxygen, and they represent the main part of our diet. As sessile life forms, plants have to cope with constantly changing, often times harsh, environments. As average temperatures rise, drought and interrelated soil salinity become increasingly problematic for plant performance and agricultural production in the US and globally. Salt stress affects photosynthesis by destroying the fine-tuned ion balance in the chloroplast. This process involves transporter proteins but most genes encoding chloroplast ion transporters are unknown. Dr. Kunz and his group investigate a new set of plant genes and mutants to determine their role in chloroplast ion transport. Moreover, his group is building a genetic tool that allows for testing the relevance of all chloroplast proteins and entire protein families in plant function and photosynthesis. The tool will be applied to precisely determine the genes crucial for plant performance under salt stress. This research will provide critical knowledge and new strategies to increase crop yields even under adverse climatic conditions. Dr. Kunz engages high school students in his research to raise awareness for plant research and its significance for a sustainable future and to excite the future generation of scientist for the world's most fundamental biochemical process, photosynthesis.<br/><br/>Plant photosynthesis is affected by soil salinity but little is known about the genes involved and their potential to improve plant resistance. Salt stress triggers changes in transcription of nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and the chloroplast proteome. Physiologically, salt stress leads to toxic Na+ accumulation in plastids and outcompeting of K+ which disturbs chloroplast ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, and eventually diminishes photosynthetic efficiency. Recently, the first plastid K+ efflux carriers were discovered. Corresponding loss-of-function mutant plants reveal poor photosynthesis under control conditions but, surprisingly, photosynthesis is rescued by salt stress. This emphasizes the potential of manipulating plastid ion flux to increase photosynthetic efficiency during salt stress. However, this approach is hindered by the limited number of characterized plastid ion transporters, most strikingly a chloroplast K+ importer. One hurdle is the high number of gene family members in chloroplasts which often results in functional redundancy and a lack of phenotypes. This project will: 1. Determine the role of plastid K+ channel homologs for K+ import, 2. Define the genes responsible for the unexpected salt stress rescue of plastid K+ efflux carrier mutants. 3. Build and apply a full-coverage artificial library tool to downregulate all nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and gene family transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana and determine the genes responsible for plastid Na+ influx and low photosynthesis during salt stress. 4.

This raises pressing concerns for biodiversity and aquaculture, and poses fundamental issues related to evolution of host/pathogen interactions. Indeed, the remarkable emerging features of ranavirus infections appear intimately linked to controlling immune responses in many host species, and growing evidence hints at macrophages as critical for their infection strategy.

Plants go through successive phases in their lifecycle. During vegetative development plants convert the energy from sunlight into resources. When plants switch to flowering, the accumulated resources are incorporated into the seeds. As a consequence, the timing of flowering impacts both plant biomass production (biofuel production) and the number of fruits and seeds produced (yield). Plants adjust the time to flower formation based on environmental cues, most importantly the season of the year and the temperature. When seasonal cues are optimal for flowering, plants produce a substance called  ""florigen"". Florigen moves throughout the plant and triggers production of flowers. A closely related substance named ""antiflorigen"" prevents flower formation in the absence of the seasonal cue. Despite its important function, it is not understood how antiflorigen prevents flowering, nor how antiflorigen activity is overcome to allow flower formation. The proposed activities will address these deficiencies. Insight gained can be used to enhance desirable traits in crop species. The research will be discussed with the general public in conjunction the national citizen science ""Project Bud Burst"" at the Morris Arboretum. Contributions to enhancing high school education will be made through lectures and workshops during the yearly high school summer research academy and hands on teacher professional development. Finally, undergraduates will be engaged in research related to the role and regulation of antiflorigen in laboratory classes and in the research lab.<br/><br/>This proposal will address two general questions. The first is how TFL1 represses onset of flower formation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analysis of gene expression, the proposal will identify the genes directly repressed by the antiflorigen TFL1 prior to the onset of flower formation. Both candidate gene and unbiased genomic approaches will be employed. Follow-up molecular and genetic studies will assess the biological contribution of the TFL1 target genes to TFL1 function. Finally, the proposed activities will elucidate how TFL1 is recruited to its target loci. The second question to be addressed is how TFL1-mediated repression is overcome to allow formation of the first flower upon perception of inductive cues. Using biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches, the proposed activities will test the hypothesis that competition by the FT florigen for access to shared target loci and subsequent negative feedback by LFY and AP1 on TFL1 expression play critical roles in this process. Mathematical modeling will be used to determine whether the uncovered interactions explain the behavior of the system."

The leaf blade is a highly organized structure with cells in the upper and lower surfaces specialized for solar energy capture and gaseous exchange, respectively. The mechanism by which this highly organized blade development regulated is a longstanding question in plant developmental biology. The M. truncatula regulatory gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), critically regulates blade outgrowth in the middle region between the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The mechanism of STF function is unknown, which creates a major gap in understanding of the mechanism that governs leaf blade development. The overarching objective of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism of leaf blade development by analyzing the function of STF. This objective will be achieved using a combination of molecular and genomics approaches. The project will integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines including biochemistry, evolutionary biology, and developmental biology and will transform the mechanistic understanding of growth in plant lateral organs by providing the molecular basis for cell proliferation and expansion in the leaf tissue. This is very exciting because it will uncover the fundamental basis of plant form and function. The knowledge gained from this project will enable manipulating plant size and architecture to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and environmental adaptation to improve biomass and crop yield for food, feed, fuel, and fiber for the benefit of society.

How microglia can sense the activity of neurons is currently unknown, but understanding such a mechanism is critical to unraveling how microglia perform their physiological functions. The experiments proposed determine how neuronal activity affects microglial signaling and physical contacts with neurons by monitoring both neurons and microglia in the living mouse brain. The results will give a wealth of knowledge about how microglia behave in the physiological brain and also give insights into how their functions could impact neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. In the process of doing the experiments, young scientists are trained for a future in academic and non-academic science, and participate in outreach activities that teach K-5 children about the brain. Additionally, scientists from upstate New York with research programs that focus on glial biology come together to share their new results to build a new vision of how these cells act together with neurons to perform computations.<br/><br/>To understand physiological microglial function, it is necessary to study these cells with minimal perturbation in the living brain. Two-photon microscopy allows the monitoring of signaling within cells in the intact brain, and in this project the investigator images calcium signals in neurons and microglia of anesthetized and of awake mice. Neuronal calcium signaling indicates levels of neuronal activity in a dendrite-specific manner, and the behavior of microglia with respect to more and less active dendrites can be tracked. However, little is known about the function of calcium signaling in microglia. The imaging experiments provide information on whether intracellular calcium is responsible for directed movements of microglial processes and interactions with neurons in vivo. The experiments address how such activity influences microglial contacts with synapses, synapse elimination, and microglial signaling. Taken together, the studies allow for deeper understanding of how microglia and neurons interact in physiological conditions."

The team will also integrate these modeling approaches in fresh ways to generate novel insights for both basic behavioral ecology and for understanding responses to environmental change. Finally, the modelers will collaborate with empiricists to review relevant empirical literature and to write conceptual overview papers on behavioral responses to environmental change.  The project offers abundant opportunities for training a new generation of young scientists on the interface between math and biology.  The project will also include workshops that will involve not just the team and mentees, but also dozens of other empiricists and applied scientists.  The project will create a new website that will feature: 1) summaries of the models, predictions, and implications, with 2) advice to empiricists on which models to apply to specific scenarios, and 3) computer code including user-friendly models suitable for use in undergraduate courses. Finally, the project will seek to collaboratively develop classroom modules for potential implementation as part of Next Generation Science Standards that have been adopted in much of the United States."

A defining characteristic enabling this interaction is that the fish can swim unharmed among the stinging tentacles of the sea anemone. Despite over 50 years of research, the physiological adaptations enabling this interaction remain a mystery. What is known is that the protection involves the mucous coat of the fish and that sea anemones detect prey by sensing sugar chains that are attached to proteins through a process called glycosylation. The current study will investigate this question from two angles. First, to identify potential physiological mechanisms protecting the fish, mucous glycosylation patterns will be compared between non-symbiotic fish species and several species that have independently evolved interactions with sea anemones. The researchers will then test the effects of these glycosylation patterns on stinging responses of sea anemones. Second, the researchers will investigate the ability of anemonefish to gain protection from sea anemones that are initially hostile. High-throughput methods will compare naive and associating anemonefish to determine if they regulate gene expression, protein expression, or mucous glycosylation during acclimation to a sea anemone. This project also integrates the above research goals with education and outreach approaches tailored to UMass Dartmouth and the surrounding community. UMass Dartmouth is a predominantly undergraduate-serving institution, and over 50% of its undergraduates are first generation college students. An open-ended classroom research experience is being developed to reinforce genetics concepts taught in lecture through molecular laboratory investigations of genes related to the anemonefish-sea anemone symbiosis. In addition, three graduate students and ten undergraduate researchers will be trained on the project. Finally, the researchers are partnering with the New Bedford Ocean Explorium to develop education opportunities and teacher training workshops to enhance regional K-12 science education."

Temperature greatly influences various developmental programs of plants. Although plant responses to stressful temperature changes have been thoroughly studied, the effect of mild alterations in temperature on plant development is less understood. In particular, changing temperatures lead to changes in gene expression that can regulate the onset of reproductive development (flowering), however the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. This project seeks to understand how plants cope with changes in temperature for their developmental reprogramming. Fluctuations in temperature impact both vegetative growth (plant biomass accumulation) and reproductive transition (the production of flowers, fruits and seeds) of plants. Therefore, knowledge of the mechanisms by which plants respond to changing temperatures will guide improvement of crop plants that can cope with changing temperatures. This project will further our understanding of the genetic mechanisms that govern temperature-triggered developmental reprogramming in plants. Genetic, biochemical and genomics approaches will be used to dissect the regulatory networks that translate temperature changes into developmental changes. Further, this proposed research will provide critical training for the next generation of scientists, including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students, through the establishment of a teaching/research stream focused on the interactions between plants, gene expression and environmental cues. Students and fellows will have opportunities to present their research activity through scientific meetings and publications. This activity will also provide postdoctoral fellows and graduate students with training in teaching science in the laboratory environment. Activities also seek to engage undergraduate students and high school students in hands-on experience in the research laboratory setting.   <br/><br/><br/>Changes in temperature influence developmental programs in plants including flowering and vegetative growth. Two temperature-triggered responses in plants, response to the cold of winter and warmth-triggered responses, will be investigated. Interestingly, these two responses are mediated by two closely related Plant Homeo Domain (PHD)-finger containing proteins. Genetic and biochemical approaches to understand how these proteins mediate temperature-triggered responses will be addressed. Biochemical analyses and RNA-Seq analyses will be performed to construct regulatory networks that are mediated by PHD-finger proteins under different temperatures. PHD-finger motif is a histone binding module that recognizes and binds modified histones. The relationship between the function of PHD-finger proteins and histone modifications under different temperature will be investigated by ChIP-Seq analysis and molecular genetic approaches. Proposed research activity to dissect the molecular mechanism of temperature-triggered responses will be useful not only for understanding key mechanisms of plant development but also for elucidating the mechanism of genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression by environment changes."

In addition, certain species produce toxins and are capable of forming harmful algal blooms. Occurrences of these blooms are expected to increase in the future due to eutrophication and increasing temperatures. One of the factors controlling cyanobacterial populations is predation, but very little is known about the biochemical and genetic mechanisms governing the interactions between cyanobacteria and their predators. The researchers will identify cyanobacterial genes that affect their susceptibility to predators in order to understand predation mechanisms. This knowledge will be useful in guiding the management of recreational and drinking freshwater resources, and that of large scale outdoor culturing of cyanobacteria for biotechnological applications, which is often hampered by predators. Because toxic algal blooms are of general public interest, the researchers will incorporate aspects of this project into their teaching and outreach presentations to engage students and the public in the process of science and its application to environmental problems. They will also develop a module of classes for underrepresented high school students that will introduce them to the presence, abundance, and role of bacteria in aquatic environments. <br/><br/>This project concerns physiological mechanisms underlying the resistance of cyanobacteria to predation by protists. Specifically, the main objective of this project is to identify genes and processes governing the fitness of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus under selective pressure by amoebal and ciliate predators. The investigators have developed laboratory model systems to study grazing interactions and will study these interactions with state-of-the-art random barcode transposon mutagenesis (RB-TnSeq) and omics approaches, as well as genetic, biochemical, and physiological methods. Their preliminary work on amoebal grazing has pointed to the importance of several components of the cell surface in increasing fitness under grazing conditions. The investigators will build upon these preliminary findings and identify the mechanism of grazing resistance to amoebal predators in S. elongatus O-antigen mutants and other mutants disrupted in genes identified by RB-TnSeq. They will perform similar analyses to identify genes and processes affecting cyanobacterial fitness in the presence of a swimming ciliate grazer. These comparative studies will provide major insight into cyanobacterial strategies for evasion of predators.

This project focuses on Reelin, a large molecule that critically controls the embryonic formation of brain structures that contain different cell types organized into layers. Reelin also affects brain development after birth by promoting the maturation of cells, and the formation of connections that nerve cells make with each other (called synapses). Finally, in the adult and in old-aged brains, Reelin modulates the transmission of information at synapses, influencing cognitive brain function. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these diverse biological functions of Reelin are not well understood. The purpose of the present project is to address this knowledge gap by advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which Reelin affects mammalian brain development and function. The knowledge and materials generated by this study, including novel purified protein reagents and structural models, will be made available to the broad research community, accelerating the rate of discovery and promoting new scientific advances. This work will also benefit society by providing research training for undergraduate and graduate students, including women and other groups of people who are currently under-represented in science, fostering the development of a more diverse and globally competitive S.T.E.M. workforce.<br/><br/>Reelin is a large, modular secreted glycoprotein that controls many aspects of brain development and function, from neuronal migration at embryonic ages, to dendrite development, synapse formation, plasticity, and learning at postnatal ages. The mechanisms that mediate these biological functions are not well understood. A major obstacle that hindered progress in the field is the lack of availability of purified Reelin. This stems not only from the difficulty of expressing such a large glycoprotein, but also from the challenges associated with proteolytic cleavage events, which generate multiple protein isoforms. Through collaborative efforts and the establishment of novel protocols, the present research team was able to overcome this limitation, and has obtained large amounts of highly-purified, bioactive Reelin protein. The goals of the project are to: 1) characterize the three-dimensional structure of Reelin proteins by Cryo- Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET), protein crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering; 2) ; identify and characterize novel receptor(s) by a combination of biochemical and proteomic technologies such as  ELISA and mass spectrometry; 3) and identify signal transduction mechanisms that are elicited by these new receptors in distinct neuronal populations, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astroglia. Together, these experiments will either validate or rule out the main hypothesis guiding the work, that full-length Reelin and its physiological proteolytic fragments are bioactive ligands that affect brain development and function by engaging a variety of cell-surface receptors expressed by different cell types, and activating multiple signal transduction pathways. The approach followed here with Reelin may also provide a paradigm for gaining a deeper understand of other molecules that play a variety of roles in the brain from early development through adulthood and senescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the mechanisms that favor tissue regeneration in lieu of tissue repair remains one of the great unanswered questions in biology.  A particularly intriguing hypothesis, though poorly investigated, is that the loss of regenerative capacity in higher vertebrates coincides with the presence of a strong adaptive immune response.  Now, the recent discovery of complete tissue regeneration in wild African spiny mice (Acomys) compared to the failure to regenerate in a co-occurring rodent (Myomyscus), allows a comprehensive examination of the links between immunity and regeneration in wild, pathogen-exposed, and fully immunocompetent adult mammals.  Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that tradeoffs in immunity along (1) innate vs. adaptive and (2) pro vs. anti-inflammatory axes underlie variation in the ability and rate of regeneration between these wild species.  Quantifying immune and inflammatory changes at the cellular and molecular level in response to injury is expected to reveal a bias towards innate immunity and anti-inflammatory molecules in regenerators, and a shift towards adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory responses in non-regenerators.  Project results will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms that constrain regenerative ability in mammals.  <br/>Because regeneration biology is a fascinating topic with great potential to excite students about science, the investigators will engage U.S. and international students of all ages in the project.  Graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S. will travel to Kenya, where animal work will take place, to actively participate in the study and collaborate with Kenyan students and scientists.

Diapause is an internally regulated dormant state that allows insects to ""escape"" during seasons, such as winter, when the environmental conditions are harsh and unsuitable or normal growth and activity.  Diapause is characterized by changes in development, metabolism, and environmental stress resistance. Although there have been studies that characterized physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes that occur during diapause, the understanding of diapause regulation is far from being complete.  This research will provide new information about how diapause is regulated by investigating how small noncoding RNA molecules (microRNAs), regulate diapause. This study will improve our understanding of this important adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This research also has the potential to provide new tools for managing medically and economically important insects. For example, if microRNA function in insect diapause can block or induce diapause entry at a time of year that would be detrimental for their continued survival. This research has the potential to provide novel therapies for human medical disorders, such as cancer and diabetes, which share common, microRNA-associated regulatory mechanisms in humans and insects. Finally, the project will also provide integrative training and mentoring opportunities for multiple undergraduate students, while also broadly disseminating the findings to the public via informal science education to school children and families.<br/><br/>Studying insect diapause provides a conceptual frame work for understanding how insects, and other animals, perceive environmental cues and translate them into phenotypic changes that allow them to survive biotic and abiotic challenges they encounter. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, ~22 nucleotide, noncoding RNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, regulatory molecules that have important roles in diapause-relevant biological processes (e.g. developmental arrest, metabolic repression, and stress-resistance) in evolutionarily diverse species. Numerous miRNAs are deferentially regulated during pupal diapause in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, but their functional relevance is currently unknown. The aim of this project is to identify, and experimentally validate, mRNA targets of diapause-relevant miRNAs using computational and biochemical approaches. Specifically, the project focuses on miRNA:mRNA pairs that may have a role in environmental stress-resistance, a defining feature of the diapause phenotype.  It also investigates the evolutionary context of miRNA:mRNA regulatory networks and their contribution to the diapause phenotype in multiple insect species.

There are a variety of mechanisms by which sensory systems maximize the detection of stimuli that are important to the animal. However, the sensory environment is constantly changing. How can animals reliably detect behaviorally relevant sensory stimuli while also retaining the flexibility to adapt to changes in the sensory environment? One possible mechanism is synaptic plasticity in which the strengths of the synaptic connections between neurons are adjusted based on past experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that the intrinsic dynamics of neural networks induce synaptic plasticity that results in increased sensitivity to frequently encountered stimuli. Synaptic plasticity is found throughout the brain, but it is generally challenging to study directly in a living animal. The researchers capitalize on the unique experimental advantages of electric fish, in which it is possible to manipulate precisely and monitor the electrical activity of sensory neurons in an awake, behaving animal. In the context of social communication behavior, the researchers study how plasticity alters responses to sensory input, whether natural patterns of sensory input can induce this plasticity, and how this plasticity impacts the behavioral detection of stimuli. This research has broad implications by elucidating how sensory systems adjust to changing external conditions. In addition, electric fish are excellent tools for public outreach in neuroscience and behavior. As exotic animals, they attract a wide audience. The project includes ongoing outreach and education activities to teach K-12 students in the St. Louis region about hypothesis-driven science and the importance of brain plasticity in sensory perception and behavior.<br/><br/>Temporal codes have been implicated in sensory processing, cognition, and motor control. Recent studies reveal several mechanisms by which central sensory pathways decode temporal patterns. However, the sensory environment can change. A fundamental problem in sensory neuroscience is understanding how central circuits can robustly detect behaviorally relevant stimuli while retaining the flexibility to adapt to changes in the sensory environment. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), in which synaptic strength is adjusted as a function of the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spiking, is found in several brain regions across a wide diversity of species. However, its role in the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli remains controversial, largely because it is inherently difficult to link changes in synaptic strength at the cellular level to effects on behavior. The central hypothesis of this project is that STDP provides a mechanism for modifying network connectivity to adapt information processing to a changing sensory environment. The researchers address this hypothesis by using an integrative approach that capitalizes on the unique experimental advantages of electric fish, in which temporal patterns of spiking are themselves the behaviorally relevant stimulus. Using a combination of neurophysiology, imaging, and behavior, the researchers are determining how STDP alters responses to sensory input in awake and behaving animals, how natural patterns of sensory input can elicit STDP, and how these changes impact behavioral stimulus detection. The project includes outreach and education efforts that target K-12 students in the St. Louis region to teach them about brain plasticity and how the scientific method can be used to address questions about how brains control behavior. As part of the outreach, researchers lead hands-on activities that include experiments with freely behaving fish, psychophysical experiments on participants, and multimedia demonstrations to illustrate brain plasticity and its role in modifying behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal, state of the art high-resolution optical imaging and electrical recording methods will be used to measure neural activity in animals as they engage in vocal learning and communication.  This project will determine how populations of interconnected neurons that are necessary to vocal communication encode vocal elements and sequences.   Accomplishing this goal is essential to understanding the neural basis of communication and also has other important potential benefits, including the ability to diagnose and ultimately repair brain pathologies that impair perception or movement, and to design machines that emulate these processes.

This project blends leading edge methods, including multiphoton calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and intracellular recordings and genetic manipulations in singing birds, to explore the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that encode learned vocalizations.  Until now, it has been impractical to interrogate how the brain encodes sensory and motor representations of such complex behaviors with cellular and synaptic resolution."

Finally, the award will also support hands-on activities for schoolchildren to spark their interest in science. <br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that the spinal cord uses a combination of behaviorally specialized and multifunctional nerve cells (interneurons) to generate movements, but how it does so for limb movements is unknown. This project will study how specialized and multifunctional spinal interneurons contribute to producing two kinds of leg movements, swimming and scratching. The turtle is the only animal for which this is now feasible and is ideal for such studies because turtles, being diving animals, have evolved unusual resistance to low-oxygen conditions such as occur during many physiological experiments. The project will investigate the roles of one previously identified class of behaviorally specialized interneurons, scratch-specialized neurons, and one previously identified class of multifunctional interneurons, transverse interneurons. The project will determine whether each of these two classes of interneurons is excitatory or inhibitory, based on the neurotransmitter it uses, and whether it makes synaptic connections directly with motor neurons, using a combination of intracellular electrophysiology in vivo, dye injection, and immunocytochemistry.  The results of this study will reveal aspects of the organization of the spinal cord networks of neurons that generate different kinds of limb movements. The conclusions are likely to be broadly applicable to vertebrates, including humans, because the spinal cord is an evolutionarily conserved structure."

Passive sensory systems such as vision require little energy input from the animal because the carrier signal (light) comes from the sun. Active sensory and communication systems such as echolocation in bats are advantageous because they do not require external energy sources, but these animals must expend energy to produce the acoustic carrier signal. Managing these energetic demands and responding to energy shortfalls is essential for their survival and reproductive fitness. Running out of energy to generate the signal renders the sensory system ""blind"" and makes it impossible to find food, respond to threats from competitors, or attract mates.  The energetic demands of sensing and communicating are extreme in some species of electric fish - animals that generate and sense electric fields in the surrounding water to image their worlds and communicate in darkness.  This project aims to elucidate the organizing principles that allow animals to manage and exploit energetically expensive sensory and communication channels. The investigator will adapt knowledge, software, and technical approaches developed from this project's research activities to improve science literacy and education regionally, nationally, and internationally.  <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that energetic demands are a major force shaping the operation and regulation of active sensing at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels using the weakly electric fish, Eingenmannia viriscens, as a model system.  The research plan will study the electric organ discharge produced by the synchronized action potentials of specialized electric organ cells called electrocytes to (1) discover how hormones regulate electric signal intensity under normal conditions and in response to metabolic stress,  (2) discover how the cells that generate the electric signal increase their energy efficiency and respond to energy shortfalls, and (3) identify molecular adaptations in the electric organ cells' ion channels and ion pumps that optimize energy utilization. This project will integrate research and education through investigating the mechanisms that allow animals to use metabolically demanding sensory and communication signals. This project's educational component will achieve four educational goals that extend the investigator's track record of integrating research and teaching: (1) expanding and improving the investigator's outreach program, ""The Electric Fish Roadshow"", that promotes scientific literacy in settings ranging from grade-school classrooms to retirement communities [www.markhamlab.com/outreach.html].  (2) extending the scope and distribution of grade-school and middle-school lesson plans regionally and nationally, as well as international deployment of educational software for high-school and college neurobiology classes [www.EOTNprogram.org], (3) transforming the way student scientist-educators are trained in the investigator's laboratory and, (4) developing an undergraduate laboratory class in the investigator's department that involves students directly in high-level research activities related to the project's research goals."

Migratory birds are excellent model systems for investigating such integrative questions because migratory birds are impressive endurance athletes that use primarily fats to fuel their flights, and diet strongly influences fatty acid composition of stored fat that in turn affects whole-animal energetics during exercise. Reliance on fatty acid oxidation to fuel high-intensity endurance exercise in birds is remarkable in part because it increases oxidative stress which must be dealt with by the bird's antioxidant defense system. In fact, human health requires a ready supply of dietary antioxidants to combat the free radicals produced as part of normal metabolism, and much contemporary medical research is focused on understanding how dietary antioxidants promote human health. The primary goals of the two proposed research projects are to experimentally determine how certain essential fatty acids stimulate fat metabolism in exercising birds, how the antioxidant defense system of birds responds to the increased oxidative stress associated with exercise, and how this interaction between fat metabolism and antioxidant defenses depends on changes in seasonal demands during fall and spring migration. <br/><br/>The proposed research builds on the successful collaborative research and teaching programs at a primarily undergraduate (Sacred Heart University) and R1 research (University of Rhode Island) institution. The proposed research will allow URI graduate students to learn fatty acid analysis at SHU, and SHU undergraduates will help URI researchers with field work, captive bird studies, and laboratory analyses for measuring plasma metabolites as indicators of health in wild birds. The two PIs will continue their tradition of training undergraduate and graduate students by utilizing URI's enhancing diversity initiatives and SHU's collaborative with the inner-city Bridgeport (CT) public school system. The proposed research will also strengthen established collaborations with biologists in southern New England working for NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy, Audubon, and local land trusts as well as international collaborations (jointly supported by NSF International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section) with colleagues at the Advance Facility for Avian Research, University of Western Ontario, and Max Plank Institute for Ornithology, Germany. Currently, there is much public interest in dietary antioxidants and how they promote human health. Migratory birds offer an interesting model system for studying the role of dietary antioxidants and fats on fat metabolism during exercise because birds have relatively low rates of free radical production in spite of higher metabolic rates and much higher maximum longevity than mammals of similar body size.  In addition, patterns of bird migration have been implicated in the dispersal of disease (e.g. avian flu) and migratory bird populations are declining due to the loss of suitable habitat for stopover sites during their migration.  The PIs longstanding collaborative field studies in southern New England guarantees the results will continue to be used for land conservation and management efforts."

An intricate network of more than 100 regulatory genes is known to be involved at the top level. The role of this ""managerial"" network, however, is primarily to make decisions, not to do any of the actual work. It was recently discovered that proper development requires that a small group of cells in the embryo send a message to another group, the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), using a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PMCs are the cells that lay down the skeleton, and once given the word, they do this pretty much on their own. The research team hopes to learn how PMCs respond to the ""go""-signal they receive from other cells, what genetic programs they run that affect the shape of the skeleton, and what kind of behavioral and structural changes result from running these programs. In the big picture, this would help understand how top-level decisions in the cell lead to actual changes in cell behavior and the emergence of a skeleton with complex architecture, and will hopefully contribute to an understanding of how such mechanisms evolve. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules for undergraduate engineering students, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab.<br/><br/>Spiculogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, i.e. formation of the endoskeleton by primary mesenchyme cells (PMC), is the result of a stereotypical sequence of morphogenetic events. Key steps include an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, patterning, and cell-cell fusion. In the late gastrula stage, PMC syncytia begin secreting the endoskeleton. While the current model of the skeletogenic gene regulatory network (GRN) is arguably one of the best understood in any organism, there is currently a gap in our understanding of how the high-level GRN circuitry is integrated with regulation of complex cellular behavior. Recent work identified the importance of ectoderm-derived factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The Principal Investigator and collaborators discovered that a recombinant VEGF has a dramatic concentration-dependent effect on the shape of spicules deposited by PMC in vitro. Triradiates, i.e. branching spicules that closely resemble those initially deposited in the embryo, require a threshold concentration of rVEGF. Below this concentration, markedly different spicule shapes are formed. VEGF is, thus, an important extrinsic regulator of morphogenetic events in PMC. The research team will therefore perform a series of in vitro experiments that aim to unravel the role of VEGF signaling in PMCs. Specifically, they will: a) determine the influence of rVEGF concentration on the skeletogenic GRN and its downstream circuitry by a combination of quantitative PCR and deep sequencing; b) investigate the effect of VEGF on cell behavior before the onset of spiculogenesis, including proliferation, survival, motility, and patterning, and c) study the effect of VEGF on ultrastructure, specifically cytoskeletal rearrangement, in the PMC syncytium. The proposed research will not only help integrate a mechanistic view of PMC skeletal morphogenesis by connecting top-level regulatory circuits with more proximal control over cellular behavior, but also provide a basis for understanding how such regulatory networks evolve to give rise to different morphological features.  Since VEGF is also a key player in the development of vascular, nervous, and tracheal networks, this research may help discern functions of this ligand during evolution. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules that cast sea urchin skeletal morphogenesis in the context of an entry-level chemical and biological engineering/materials science class, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab."

Because gut bacteria play such vital roles in host health, a detailed understanding of how bacteria colonize the gut and how biological and biophysical factors affect the stability and longevity of their symbiotic existence with the host is of enormous significance.  One often overlooked factor that may play a significant role in structuring gut-associated bacterial communities is the presence of viruses, specifically phages (viruses that infect bacteria). The investigators have developed a simple marine invertebrate model system (the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis) that affords the opportunity to dissect numerous aspects of host:bacteria symbiosis, such as initial colonization, effects of feeding and digestion, and interactions with the host immune system. In this project, they will test the hypothesis that phages serve important roles in shaping overall bacterial community structure through their ability to break apart specific hosts, thereby releasing dissolved organics and facilitating gene transfer among hosts, and driving microbial evolution. By carefully examining phage-bacteria interactions both in vitro and within the gut of the sea squirt, they will gain unprecedented insight into the effects of phages on bacterial communities living within animal guts. This research will benefit society by exploring the promise of phages for remodeling complex microbial communities, which has important implications for human health, bioremediation, and ecosystem restoration projects.  The investigators will develop an outreach program that encourages high school students to undertake mentored science fair projects encompassing microbial ecology concepts and provide hands-on training in molecular microbiology techniques. To reach a distinct target audience, they will also run microbial ecology modules for Girl Scouts, Girls Incorporated, and the University of South Florida's Oceanography Camp for Girls.<br/><br/>To examine the roles of phages in shaping the overall structure and function of bacterial communities, the investigators will accomplish three specific research objectives:  1) characterize phage diversity in the Ciona gut using culture-based and culture independent methods, 2) dissect phage-bacteria interactions in vitro and determine if phages can modify bacterial community (microbiome) structure in experimentally colonized Ciona, and 3) culture Ciona in both the presence and absence of phages in the water to determine the effects of phage presence on gut microbiomes and host physiology.  As a filter-feeding sessile organism, Ciona  directly interfaces with the marine environment and encounters a continuous stream of microbes that can potentially colonize or influence its gut flora.  Previous work with adult, field-harvested, Ciona indicated that a consistent, ""core"" microbiome dominates their gut. Additionally, they have successfully cultured various members of the core gut microbiome, isolated phages for some of these bacteria, and are studying the process of extracellular biofilm formation by these bacteria on artificially constructed matrices that resemble the surface of the gut epithelium in the presence and absence of phages.  Ciona is a highly tractable experimental system  that can be grown under predominantly sterile conditions, allowing experimental control of of nearly every aspect of the symbiotic conversation between host, bacteria, and phages.  The results of this work have the transformative potential of redefining our understanding of the factors that shape the establishment and maintenance of stable, host-associated, bacterial communities and in turn affect the physiology of the host itself."

However the mechanisms leading to its formation are poorly understood. These studies aims to identify and understand the function of novel essential players involved in that process and to characterize the molecular activities that are involved during the different developmental steps leading to the formation of the structure that produces the LR axis. <br/><br/>The establishment of LR asymmetry in the zebrafish embryo depends on the activity of motile cilia, present on an epithelium inside a fluid-filled organ called Kupffer's vesicle (KV) that generates a vectorial leftward fluid flow. Formation and differentiation of the KV have been shown to be regulated by several signaling pathways but very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the formation and differentiation of the KV from its precursors, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). This project will characterize the function of novel key players amongst the small set of transcription factors involved in the regulation of KV organogenesis. It will define the developmental step(s) in KV formation that require a functional TEAD1a-Vgll4l transcription complex and identify its relationship with signaling pathways and transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in the formation and/or function of the KV. This project will also generate a complete description of the transcriptome of DFCs and the KV at the different developmental steps of KV organogenesis. It will provide a detailed description of the temporal dynamics of gene expression as well as of the specific role of the transcription factors involved in the KV organogenesis, bringing us close to a complete description, at the molecular level, of the formation of a simple but essential organ of a vertebrate embryo.<br/>This project will offer one post-doctoral fellow and two undergraduate students opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research in Developmental Biology and will expose students at all levels of education to the scientific process.

This research will test the hypothesis that interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have pervasive effects on gene expression that scale up to differences in metabolic capacity and performance. To test this hypothesis, the stress response will be investigated in larvae from populations that differ with respect to mitochondrial and nuclear genetic background and that occur along a latitudinal and steep altitudinal temperature gradients. Larvae will be reared at a high elevation laboratory in chambers where oxygen level and temperature will be manipulated. At the end of the growth period, larvae reared under these different conditions will be exposed to different temperatures and running speed measured. Genetic variation associated with fast and slow running speed after stress will be identified using whole genome sequencing of individuals in the upper and lower tails of the running speed distribution. Differences in expression of genes of interest will be assessed using RNA sequencing for these same individuals. Genes of interest (e.g. stress, hypoxia, central metabolism) that have non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation along natural temperature or elevation gradients will be identified in whole genome sequencing experiments and used to build 'SNP panels' in which larger numbers of individuals can be screened. Rearing conditions described above will then be used to generate larvae in which metabolic physiology will be examined. Metabolic enzyme activity, mitochondrial respiration, oxidative damage and thermal tolerance will be measured, SNP variation recorded, and differential expression of genes of interest quantified using quantitative PCR. Taken together, this research will reveal how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes interact to cope with stress in a changing environment.

Fungal decomposition of wood is a critical component of the carbon cycle, impacts soil productivity, and has the potential to be exploited in the production of biofuels and other 'green' technologies. The major wood-decaying fungi are mushroom-forming (Agaricomycetes). The physical characteristics and chemical composition of wood vary among plant species, and most wood-decaying Agaricomycetes have characteristic wood substrate ranges. However, it is not understood why individual species of wood decaying fungi tend to occur on specific plant hosts. This project will investigate the mechanisms of substrate specificity and substrate switching in wood-decaying Agaricomycetes using a combination of analyses of genes expressed during decay, and physical and chemical characterization of the decay process. Fungal enzymes that are involved in wood decay or degradation have potential applications in emerging bioprocesses, such as energy-related bioconversions, including biofuel production, and bioremediation. Enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that allow different species of fungi to exploit particular wood substrates could help guide development of genetic resources that could be used for such applied purposes. This project will support one Postdoctoral Fellow and two graduate students, and will provide training to undergraduates at three collaborating academic institutions in the US. To bring information about fungi and wood decomposition to a wide audience, this project will create interactive exhibits and develop accompanying public programs at the Worcester EcoTarium (http://www.ecotarium.org/), a science and nature museum which serves over 140,000 visitors annually including large numbers of students from regional public schools. Exhibits will illustrate fungal diversity, the decay process, and the role of fungi in the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on four species of Agaricomycetes (with distinct substrate preferences) with available genome sequences.

Phylogenomic analyses will make use of all available genomes of wood-decaying Agaricomycetes, focusing on gene families that are likely to play a role in decay, as informed by expression profiles. Physical and chemical characteristics of decay will be addressed using microscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical analyses of colonized substrates. The proposed research is a collaboration between researchers with expertise in fungal systematics and molecular evolution, wood decay and forest products pathology, fungal genomics, and genetics and biochemistry of decay systems. This project will capitalize on recent advances in genomics of wood-decaying basidiomycetes.

This project, performed at Louisiana State University, uses an integrative approach at multiple levels of biological organization to further our understanding of how the brain processes multimodal (visual and acoustic) sensory information, and how it links this perception to behavioral outputs in reproductive contexts. Experiments will be performed in an African cichlid fish, in which brightly-colored dominant males perform visually-conspicuous courtship displays combined with sounds to attract females for spawning. How this multimodal information is used by receptive females remains unexplored. Results of this work will advance our current understanding of the function and evolution of multimodal signaling and perception that is crucial for all species survival and persistence in a changing world. This project will also provide research and training opportunities for women and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, science web-resources for the public and other research scientists, and curriculum development for undergraduate courses. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify and characterize the neural substrates mediating reproductive behavioral decisions based on reception of salient multimodal signals. Capitalizing on previous sensory research in an established African cichlid fish model, Astatotilapia burtoni, this work combines behavioral, cellular, and molecular analyses to advance our understanding of how multimodal (visual and acoustic) signals are represented in the brain of a receiver. Further, it will examine how perception of this salient information is influenced by an animal's reproductive state. Immediate early gene expression will be used as a proxy for neural activation to determine where in the female brain multimodal signals from courting males are processed, and to test whether female reproductive state influences neural activation patterns. Complementary experiments will determine the role of the subpallial forebrain as an integration center for socially-salient multimodal signals and reproductive state. This work combines in vivo electrophysiology and gene expression analyses to test the hypothesis that the ventral telencephalon plays a role in visual-acoustic processing during courtship. Analysis of multimodal responses using these two different techniques in the same brain regions will generate novel measures of both transcriptional and physiological activation to the same contextual information. Results of this work will transform previously outlined behavioral classification schemes of multimodal communication theory and will be used as a framework to advance the field, while simultaneously providing outreach and training opportunities for students from K-12 through college."

For instance, it is now known that the same cell communication pathways control the development of diverse species, including C. elegans, and mammals like mice and humans.  This collaborative project investigates the role of one of these conserved pathways in C. elegans development, focusing on asymmetric stem cell divisions. It will extend these studies to the most well-established mammalian example of a stem cell population, intestinal stem cells. In this way, it will determine the extent to which existing models of control of C. elegans stem cell divisions are conserved in mammals. Thus the research will provide a strong framework to address common problems that stem cells in these distantly-related animals encounter. The project will broaden the impact of these studies by 1) increasing public engagement and science literacy through hands-on workshops geared toward the general public, 2) recruiting the next generation of STEM scientists by bringing 8th graders from rural Iowa communities with large Hispanic populations to campus for a day of career simulations and 3) retaining current STEM undergraduates by extending undergraduate research opportunities, including to disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. <br/><br/><br/>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) drives cell fate specification in animals from mammals to nematodes. Stem cells in these organisms use ACD to generate a differentiated daughter and a new stem cell. Wnt signaling is a conserved regulator of ACD and cell fate through its control of the transcriptional activator beta-catenin. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of beta-catenin regulation during asymmetric stem cell divisions by analyzing regulation of the C. elegans beta-catenin, SYS-1, and to begin testing the resulting mechanisms in mammals. C. elegans is well-suited for these analyses because of its genetic and molecular tools, in vivo ACD imaging, the separation of the signaling and adhesion functions of beta-catenin into distinct genes and because of recent findings that SYS-1 is negatively regulated by homologs of the beta-catenin destruction complex: Axin, APC and CK1alpha. The mammalian intestinal crypt, arguably the best-known example of Wnt-controlled stem cell maintenance, will be used to test conservation of SYS 1 regulatory mechanisms and will also inform the worm models. This project will determine the mechanism by which Axin localizes the destruction complex, and the extent to which destruction complex regulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus is conserved. The results of these studies are predicted to provide broadly important insight into developmental cell fate specification and the role of Wnt pathway-induced ACD in tissue homeostasis."

This research addresses several fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms that produce unique characteristics among closely related species, and how these mechanisms have changed over time to produce variation in these traits.  Dr. Masly and colleagues have developed several powerful resources in different fruit fly species that will allow them to identify the genes that underlie variation in the sizes and shapes of reproductive traits, and to understand how these genes function differently during the development of these traits to ultimately give rise to the distinctive characteristics of different species.  The results of this work promise to inform our understanding of how genes control tissue growth and will provide insights into broader biological processes including the generation of biodiversity.  These research activities also make several substantial contributions to education and community outreach.  In particular, they provide transformative educational opportunities in science and technology for Native American students enrolled at two-year Tribal Colleges, and also for students enrolled at Dr. Masly's institution.  The goal of these educational activities is to provide students with multidisciplinary training in genetics, development, evolution, and the use of cutting-edge imaging technologies.  This will bolster undergraduate training in the molecular biosciences within the state of Oklahoma and provide its burgeoning biotechnology industry with a well-trained workforce. <br/><br/><br/>Understanding the mechanisms that generate biodiversity, and how these mechanisms evolve at the molecular level, are major goals of biology.  A particularly striking example of biodiversity is the remarkable variation in the morphology of reproductive structures observed among closely related species of animals.  It is thought that phenotypic change generally occurs by co-option or loss of entire gene regulatory networks (GRNs) or by variation of gene expression levels within GRNs.  However, genetic mapping studies suggest that changes in GRN architecture itself may contribute to the extraordinarily rapid evolution of complex structures.  The research objective is to dissect the genetic and developmental bases of species-specific reproductive morphology to understand how structural evolution occurs at the earliest stages of species divergence.  This will be accomplished by taking advantage of a unique set of recombinant genetic lines and several novel transgenic reagents in 'non-model' Drosophila species.  Dr. Masly's group will use these tools to identify and functionally characterize the genes that specify species variation in reproductive structure morphology and understand how variation among these loci directs developmental differences in real time.  The educational objective is to use this research as a vehicle to engage undergraduate students in integrative biological research, with the ultimate goal of transforming the research experience and culture at Dr. Masly's institution and at Native American Tribal Colleges within Oklahoma.  This will be accomplished by incorporating the research activities as the focus of a new inquiry-driven undergraduate course, and an intensive summer research program that provides Native students with access to STEM resources and training."

It is known that the expression of genes is controlled in part by chemical modifications to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the proteins that surround the DNA. These so-called 'epigenetic modifications' result in heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself. Recent findings show that epigenetic modifications play pivotal roles in organismal development, physiology, and behavior, and are implicated in human diseases from cancer to complex behavioral disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. One such epigenetic modification is the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in DNA (DNA methylation). Variable DNA methylation at gene regulatory regions can influence gene expression. DNA methylation typically promotes gene repression, whereas DNA demethylation promotes gene activation. However, the patterns and functions of DNA methylation in the brain during development, and the factors that control DNA methylation are poorly understood. The Principal Investigator (PI) recently discovered that TH, which is known to be critical for normal development of the central nervous system, controls DNA methylation in the developing brain. Here, he will examine the mechanism of DNA methylation by TH and its consequences for neurological development using the frog as model system. The project also will involve training of a diverse scientific workforce, establishment of an undergraduate course in experimental design for life scientists, and science outreach activities with middle school students and with adults at retirement communities. <br/><br/>The specific aims of this project are to: 1) map DNA methylation patterns in the developing brain using genome-wide analyses including RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and methyl capture sequencing, 2) determine the mechanisms by which TH regulates DNA methylation using targeted analysis of TH-dependent recruitment of enzymes to chromatin, and 3) understand the consequences of TH regulation of DNA methylation for neurological development through analysis of cell cycle control.  The PI will focus on metamorphosis of the frog Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis, a well studied TH-dependent process. They will conduct genome-wide methylation and transcription factor association analyses to investigate the patterns and roles of DNA methylation during postembryonic brain development. The results of the proposed research will provide a deeper understanding of factors that modulate the epigenetic landscape in neural cells, and will open new avenues for research on the regulation and roles of DNA methylation in neurological development and function."

Exceptional navigation is not limited to animals with large brains, like birds and mammals. It can also be found in animals with simpler nervous systems. The tropical amblypygid, a scorpion-like animal, is able to find its way home at night over distances exceeding 10 meters through dense, tropical forest understory.  The study of how different types of sensory information (visual, chemical, tactile) are processed by amblypygids as they solve navigation problems can reveal fundamental design properties of simple nervous systems that are somehow capable of controlling complex, learned behavior. These design properties can inspire engineering solutions applicable to robotic and artificial intelligence systems. The study of charismatic tropical amblypygids also serves as an alluring gateway for teachers to introduce K-12 students to the importance of neuroscience for understanding how organisms acquire and process information from their environment and how this information influences learning, memory and associated behavior. To support engagement with K-12 students, their teachers and the general public, researchers will, among other activities, develop internet-based educational materials in both English and Spanish and develop various scientific inquiry activities for science events. <br/><br/>By conducting behavioral experiments that assess amblypygid (Phrynus pseudoparvulus) movements after they are displaced from a home refuge, researchers will assess the relative importance of visual, chemical and mechanical information in supporting navigation. These experiments will either involve manipulation of animal sense organs or the sensory cues in their environment. The neurobiological work will focus on a brain area known as the ""mushroom bodies"", which are thought to support spatial memory. In parallel with the behavioral work, researchers will explore the nervous system routes by which information from different sensory stimuli is sent to the mushroom bodies. Particular attention will be given to how the mushroom bodies ""engineer"" or ""integrate"" the different sensory inputs.  The integration of sensory inputs is hypothesized to be necessary to support complex navigation and will likely be crucial for the design of any sophisticated artificial system. Finally, the importance of the mushroom bodies in navigation, and their capacity to combine different sources of sensory information, will be tested under the same conditions of the behavioral experiments noted above, except using animals whose mushroom bodies are impaired."

Their populations are regulated by many viral diseases, and arthropods also vector many viruses that cause important diseases of plants and animals. Thus, interactions between arthropods and viruses in nature are ubiquitous and important. In most insect-virus interactions, a virus enters the insect by the oral route and must penetrate the cells of the insect's gut in order to have access to the other cells and tissues of the insect. Although it is a critical step in the biological interaction, very little is known about how viruses move through insect midgut cells. The proposed studies will examine those interactions, focusing on the mechanisms of directional (polarized) viral transit through the epithelial cells of the insect midgut. For these studies, a combination of cultured cells and transgenic Drosophila will be used, and combined with a variety of genetic and molecular approaches, to discover the cellular proteins that interact with and direct viral proteins across the insect gut cells. Broader impacts of these studies of virus-insect interactions in the insect midgut will include applications in diverse areas such as agricultural crop protection, forestry, animal science, and human medicine. Understanding the specific viral signals and interacting midgut cell proteins and pathways that regulate or restrict virus trafficking through midgut cells can be used to both enhance infection by beneficial viruses (such as biocontrol agents in agriculture) and to inhibit viral transmission in insect vectors of plant and animal diseases. <br/><br/>Many plant and animal viruses are vectored by insects, and insects are also infected by a number of pathogenic viruses. Typically, after the virus is consumed orally, the virus enters and replicates in polarized epithelial cells of the insect midgut. Polarized trafficking of viral components delivers the virus particle or components for assembly, to the basal membranes of the midgut cell where the virus may assemble and exit the cell by budding. Virus transport across insect midgut epithelial cells is not well understood even in the best characterized systems, and little is known about the mechanistic nature of polarized protein transport in the insect gut, due to the difficult nature of experimental manipulation in this tissue. This project will utilize an innovative experimental design that leverages two powerful model systems for identifying specific proteins, pathways, and signals involved in virus-midgut trafficking. Using ectopic expression of viral proteins in Drosophila midgut cells followed by RNAi screens using libraries of RNAi fly strains, and high throughput analysis of a Drosophila cell line, entire candidate pathways will be screened to identify specific proteins and pathways necessary for polarized trafficking of two model viral proteins in the midgut. To identify protein signals necessary for midgut trafficking, an extensively studied viral protein (baculovirus GP64) will be analyzed in a natural host insect, the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni. The identification of viral protein signals and midgut proteins and pathways that mediate and regulate targeted trafficking will generate new paradigms for understanding pathogen-insect interactions."

The present research project is conducted in zebrafish because of advantageous genetic and experimental tools available for studying early eye development. Previous studies carried out by this research team found two proteins that need to function properly for retinas to develop (called DCBLD1 and DCBLD2); if these proteins aren't made, retinas don't form properly.  Replacing a defective fish DBCLD2 protein with a human DCBLD2 protein enables the fish retina to develop normally, suggesting that DCBLD proteins function in a similar manner in all animals with backbones. The present project will examine the mechanisms by which DCBLD proteins govern proper retina formation using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, cell biological, functional genetic and proteomic techniques, and will provide a more complete understanding of retina formation.  Broader impacts of this research include laboratory training for high school students, university undergraduates, graduate students, and staff scientists in many modern experimental approaches. Several of the students will be specifically recruited from populations that are underrepresented in science. The research and training will be conducted by an inter-disciplinary team in Vermont (the University of Vermont and Norwich University), Massachusetts (Boston College) and Puerto Rico (the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras and the Metropolitan University).<br/><br/>Previous work by the principal investigators determined that the putative neuronal guidance receptors DCBLD1 and 2 act as scaffolds for the Crk family of adaptors, which are known to play important roles in the positioning of neurons during development.

They have huge economic value as fisheries, storm barriers and destinations for ecotourism.  Corals are made up of large numbers of interconnected animal hosts, called polyps that house microscopic algae inside their cells.  This partnership, or symbiosis, is the foundation of the entire coral reef ecosystem. The polyps receive photosynthetic nutrients from the algae, and the algae receive nutrients from the polyps.  While a great deal of attention has been focused on the environmental threats to corals, there remains only a partial understanding of the microscale cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that underpin the coral-algal symbiosis. Insight into regulation of this symbiosis will provide a stronger foundation for studies of coral health and coral stress, such as coral bleaching in which the host polyps lose their symbiotic algae.  This project will bring together a diverse team of coral biologists, cell biologists and geneticists to study a small sea anemone that serves as an excellent proxy for corals, which do not survive well in the lab, are slow growing, and difficult to collect because of their endangered status.  In contrast, the fast-growing, weedy sea anemone Aiptasia will enable the researchers to make rapid progress on the study of coral symbiosis.  This award is focused on technique development and swift dissemination of results through online communication platforms to both the scientific community and the public.  A variety of genetic techniques will be developed, including gene editing in both partners to be able to test hypotheses about the involvement of specific genes in coral health and stress.  To increase the effectiveness and efficiency of research efforts to understand the cellular, molecular and genetic foundations of this symbiosis, the researchers will develop and optimize approaches to rear the complete life cycle of Aiptasia in the laboratory.  This award will contribute to the training of scientists and expose school-aged children and the general public to coral reef and symbiosis science.<br/><br/>The ecological, economic, and aesthetic importance of coral reefs is widely recognized, as are the threats they face from environmental stress. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular and cell biology of corals and their resident endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) that are critical for host nutrition remain poorly understood. A major reason for this paucity of knowledge is the lack of methods for mutant isolation and analysis, gene knockdown, gene knockout, and gene tagging. Without these, even powerful genomic and transcriptomic analysis largely yield correlations whose implications for causal mechanisms remain uncertain. This project focuses on development of approaches to test gene function in a rapidly developing model system, the sea anemone Aiptasia and the Symbiodinium minutum (Clade B1) strain SSB01, which can form a stable endosymbiosis with Aiptasia, and can grow well in culture. Genetic manipulation in SSB01 and in small polyps will include morpholino and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to achieve gene knockdown, knockout and gene tagging.  The researchers will identify and test compounds from natural substrates and biofilms to achieve larval settlement, and will identify and test anemone neuropeptides as a means to achieve metamorphosis of Aiptasia routinely in the laboratory. Finally, a set of interwoven communications platforms and activities will be developed to rapidly disseminate information gained in the project to the broader scientific community."

Two common environmental stressors of plants are flooding and drought. Successful completion of the proposed objectives will validate the function of novel genes and associated pathways that that allow the plant to live through periods of prolonged flooding, and paradoxically, also allow plants to survive drought conditions. The researchers and their colleagues have discovered that, while most types of rice die after three days of complete submergence during flooding, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) gene can tolerate this stress, and live through severe flooding events.  This project will explore how the SUB1 gene, and the genes that it interacts with, are able to promote tolerance to flooding and to drought.  The proposed experiments are also expected to lead to important new insights into plant biology with applications to agricultural productivity in one of the world's most important crops. The lead researcher, Ronald, serves as the faculty director of the UC Davis World Food Center's Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy, where she will continue her work to engage the public on issues related to plant genetics and the science and technology of food production. Students at levels from high school interns to postdoctoral fellows, will be involved in carrying out the work and in outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Whereas most rice plants die after three days of complete submergence, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) locus are tolerant. The Ronald laboratory and collaborators demonstrated that the rice SUB1 locus encodes three Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators, SUB1A, SUB1B, and SUB1C and that overexpression of the SUB1A is sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant rice varieties. The SUB1 locus has also been shown to promote plant survival during drought. The Ronald lab further demonstrated that an uncharacterized member of the OsGTgamma-2 family of GT factors, a novel SANT domain-containing protein called SAB18, (SUB1A BINDING PROTEIN 18), binds SUB1A in yeast. SAB18 overexpression confers SUB1A-dependent enhanced submergence tolerance and remarkably robust drought tolerance. Furthermore SUB1/SAB18ox plants display a reduction of leaf water loss and lipid peroxidation indicating that SAB18 enhances oxidative stress tolerance. The Ronald lab also isolated three fast neutron (FN)-irradiated mutants that serve as SUPPRESSORS OF STRESS TOLERANCE MEDIATED BY SUB1 (sst). The researchers hypothesize that SAB18 positively regulates SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance by forming a protein complex with SUB1A, which binds and activates the promoters of SUB1A, SAB18 and/or genes conferring stress tolerance. It is further hypothesized that the genes encoded by the sst locus are required for these activities. To test these models the researchers propose to: 1) Identify genes and pathways regulated by SAB18. 2) Determine the mechanism of action of SAB18/SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance. 3) Characterize three sst mutants and identify the genes corresponding to the mutations using a whole genome resequencing approach."

Less well-understood is the fact that plants have very complex light perception systems that relate to, but are separable from photosynthesis. These systems allow plants to perceive their constantly changing light environment and make appropriate developmental ""decisions"", influencing everything from when to germinate to the patterns of growth and the timing of reproduction. Thus, discovering how these light perception systems mechanistically function is absolutely essential for understanding plants in both highly manipulated agricultural settings and more natural ecosystems. Many scientists have investigated these processes and much is known about how specific photoreceptors perceive individual wavelengths of light and relay this information within the plant. It is well-understood that perception of different wavelengths of light causes massive and rapid alterations in gene expression, resulting in visually obvious changes to the plant, such as increased stem elongation in far red light conditions. The Holt Lab recently discovered several new genes that regulate the point at which light signals are turned into changes in gene expression. This NSF award will allow them to further explore the mechanistic basis for these functions - i.e., they will extend their discovery process from the ""who"" to the ""how"". The proposed research will include training and mentoring of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students in cutting edge genetic and biochemical research. Additionally, the PI will participate in an annual freshman mentoring program for incoming science majors, host two summer REU undergraduate students in each funded year, and incorporate aspects of the research into an undergraduate course in plant physiology.<br/><br/>While our mechanistic understanding of light signaling pathways has matured greatly in recent years, there is evidence that not all of the photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors have been identified. For example, far red light is primarily perceived by the phyA photoreceptor and this pathway terminates in the activation of a number of well-characterized transcription factors, in particular HFR1, HY5, and LAF1. However, even triple mutant plants for these genes do not fully recapitulate the phenotypes of phyA mutants or plants grown in the dark. NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factors were recently identified as additional components of several light signaling pathways, especially far red light. Additionally, these genes appear to signal at least partially, if not completely, independent of HY5. Thus, the principal research objective supported by this funding is to test the hypothesis that NF-Y transcription factors regulate a previously non-described far red light signaling pathway, operating in parallel, but independent to the well-described HFR1, HY5, and LAF1 transcription factors. The specific aims of the project are directed towards directly testing this hypothesis, mechanistically exploring NF-Y function related to the proteasome, and use of a suppressor screen to provide a broader context for NF-Y signaling during photomorphogenesis."

Many conifer species have recently experienced extreme mortality events due to drought, fire and insect outbreaks. There is an urgent need to understand conifer physiology, and especially conifer needles - the organs responsible for carbon uptake and regulation of water loss. Conifers have an intriguing paradox in the link between their leaf anatomy and physiology: with such a simplistic, single-vein vascular system, how can they compete with broadleaf species or inhabit extreme environments? This project aims to understand how conifer leaf anatomy influences water transport and photosynthesis, and how needle water transport declines during drought. This information will then be used to develop a mechanistic model to help predict forest productivity and mortality in response to drought and other environmental challenges. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students. Also, in collaboration with the McCall Outdoor Science School, 5th and 6th grade students, their parents and teachers will participate in a workshop called ""What happens inside a leaf?"" To illustrate how cellular-level modifications can influence landscape processes, 3D-printed conifer needle models generated from X-ray imaging will be used. Anatomical models will be freely available through a website for teachers and students to 3D print hand-held models at schools, or as teaching kits for schools without access to 3D printing technology. <br/><br/>Conifers inhabit some of the driest and coldest habitats where trees are found.  Many conifer species are threatened by heat waves and droughts that induce physiological stress that can make them more vulnerable to pests and pathogens. Although most conifer leaves have only a single vein supplying water to the leaf, the internal anatomy outside the vein is incredibly diverse across the conifer phylogeny. The impact of this diversity on water transport and carbon uptake is unknown. The primary goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic framework to understand the influence of conifer leaf anatomy on leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic capacity. This mechanistic understanding will be used to illuminate how conifers have adapted to arid and cold environments and have also been able to successfully compete with angiosperm species over evolutionary history. The project will combine state-of the art 3-dimensional imaging methods (high-resolution X-ray computed micro-tomography) with a hydraulic model and measurement of leaf hydraulic conductance to clarify the impact of conifer leaf internal anatomy on hydraulic function."

Several proteins, many of which are present in all organisms, have evolved plant-specific structural features and functions to effectively address these challenges. One such group of proteins is the heterotrimeric G-protein family, which although present in all eukaryotes, has certain plant-specific components and features. This research seeks to discover the unique signaling pathways regulated by a novel, plant-specific G&gamma;  protein, AGG3, of Arabidopsis. Results obtained from this research will help us understand how plants maintain their yield against environmental stresses.

The type III G&gamma;  proteins are currently a focus of intense research due to their involvement in regulation of many agronomically important processes in plants, including seed yield, organ size regulation, abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling and stress responses, and nitrogen use efficiency. The mode of action of these proteins remains largely unknown, and some unique mechanisms that are independent of the classic G-protein cycle are also proposed. This research therefore aims to determine the G-protein-dependent and -independent roles of AGG3, and elucidate its underlying signaling mechanisms; especially those operative during abiotic stress signaling. Genetic complementation of single and higher order mutants will be performed using specific domains of AGG3, followed by identification of its protein interaction network. These analyses will help define the role of AGG3 and its network elements in abiotic stress signaling pathways and how it is related to its ability to control yield."

A strong driving force in speciation is adaptation to the local environment a population resides in, which can lead to splitting gene pools apart. If two populations of the same species living in distinct environments are adapted to their local ecological conditions, offspring between the two populations may not survive as well and ultimately reduce the exchange of genetic information between populations. It is the formation of this genetic isolation that can lead populations to become different species.  This study focuses on two populations of a cactus-breeding fly, Drosophila mojavensis, which live in different environments, use different cactus species, and have distinct larval behaviors. In one population the larvae feed on small cactus pads (prickly pear) and don't move much, while the other population feeds on larger cactus (organpipe) and move more and faster. Capitalizing on the rich genetic 'toolkit' for Drosophila this study will identify the genes responsible for these differences and determine how changes at the gene level can lead to different behaviors and population isolation. Information from this research will be shared with the science community through publications and presentations.  The investigator will mentor students through research in behavioral genetics and will use the funded techniques in research-focused college courses. Also the investigator will partner with local high schools to expose students to research at the university level.<br/><br/>Understanding the evolution and underlying genetics of alternative larval behaviors could be instrumental in elucidating how adaptation to local ecological conditions can lead to the divergence of populations, speciation, and how genotypes lead to behavioral phenotypes. Ecological adaptation has a significant influence on the variation seen in behavioral strategies. In saprophytic and phytophagous insects the properties of the plant host have been shown to greatly influence the pattern of genomic, metabolomics, physiological, life history and behavioral variation. It is this divergent, ecologically-driven adaptation to a host's properties that can drive the evolution of reproductive incompatibilities between host populations and lead to the formation of species. This study will focus on the variation of larval activity, and its underlying genetic control, of the cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis. Distinct populations of D. mojavensis have nutritionally and chemically distinct cactus hosts, which are associated with different larval behaviors. The study will examine the physiology and life history consequence of the distinct behaviors and link it to the transcriptional and genomic changes between the distinct cactus host populations of D. mojavensis. A quantitative trait loci analysis will examine the genetic underpinnings of larval behavior. CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts and transgenics will be generated to quantify the functional role of the candidate behavior QTLs in an ecological context and examine the life history consequences of variation at these loci and provide a strong examination of genotype to phenotype level questions."

Because no single species is a perfect model of human biology, science benefits from a broad portfolio of model organisms, each with its own relevance to human biology. This project will create new methods to study an emerging model, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This small fish offers an important advantage over traditional lab models. Since the glaciers retreated in the northern hemisphere ~12,000 years ago, many beneficial genetic variants have survived in thousands of distinct natural populations. Unlike laboratory genetic screens, which reveal mutations in genes causing abnormal development or physiology, these natural variants reveal biological innovations: new ways of resisting parasites, for instance. A large community of researchers (>100 labs) now studies stickleback to understand behavior, development, and immunology. The research team has identified candidate genes affecting important traits like brain and bone development, but require tools to experimentally alter gene function for confirmation. This grant will support a team of five researchers developing new gene-editing methods for stickleback. Because stickleback are easily studied in the wild as well, this research team can take the unique step of linking laboratory genetics back to gene function in their natural environment. The researchers will train undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from around the world, via new online communities and in-person courses. The project will also build infrastructure (a stock center) to perpetuate research-useful populations and provide research experiences for Native American students and communities, exposing them to scientific studies of local native animals.<br/><br/>Stickleback are a leading model in organismal biology for several reasons: 1. Marine populations independently colonized many diverse coastal watersheds, yielding exceptional phenotypic variation from a massively replicated natural experiment. 2. Ancestral alleles persist in modern oceanic populations, enabling genetic mapping of adaptive traits in known ecological contexts. 3. Stickleback are easy to breed and manipulate in large numbers in the lab and in nature. 4. Published genomes, transcriptomes, and microbiomes provide references for robust candidate gene identification and probe development. Consequently, hundreds of researchers study the genetics of stickleback adaptation. However, this research is largely confined to correlative approaches: QTL mapping, divergence mapping, and association studies. It remains rare for researchers to validate suspected candidate genes using experimental gene manipulation. To enable functional genomic studies of stickleback, this project will refine methods for gene editing. First, the research team will use transcriptomics and ChIP-Seq to improve genome annotation, to better locate candidate genes. Second, they will develop methods for more efficient gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 delivered via embryo microinjection or cell culture transfection, or using viral-mediated gene transfer. Finally, the team will construct a stock center where natural and transgenic lines can be maintained and shipped to users, enabling studies on standardized genetic backgrounds spanning sticklebacks? natural diversity. The work will be disseminated via webinars, methods blogs, cross training of students, and a large lab course. This will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and colleagues around the world, as well as Native American communities in Alaska."

The rise of atmospheric oxygen led to life as we know it today, including organisms that breath oxygen and multicellular life such as plants and animals. This event is principally related to the evolution of oxygen (O2) producing photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria. Photosystem II (PSII) is the catalyst that uses light energy to remove electrons from water and produce O2. The evolutionary route of PSII to produce O2 is uncertain. One hypothesis, based on both the geological record and biochemical studies of PSII, is a precursor photosystem was able to obtain electrons from the transition metal manganese, instead of water. The proposed work tests this hypothesis using modern Cyanobacteria and PSII, which may still be able to perform this reaction. The work will help scientists understand the evolution of this important process: the production of O2. It will also impact understanding of modern manganese cycling on our planet, which affects the fate of many pollutants in the environment. Students trained in this interdisciplinary research project from both a geobiology program at a research intensive university and a biological science program at a diverse regional Hispanic-serving primarily undergraduate institution will attend common group and professional meetings and develop mentor-mentee relationships across disciplines. Findings will also be integrated into presentations and coursework at K-12 and the two universities. <br/><br/><br/>This project concerns the hypothesis that the ""missing link"" in the evolution of photosynthetic water-oxidation by Photosystem II (PSII) was phototrophic Mn(II) oxidation, and examines Mn phototrophy in Cyanobacteria to test this hypothesis. High-valent manganese species comprise a critical pool of strong oxidants in the environment, involved in the cycling of both carbon and metals. This work will add to the understanding of modern biological Mn oxidation and the potential sources of high-valent Mn in nature by examining bacterial Mn oxidation in Mn phototrophy. Phototrophic Mn oxidation will be evaluated and linked to growth using whole cells of the genetically tractable Cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp.

These studies have the potential to provide new insight into our understanding of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

Understanding why animal signals are so complex and how they evolved is a major research focus for scientists in many fields. Such research can add to our knowledge about how the senses work, how attention and learning shift perception, and how changing environments can impact communication (among others). In this project, scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Auburn University use a systems approach to study the evolution of courtship displays in a well-developed animal system. The team uses genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of more than 23 species. For each species, they also describe the communication system in detail and how it changes with environmental conditions. They then test hypotheses about system properties such as robustness and flexibility/evolvability. The project will advance our understanding of complex animal signals, and test long-standing theories from engineering and genomics about system structure and function. The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students. Research findings will also be integrated into a science exhibit that will be made available to the general public at natural history museums in Nebraska and Alabama. <br/><br/>Despite an appreciation of the prevalence and importance of complex signals in animal communication, progress towards an evolutionary analysis of signal complexity has been constrained by a lack of hypotheses and tools that can compare signaling systems across taxa and assess evolutionary and functional implications. This project develops and tests a novel theoretical and empirical paradigm by integrating a systems approach into animal communication research using Schizocosa wolf spiders. North American Schizocosa include 23 species that vary in their use of vibratory and visual courtship displays. Specific aims are (1) to assess the structure and dynamics of vibratory and visual courtship signals of each species in different environments; (2) to generate a robust phylogeny; and (3) to use phylogenetic comparative methods to test (i) the hypothesis that degeneracy facilitates robustness across changing conditions and (ii) whether degeneracy facilitates (or constrains) elaboration and signal divergence. The simultaneous measures of vibratory and visual signals across contexts combined with a robust phylogeny will enable unparalleled opportunities for evolutionary analyses of complexity. This research will facilitate an integrative and comprehensive understanding of the evolution, diversification, and maintenance of complex animal communication and provide a roadmap for similar studies across distinct taxa and signaling systems."

In western Panama, where the species ranges of the tropical shorebirds known as Northern Jacanas and Wattled Jacanas meet, they form a hybrid zone. Jacanas exhibit mating role reversal where females control access to mates by competing for territories encompassing a harem of males, and males provide all parental care. The unusual circumstance of hybridization between species with such a unique mating system offers a window into examining why and how species-specific boundaries to mating fail, from a female perspective. Genetic and experimental evidence suggests that differences in aggressive behavior between the species may explain patterns of hybridization.  Females of the more aggressive species produce the majority of hybrid offspring. The proposed research employs techniques to assess the expression of genes to examine variation in aggressive behavior between the hybridizing species. This research addresses a fundamental question in ecology, evolution, and behavior what is the genetic basis of behavioral differences? This can 1) improve our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms important in species formation, and 2) provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying behavioral differences between males and females.  Understanding of science and research will be communicated through workshops with local school aged children and ecotourists at the Panamanian field site.<br/><br/>Between recently diverged species, mating behavior can either impede or promote reproductive isolation. Theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrates this for female mate choice and male competition, but little is known about the relative roles of each. Female aggression has only recently been recognized as an adaptive behavior, and how its underlying mechanisms compare to those of males is not well understood. A key step towards understanding the evolutionary significance of the competitive phenotype in females is determining its underlying genomic mechanisms. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the molecular basis of the female competitive phenotype by identifying clusters of candidate genes whose differential expression is responsible for consistent variation in aggressive behavior. This study combines aggression assays with a transcriptomic approach to address this question in role reversed, hybridizing Northern Jacanas (Jacana spinosa)and Wattled Jacanas (J. jacana) in Central America. This project is novel with respect to understanding the mechanisms by which phenotypes change as role reversed species diverge, which could advance our understanding of how organisms respond and adapt to changing environmental selection. By identifying how the genes underlying aggression are differentially expressed between role reversed females and males, the proposed research will expand upon general principles in sexual selection theory that have been developed in well-known male-dominant systems. Furthermore, this project investigates the genetic underpinnings of complex behavioral traits in wild, free-living, non-model organisms, which is vital for understanding the evolution of ecologically relevant phenotypes under natural conditions."

In some species, parents can even take the extreme step of eating their own young. Cannibalism of offspring has long fascinated scientists, but little is known about the environmental factors that provoke this behavior or the physiological changes that underlie the decision to care for or eat one's young. Answering these questions will provide insights into how and why adults terminate parental care in a broad range of species. This study will examine the switch from parental care to cannibalism in a fascinating study system, the eastern hellbender. These giant salamanders were once common in streams across the eastern U.S., but have experienced drastic population declines across much of their range in the last 30 years. Unlike many species, male hellbenders provide exclusive care for their young for an extended period (7 months). In some circumstances, however, male hellbenders cease providing care and consume all of their young. This study will employ underwater nest boxes in streams across a gradient of habitat characteristics to determine what hormones trigger this switch in behaviors and what environmental factors promote cannibalism. Not only will this advance knowledge of parental care, but the study will also employ high school science teachers in an integrated outreach effort to conserve of one of the largest and most fascinating amphibians in the world. <br/><br/><br/>Technical description<br/><br/>Parental care is a fundamental aspect of the life history of many animals. Paradoxically, in some invertebrates and vertebrates the parent(s) providing care engage in filial cannibalism, the consumption of one's own viable young. The adaptive basis for filial cannibalism remains an unresolved evolutionary conundrum, and the physiological basis for the behavior is unexplored in wild animals. In addition, few studies have considered the possibility that filial cannibalism may be maladaptive in some contexts or that there could be multiple drivers of filial cannibalism within a species. These critical knowledge gaps exist, at least in part, due to a scarcity of tractable wild animal models for simultaneously identifying environmental and physiological aspects of this life history decision. Hellbender salamanders exhibit paternal care as well as filial cannibalism and possess a suite of characteristics that make them an ideal system for addressing previously untested hypotheses related to the modulation of this fascinating life-history decision. Using a highly integrative framework that includes underwater nest boxes deployed in streams across a gradient of habitat quality and parasitism, coupled with genetic analyses and analysis of serum components collected from individuals throughout the paternal care season, this study will: 1) Identify the physiological modulators (i.e., hormones, serum components) that underlie the decision by a parent to either care for or cannibalize one's young, 2) Determine what key factors (i.e., per capita resources/body condition, multiple paternity, and parasites) influence this trade-off, and 3) Determine if habitat degradation increases the frequency of filial cannibalism.

This stress may be compounded by climate change, especially when the geographic range stretches over a large range of latitude. Many species use behavioral thermoregulation to ameliorate heat stress.  However, these compensatory behaviors have a cost, as they require the animal to abandon critical behaviors that may only be performed in the hot and stressful habitat. This study investigates these survival/reproductive tradeoffs in fiddler crabs, small semi-terrestrial crabs that occupy shorelines in the tropics and temperate zones. Male fiddler crabs use visual displays to attract mates in the hot, dry intertidal zone, but must periodically retreat to a cool, moist burrow to rehydrate and recover. Each retreat to a burrow requires a cessation of mating behavior. Periodically the males rereat from the hot reproductive areas to rehydrate and feed. This study will determine the tradeoff between thermoregulation and mating performance across a species' geographic range, using both experimental and modeling approaches, under both current and predicted future conditions. Finally, the project will utilize the results of the research on fiddler crabs to increase public interest in science using public outreach activities and the training students at different levels including high school students. <br/><br/>Behavioral compensation for thermal stress can lead to a profound but under-investigated tradeoff, as thermoregulatory behaviors are costly. Energetic and thermoregulation costs will generate major reproductive opportunity costs, which can reduce mating success. This project focuses on the fitness consequences of missed mating opportunities associated with thermoregulatory behaviors. These missed opportunities are crucial to understand in the study of mating success in the context of physiological stress and the differences in costs at different latitudes. Understanding the associated reductions in fitness are crucial to fully understand and predict the consequences of climate change on fitness, since heating in lower latitudes may truncate the benefit of mating owing to the increased cost of thermal stress. This proposal takes an integrative approach, combining laboratory measurements, manipulative field experiments, and biophysical modeling to examine the fitness consequences of behavioral thermoregulation. This work, and the resulting model, will be broadly applicable to the study of climate change impacts on ectotherms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results of this research will enable better predictions of the types of plankton that are and are not filtered efficiently, provide insight into the factors that influence particle capture, help define the food resources of bottom-dwelling filter feeders in different environments, and strengthen existing models regarding competition between different species of filter feeders and their influence on the community structure of plankton in near-shore ecosystems.  The project will involve high-school, undergraduate and graduate students, and will develop educational packages for home-school and marine-science educators. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the plasticity of particle capture in two groups of invertebrate suspension-feeders (bivalves, tunicates) and determine if the process can be mediated by intrinsic (behavioral, physiological) or extrinsic (particle properties) factors. The work focuses on feeding because of the primacy of this process in determining fitness. Specifically, researchers will determine if particle capture responds to changes in the number and types of planktonic cells available (i.e., plasticity), or if capture is a consequence of the physicochemical properties of the cells (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, wettability). They will employ their previously developed methods and innovative approaches to study suspension feeding using a combination of in situ techniques, controlled dock-side experiments, in vivo laboratory assays, flow cytometry, and DNA barcoding by means of Illumina sequencing. The combined application of these methods will allow researchers to examine, with unprecedented accuracy and resolution, the full range of planktonic cells that suspension-feeders capture, and address fundamental questions regarding physiological control of particle capture (or lack thereof) under different particle spectra and, thus, changing food supplies.  In the process, they will re-examine the paradigm that biological filtration of plankton is mostly controlled by particle size.  Results of the study will enable better predictions of the types of plankton that are and are not captured efficiently, provide insight into the factors influencing mechanisms of particle capture, help define the food resources of mesotrophic and oligotrophic suspension-feeders, and strengthen existing models regarding interspecific competition and impacts of suspension-feeders on microbial community structure of the seston.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Less well-understood is the observation that visibly conserved traits in different species are sometimes specified by divergent gene regulatory mechanisms.  The goal of the work proposed here is to understand how changes in gene expression influence traits in different species.  Results from this study will not only impact our understanding of the evolution of developmental mechanisms, but also our understanding of the discovery of broader evolutionary trends.  Dr. Ruvinsky will incorporate findings of this work into his teaching of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago as well as to science teachers of Chicago Public Schools.  Research in Dr. Ruvinsky?s laboratory will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will be trained in experimental and computational approaches central to this proposal.  The PI and other members of the laboratory will present their findings at a variety of scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The Ruvinsky Laboratory at the University of Chicago has established the gene unc-47 in Caenorhabditis nematodes as a model system for the study of gene regulatory evolution. Despite an apparently conserved expression pattern among these nematode species, the mechanisms that control unc-47 have diverged. The PI proposes three aims.  First, Dr. Ruvinsky will dissect in detail the divergence of cis-regulation of the unc-47 gene in Caenorhabditis.  Combining comparative and functional approaches, this work will provide a detailed picture of changes, possibly at the single-nucleotide resolution, that led to the divergence of regulatory mechanisms, while preserving the expression pattern.  Second, using both standard and state-of-the-art molecular genetic methods, Dr. Ruvinsky will identify compensatory mutations in trans(cription) factors that permitted cis-regulatory divergence of unc-47 without changes to the expression pattern of the gene.  Finally, Dr. Ruvinsky will determine the generality of the principles of regulatory divergence inferred from the unc-47 locus. Several genes have been identified that retain conserved expression in different species, while being regulated in subtly different ways. The goal of this aim is to test whether the rules governing changes in unc-47 regulation apply to other genes.  Together these experiments promise to provide a highly detailed mechanistic view of gene regulatory evolution and thus contribute to the study of Evo-Devo."

Starvation-resistant flies have survived many generations of laboratory-controlled starvation conditions, and are substantially larger than control flies, which were continuously supplied with food. The starvation-selected flies carry much more stored fat, in expanded fat tissues.  In most insects, a larger female lays more eggs and therefore has more surviving offspring than a smaller female.  This is not the case when large females from the starvation-resistant populations are compared to the smaller females from the control populations.  This unexpected situation provides an excellent opportunity to look carefully at the tradeoffs between survival and reproduction, a central theme to the understanding of life cycles for many different species, and how they change during evolution. Because Drosophila melanogaster is a very well studied model organism, this project will use techniques of molecular genetics and cell biology to understand the underlying physiology and genetic changes that have occurred during starvation selection.  The experimental toolkit available for Drosophila will be used to test the function of specific candidate genes in ovarian development and fat body function.  This project will provide a unique learning environment for graduate students and undergraduates at a minority serving institution, by their participation in an integrated series of scientific activities that link evolutionary biology to developmental biology through an organismal perspective.  Outreach activities will include production of videos displayed in the lobby of a highly-trafficked research building on the UNLV campus, participation in the NSF Radio 360 program, and development of a Science Café for the general public.

Such differences may result from differential biological fitness associated with individual variation in cognitive abilities, yet empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Different tasks require different cognitive abilities (e.g. spatial memory vs. memory for color), yet whether natural selection can shape different cognitive abilities independently is also debated. <br/><br/>The proposed research will address these two major questions by (1) comparing individual differences in two cognitive abilities (spatial learning and non-spatial learning in wild food-caching mountain chickadees in two environments that place different demands on just one of these abilities, spatial memory, which is involved in recovering thousands of previously made food caches and (2) measuring biological fitness associated with individual differences in both cognitive abilities. If natural selection can affect these abilities independently, only differences in spatial learning ability should be associated with differential biological fitness. <br/><br/>In addition to addressing major evolutionary questions about population/species differences in cognitive abilities, the proposed study will also have significant implications for learning and memory research. It is still generally assumed that the mechanisms underlying associative learning in general are the same for all types of learning and memory and so studying one type of memory allows development of treatments for all memory types. Demonstrating that natural selection can affect different cognitive abilities independently would suggest that we must consider specific cognitive abilities and their regulatory mechanisms individually when designing interventions. The proposed research will also increase research readiness and science literacy by providing intensive research training to undergraduate and graduate students as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public through the Sagehen Biological Station."

The importance of growth regulation to human health makes studies of polyphenic organ size potentially transformative. How is one form specified and realized in each individual? How does this ability evolve in the species where it occurs? How can alternate wing sizes affect the spread of insects into new habitats? This project seeks to understand the cues and alternative developmental processes that result in differently sized and patterned wings of a native Florida insect, the red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma). This project will use high-throughput sequencing to compare the expression of genes in bugs of each wing pattern. For selected genes, functional tests will examine their interactions and roles in regulating organ size and wing pattern. The evolution of polyphenism will be explored by laboratory selection on wing size variation in soapberry bugs and in a related insect, the large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), which normally grows to a consistent adult wing size and pattern. This work will be conducted largely by undergraduate students, as part of an integrative curriculum that combines hands-on work in molecular genetics, evolutionary biology and ecology with related social science and humanities courses related to urban life and adaptation to new environments. Public K-12 students and teachers will assist in field surveys of the bugs to determine how wing sizes correlate with their northward expansion from Florida up the East Coast.

A better understanding of the regulation of mitochondrial components is needed to explain plant energy balance and biomass accumulation.  Because respiratory activity is part of the equation determining plant productivity, understanding the control of plant respiration may enable targeted manipulation of respiration to enhance productivity, particularly under stress conditions.<br/> <br/>Experiments will be performed to define the function of a class of proteins predicted to regulate plant mitochondrial gene expression known as mTERFs, for mitochondrial Transcription Termination Factors, using a combination of state-of-the-art biochemistry and genetics in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

Experiments will define the molecular mechanism of SHOT1 function, and go on to test how other mTERFs may also contribute to control of respiration and plant stress tolerance.  The project will provide training in experimentation and communication for one postdoctoral scientist, one graduate student and two undergraduates for each year of the award.

However, insect herbivores are capable of degrading these compounds and using the simpler compounds derived from the degradation processes for energy. While early work assumed that the source of the catalyst enzymes involved in the biochemical breakdown of lignocellulosic compounds (i.e., plant cell wall degradation enzymes, PCWDE) in insects was gut-resident symbiotic bacteria, recent work has shown that PCWDE produced by the cells of the insect gut are more important than previously realized. The goal of this research is to examine the diversity of PCWDE in two major lower insect lineages using a combination of functional genomics and biochemical tests. This basic research will improve understanding about the physiological mechanisms of insect digestion and may yield novel insights about insect control methods, biofuel industry improvements, and other industrial applications. This work will provide the opportunity for undergraduate, high school and graduate students to gain experience in cutting edge functional genomics, and insect physiology and biochemistry. Museum exhibits will be produced to educate the public about the importance of wood feeding insects. These exhibits will be presented at the University of California David Bohart Museum of Entomology and several other science museums across California and Tennessee. <br/><br/>Preliminary work revealed that Phasmids (walking sticks) and Thysanurans (silverfish and firebrats) have strikingly high numbers of PCWDE, that these genes show compartment specific expression within the gut, and are effective at degrading plant cell wall compounds. This project will identify the full complement of PCWDE present in the focal species (6 Phasmids and 3 Thysanurans) and compare the activity and expression levels of them in the digestive systems of these insects. Using heterologous expression, the researchers will characterize the activity of the most active enzymes in these systems. The researchers will also analyze how patterns of gene expression correlate with the physical attributes of the gut, which vary greatly between the two focal insect orders. The ultimate goal is to describe the variation in physiological compartmentalization of the digestive system and determine how it works synergistically with a diversity of differentially-expressed enzymes to maximize digestion of lignocellulosic compounds.

Indeed, although the negative effects of stress on reproduction are well appreciated, the specific signaling factors and neural mechanisms that converge in the brain to inhibit reproduction under stressful conditions remain poorly defined. This proposal will use novel mouse models and neural gene profiling to test how psychosocial stress alters inhibitory neural circuits in the brain in relation to controlling fertility. This proposal will substantially expand our knowledge of how stressors ""communicate"" with specific parts of the brain that control reproduction. This information will significantly advance the field of reproductive neuroendocrinology. Moreover, given the common theme of stress inhibition on reproduction in many animals, this research will ultimately have broad impact for better understanding brain and hormone functioning of multiple vertebrate species. The research component is complemented and integrated with a comprehensive broader impact plan which includes training and mentoring undergraduate students and post-doctoral scholars, including women and under-represented minorities. The proposal also includes a program aimed at engaging under-represented minority high school students in science research, as well as a new brain research outreach program and internship collaboration with a local high school with students from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.<br/><br/>Stress can inhibit fertility and reproductive status, but exactly how this occurs mechanistically is poorly understood. Reproduction is simulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the brain. The highly-conserved neuropeptide RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3), encoded by the Rfrp gene, negatively regulates the reproductive axis by inhibiting GnRH secretion. However, very little is known about the phenotype, regulation, or functional necessity of RFRP-3 neurons. As an inhibitor of GnRH, RFRP-3 is poised to relay inhibitory stress signals to the reproductive axis, but this requires testing. This proposal will utilize new transgenic RFRP-3 mouse models (the first of their kind), coupled with cutting-edge molecular tools, to functionally test the involvement and necessity of RFRP-3 neurons in mediating the negative effects of stress on reproductive status, as well as identify novel brain genes that are activated under stressful and non-stressful conditions. This study will therefore provide fresh insight into the physiological regulation and functional roles of RFRP-3 neurons and other brain circuitry in the modulation of reproductive status during stress, and will empirically probe RFRP-3 regulation and function in new ways that have not been possible with former histological and pharmacological methods."

Fungi in the Phylum Ascomycota, a group that includes numerous important plant and animal pathogens, provide model systems for these studies as they are easily manipulated, develop fruiting structures with a few well-characterized tissue types on common media, and have genomic resources that enable comparative and functional analyses. The proposed research will use comparative transcriptional profiling and functional characterization coupled with phenotypic analyses to reveal developmental mechanisms underlying several key morphologies of fungal fruiting bodies, and to reveal the evolutionary processes by which these morphological innovations arose and diverged across a set of fungi. The research will reveal the genetic basis of a greater scope of morphological features of functional importance, associated with niche adaptation, for fungal fruiting bodies in the expanded six genera, and identify the roles and interactions of transcription factors in the evolution of the fruiting body development in two model species, F. graminearum and N. crassa. As the first systems biological analysis of developmental divergence in fungi, this research will provide an insightful comparison to well-known examples of developmental systems in microbes, plants, and animals. By studying these diverse multicellular systems, we gain a better understanding of the constraints and potentialities that shape developmental biology."

The process of decision making involves two key components: assessing the value of a sensory stimulus or anticipated outcome, and taking action based on that evaluation.  In humans and other mammals, neural networks involving the association cortex and reward centers have been implicated in stimulus evaluation, while other networks have been implicated in motor planning and initiation.  What remains unknown is the circuit through which evaluation directs selective motor activation.  Defining this link is essential to understand decision making, and this project will investigate natural social behaviors in a new animal model of decision making to reveal how the nervous system forges that link between perception and action.  An improved understanding of decision making and social behavior will advance many fields including neuroscience, psychology, and economics.  Furthermore, this research will also guide understanding of how decision making can go awry, yielding the promise of mechanistically-targeted treatments for behavioral pathologies such as compulsive behavior and addictive relapse.  Such advances will vastly improve not only quality of life but also national economic competitiveness.

In these experiments, the researchers will (Aim 1) identify how subjective value of male song is encoded in specific populations of neurons in the female brain.  Additional experiments will (Aim 2) identify circuits through which sensory processing of subjective value directs motor behavior.  In those experiments, focally applied, low-intensity light will be used to activate or inactivate those circuits to discern the causal relation between activity in those pathways and performance of specific behavioral responses.

Taking advantage of the available genetic tools in this organism, the large international community of C. elegans biologists, has made great strides in explaining the cellular and developmental mechanisms that govern how all animals function. For instance, it is now known that the same cell communication pathways control the development of diverse species, including C. elegans, and mammals like mice and humans.  This collaborative project investigates the role of one of these conserved pathways in C. elegans development, focusing on asymmetric stem cell divisions. It will extend these studies to the most well-established mammalian example of a stem cell population, intestinal stem cells. In this way, it will determine the extent to which existing models of control of C. elegans stem cell divisions are conserved in mammals. Thus the research will provide a strong framework to address common problems that stem cells in these distantly-related animals encounter. The project will broaden the impact of these studies by 1) increasing public engagement and science literacy through hands-on workshops geared toward the general public, 2) recruiting the next generation of STEM scientists by bringing 8th graders from rural Iowa communities with large Hispanic populations to campus for a day of career simulations and 3) retaining current STEM undergraduates by extending undergraduate research opportunities, including to disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. <br/><br/><br/>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) drives cell fate specification in animals from mammals to nematodes. Stem cells in these organisms use ACD to generate a differentiated daughter and a new stem cell. Wnt signaling is a conserved regulator of ACD and cell fate through its control of the transcriptional activator beta-catenin. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of beta-catenin regulation during asymmetric stem cell divisions by analyzing regulation of the C. elegans beta-catenin, SYS-1, and to begin testing the resulting mechanisms in mammals. C. elegans is well-suited for these analyses because of its genetic and molecular tools, in vivo ACD imaging, the separation of the signaling and adhesion functions of beta-catenin into distinct genes and because of recent findings that SYS-1 is negatively regulated by homologs of the beta-catenin destruction complex: Axin, APC and CK1alpha. The mammalian intestinal crypt, arguably the best-known example of Wnt-controlled stem cell maintenance, will be used to test conservation of SYS 1 regulatory mechanisms and will also inform the worm models. This project will determine the mechanism by which Axin localizes the destruction complex, and the extent to which destruction complex regulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus is conserved. The results of these studies are predicted to provide broadly important insight into developmental cell fate specification and the role of Wnt pathway-induced ACD in tissue homeostasis."

This bacterium is maternally transmitted and is known to cause a variety of effects in the insect host including manipulation of reproduction and suppression of virus replication.  Because Wolbachia is capable of suppressing virus replication in insect hosts, it is being used to decrease the spread of human diseases (so-called ""pathogen blocking""). It is critical, therefore, to better understand how Wolbachia infects hosts and alters host cell biology.  Although Wolbachia infect upwards of 40% of insects on the planet, there is surprisingly little known about the exact mechanism used by the bacterium to manipulate its host.  This is largely due to the fact that Wolbachia occurs inside host cells and cannot be genetically manipulated presently.  This project will use a novel approach in this system to identify proteins used by the bacterium to alter host cell biology.  By identifying and characterizing these proteins, much will be learned about the basic biology of Wolbachia and the host cell components utilized during infection. Results will also lead to comparative analyses in other symbiotic systems. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science will be trained with project-based research related to this project on Wolbachia.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which an extraordinarily widespread bacterium interacts with its host.  Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alpha-proteobacterium that forms symbioses with an extremely broad array of invertebrates, including isopods, nematodes, and insects.  Wolbachia is currently of interest with regards to vector control because mosquitoes harboring the bacterium are unable to transmit important human diseases. Because Wolbachia are not currently culturable or genetically tractable, little is known about the molecular basis of interaction with eukaryotic hosts.  Wolbachia encodes a type IV secretion system and is thought to secrete proteins (termed ""effectors"") into the eukaryotic cell to alter the biology of its insect hosts.  This project will use a powerful method to identify and study the biochemical function of probable effectors in Wolbachia.  The investigators will identify candidate effectors through genomics and  bioinformatics.  They will use a yeast genetic screen and a secretion assay in a heterologous system to further identify and characterize these candidates.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the biochemical function and cellular effects of these proteins in the Drosophila host.  These results will be the first comprehensive analysis of Wolbachia secreted substrates and will lead to significant advances in the Wolbachia field and comparative work in other symbiotic strains (such as those infecting filarial nemotodes)."

The research team from the University of Puerto Rico, George Washington University, and Cornell University will investigate the gene changes underlying distribution of pigmentation across the wing surface among a variety of butterfly species.

This work will address how the modulation of WntA spatial expression has tinkered with the micro- and macroevolution of distinct wing phenotypes across 65 million years. We will specifically aim to address the following questions: (1) How many regulatory elements at a single gene control wing pattern variation, and what are the function of individual elements? (2) Do the same elements also control the convergent evolution of mimetic phenotypes in unrelated species? (3) To what extent are wing pattern CREs conserved versus novel across species with highly divergent wing patterns? Answering these questions will help set a precedent for understanding deeper phylogenetic patterns in the relationship between the evolution of CREs and the traits they define.

Understanding how novelty arises is thus a key question in evolutionary biology.  One approach to understanding how novelty arises is to compare development in species with the novel structure and their close relatives lacking it.  In arthropods, outgrowths of the body wall have served as a repeated source of novel structures, including insect wings.  This research takes a comparative approach to determine how a novel body wall outgrowth, the ""helmet"" of a group of true bugs called treehoppers, arose.  This structure allows treehoppers to take on a wide diversity of shapes that may increase survival, for example by mimicking another organism or through camouflage.  This project will enhance scientific training by providing research experience to undergraduates, including those recruited from programs designed to enhance the participation of groups underrepresented in science.  It will also provide training to a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher.  Treehoppers will also be used as a tool for public outreach about insect diversity.  <br/><br/>The highly evolvable prothoracic helmet of treehoppers (family Membracidae and close relatives) is a three-dimensional sculpture that is hypothesized to have evolved by one of three processes: elaboration of the ancestral body wall developmental patterning network, cooption of the wing patterning network or cooption of the leg patterning network.  These hypotheses make specific predictions about patterns of similarity and difference in gene expression and function across tissue types and species.  This project combines comparative transcriptomics with the analysis of gene function in an evolutionary context to test these predictions.  This work will also test hypotheses related to the occurrence of molecularly-defined wing serial homologues in the wingless prothoracic segment.  These project goals will be accomplished by (1) comparing tissue- and stage-specific transcriptomes of two treehoppers, including a newly developed developmental model Entylia carinata, and two helmet-less relatives; (2) using homeotic transformations between the prothorax and mesothorax to identify serially homologous parts of the pronotal helmet and mesothorax; (3) using reverse genetics and qPCR to analyze functions of developmental patterning genes involved in helmet development in both the treehopper E. carinata and an outgroup hemipteran, Oncopeltus fasciatus."

These preserve pools of cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, that enable rapid bone growth. Much is known regarding the genes and developmental processes that control chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. Yet, how growth plates are induced and why they occur at specific locations in the skeleton continues to be a mystery. For example, metatarsal bones in the feet produce a growth plate at only one end, and the pisiform and calcaneus are the only wrist and ankle bones to form a growth plate. By comparing these growth plates to the matched skeletal sites that fail to form them, these bones form ideal models to isolate the patterns of gene expression and regulation that control how and where growth plates are formed. The pisiform growth plate is particularly susceptible to the perturbation of key developmental genes that further allows the role of these genes in growth plate formation to be identified. This program expands laboratory research opportunities for a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in the application of cutting-edge methods in developmental biology and comparative genomics to fundamental questions related to human development and growth. This research project supports collaboration between scientists, students, and the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to develop outreach efforts to underserved populations lacking in such opportunities. A science workshop for gifted but underserved Philadelphia high school students will provide classroom and research experiences related to mammalian developmental biology and gene regulation.<br/><br/>This research will employ a novel approach comparing otherwise equivalent regions of the endochondral skeleton that do and do not form growth plates. Through whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) and chromatin-state (ATAC-seq) sequencing of paired growth plate forming and non-forming tissues, the pisiform, calcaneus, and metatarsal will identify inductive factors of growth plate formation. It is hypothesized that expression differences exist in chondrocyte populations prior to the visible formation of growth plates and that these factors will also be differentially associated with reserve zone and perichondrial cells. In addition, Hox genes have a role in growth plate patterning, and it is believed that the nodular nature of most carpals and tarsals results from the more limited role for Hox genes in their development. However, Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 loss-of-function result in malformation of the proximal carpus and tarsus, including shortened pisiforms. Thus, the pisiform and calcaneus are natural test cases to determine the role that later stage Hox11 expression plays in growth plate formation. It is predicted that Hox11 has a direct role in pisiform and calcaneus growth plate induction by establishing reserve zone and perichondrial chondrocyte populations. Furthermore, it is predicted that growth plate forming sites will be biased for active enhancers containing Hox11-13 response elements and that enhancer activity patterns will be shared among different growth plates."

Neuroscience research seeks to understand such interactions. However, in many cases, progress has been slow because the parts list is too long and the parts themselves are too complex. This project takes advantage of an unusual animal--a fish that emits its own electrical field, in which the individual brain structures are sufficiently simple and well-studied that their interactions can be understood in great detail. Specific goals of this project are to define the function of feedback or ""backward"" connections from higher to lower stages of sensory processing as well as the function of connections between the cerebellum and sensory processing regions. Feedback and cerebellar connections are believed to be critical for sensory processing in humans and have been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism, but our knowledge is sketchy and insufficient or designing treatments. By providing detailed information about such interactions in a simpler system, this project will serve as a foundation for understanding interactions in more complex systems such as the human brain. The investigator will use the resources developed from this project's research activities to improve science literacy and education regionally, nationally, and internationally. <br/><br/>By virtue of their tractable electrosensory and electromotor systems mormyrid fish have proven to be a valuable model system for linking structure and function in neural circuits. Studies of the first processing stage for the electrosense in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) have produced a fairly complete and well-tested model in which an experimentally measured form of spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity acts on well-described motor corollary discharge responses to predict and cancel out self-generated sensory inputs. Anatomical studies have mapped central electrosensory pathways and behavioral studies have documented sophisticated electrolocation abilities that likely depend on higher-level neural processing. However physiological studies of higher stages of electrosensory processing are needed to link structure and function. The goal of this project is to provide the first in depth characterization of the midbrain lateral toral nucleus (NL)--the next major processing stage after ELL. The investigators' approach will include intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology in awake preparations, simultaneous behavioral measurements, and circuit manipulations.  Proposed experiments will test specific hypotheses regarding NL function while at the same time addressing a number of general issues in neuroscience including multimodal integration, functions of recurrent feedback, and roles of the cerebellum in sensory processing."

The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that facilitate Wolbachia maternal transmission. This will include creating a mathematical model of fruit fly egg-cell colonization by Wolbachia, and using the model to test predictions about the factors governing Wolbachia density within developing eggs.  Modeling intracellular endosymbiont dynamics is virtually unprecedented, thus this work will provide new insights as well as a valuable analytical tool.  In addition, the nutritional signals that regulate host transport and thus Wolbachia distribution within fruit fly eggs will be elucidated.  As cellular transport processes are also crucial for establishing the insect body plan, these analyses will inform Wolbachia transmission and insect development as an integrated process.  This will link concepts that have been regarded as mechanistically separate.  The research will be performed at a majority-minority, Hispanic-serving institution and the nation's largest producer of STEM minority undergraduate degrees.  Trainees carrying out this project will also create essays that explain research practices and benefits.

This maternally transmitted bacterium has a streamlined genome and a facultative intracellular lifestyle.  The high prevalence of Wolbachia in insect populations requires robust transmission-enhancing strategies.  The overall goal of this project is to apply chemical, genetic and nutritional approaches to define the impacts of host diet and nutrient-responsive signaling on Wolbachia and germline determinant localization in oogenesis.  The first aim involves defining how Wolbachia colonize Drosophila maternal germline cells as an integrated physiological process.  Though Wolbachia titer in developing oocytes is responsive to host manipulation, the relative contributions of host and symbiont to titer regulation is unknown.  To address this issue, Wolbachia life cycle and invasion dynamics, as well as host germline development rates will be assessed cytologically and used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model.  The model will be the first to test for conservation of Wolbachia colonization mechanisms across host-strain combinations, as well as in response to nutrient-sensitive signaling cues.  The second aim is to elucidate how strategic Wolbachia localization is regulated during oogenesis.  In D. melanogaster, microtubule-based motor proteins concentrate Wolbachia and posterior/germline determinants at the oocyte posterior cortex, thus pre-positioning Wolbachia at the germ cell formation site.   The impact of nutritional signaling on this process will be studied using genetic approaches. Taken together, this work will comprehensively inform the cellular basis for transmission of this endosymbiont."

The signal mechanisms identified through this work should function similarly in the development of animals generally.  Thus, this project will advance our knowledge of fundamental biological mechanisms; in particular, the biophysical factors that govern development, including pattern formation, joint movements of cells, and regulation of cell-cell signals.

She will train undergraduate and graduate students in critical thinking and interdisciplinary research methods, expand participation of underrepresented individuals in science by partnering with existing programs, and engage in community outreach efforts. <br/><br/>Technical paragraph:<br/>To determine how tissue structure influences morphogenesis, the research team specifically investigates the Drosophila ovary.  Studying Drosophila has proven to be a powerful strategy to discover new genes and signaling mechanisms that function in many organisms, including humans. In the ovary, the epithelial-derived border cells become motile upon activation of the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway. During oogenesis, a diffusible activator is released from two follicle cells and functions to turn on STAT signaling in a dose-dependent fashion in nearby cells.  Activated cells migrate collectively toward high levels of secreted chemoattractants. Prior work suggests that these signaling events are regulated by conserved mechanisms. The project takes advantage of Drosophila genetics, mathematical modeling, and the relatively simple architecture of the developing egg, which can be imaged live to observe cell types interacting in vivo. Specifically, the researchers will: 1) investigate how the dynamics of a diffusible secreted signal are regulated, and how gaps within tissue architecture shape its signal transduction gradient and resultant cell specification, and 2) determine how the landscape of cells in the microenvironment through which the border cells migrate affects collective cell migration behaviors and local concentrations of secreted guidance cues.  Overall, this project will integrate cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research with outstanding educational opportunities for the next generation of potential scientists."

Scientists know a great deal about how TTX normally blocks neural activity, but not much about how animals that possess TTX are able to resist its effects. The ability of newts to resist TTX is particularly puzzling because several of their genes must be mutated in concert, as a mutation in only one affected gene would leave the newt vulnerable to TTX's affects, and likely dead. Strangely, newts are not simply resistant to TTX's effects, but are actually attracted to the smell of TTX. In the proposed work, the team will use well-established methods to quantify the distribution of TTX inside newts' bodies, identify mutations that are likely involved in TTX resistance, examine the effects of TTX on their neurons, and discover how the neurons involved in smelling are activated by TTX. This basic research will help scientists understand how neurons work at a molecular level, which will increase or understanding of the ""nuts and bolts"" of healthy brain function, as well as how animals adapt to the presence of toxins.

This is due to Vibrio's ability to cope with changes in water temperature and salinity. It is known that Vibrio are able to respond to different salt levels by altering the level of compatible solutes within the cell. They do this by synthesizing or transporting these solutes into the cell. But, the genetic and molecular basis for how they regulate these processes is unknown. This research tests the hypothesis that regulators which control gene expression in response to quorum sensing, are also involved in responses to changes in salt levels and temperature. Previously, quorum sensing regulators were thought to regulate gene expression only in response to the density of bacterial populations. The idea that quorum sensing regulators are involved in responding to changes in the environment is thus novel and exciting. Graduate students and undergraduates, including representatives recruited from under-represented groups in science, will be trained in molecular genetic techniques as part of this research. In particular, students in an upper level undergraduate class will identify genes involved in salt tolerance. Vibrio species play important roles in the carbon and nutrient cycles in marine and estuarine environments. Many Vibrio species are also serious pathogens of humans and marine animals. Therefore, understanding how bacteria, such as Vibrio, adapt to changes in the environment is critical to understanding their spread and potential impacts on human health and critical marine and estuarine ecosystems.<br/><br/>Halophilic Vibrio species have the unusual ability to synthesize both ectoine (from aspartate) and glycine betaine (from choline) and contain multiple transporters for their transport into the cell. Quorum sensing is a mechanism of communication that bacteria employ using autoinducer signals to monitor and respond to changes in population density. Quorum sensing regulators control the expression of 100s of genes. Bioinformatics analysis identified quorum sensing master regulators OpaR and AphA binding sites in the regulatory region of ectoine and glycine betaine biosynthesis and transporter genes. One model for quorum sensing regulation of compatible solute biosynthesis and transport, is that, in order for halophiles to grow at to high population densities, they require high NaCl concentrations, which necessitates the accumulation of compatible solutes. OpaR, which is produced maximally at high population densities, regulates the biosynthesis and transport of compatible allowing cells to grow optimally. In the proposed work, bioinformatics, molecular genetics and biochemical approaches will be used to demonstrate that OpaR (LuxR homologue) and AphA can control the osmotic stress response in halophiles. We will determine the role of these regulators in the low salinity response by analyzing the salinity response transcriptome using RNA-seq. We will develop a course in experimental biology utilizing global insertional mutagenesis to uncover novel targets required for the salinity stress response. This will introduce more undergraduate students to scientific discovery, provide them with opportunities to develop technical skills, and ultimately make them more competitive and career ready."

However, coral bleaching, a process in which corals expel these algal symbionts in response to environmental stress, has been occurring at increasing rates over the past few decades.   Bleaching is especially widespread during times of high water temperature, and often leads to the death of the coral and damage to the reef.  Indeed, there is concern that much of the coral reef habitat will be lost in the next fifty years due to the impacts of ocean warming and coral bleaching.  This project aims to increase biologists' understanding of why bleaching occurs, by comparing the temperature sensitivity of important enzymes in corals to those of different types of Symbiodinium.  The researchers hypothesize that one reason bleaching occurs is because corals are adapted to live at higher temperatures than the algae (which live not only within coral tissue but also free in the water), and furthermore that different types of algae may be more or less adapted to withstand high temperature.  The research will provide opportunities for teaching and training undergraduates interested in careers in science, as well as in-depth summer opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged high school students.  The results of the study will help researchers better predict the likely extent of future bleaching events, and the possibility that corals and algae may be able to adapt to withstand increasing water temperatures.<br/><br/>This project will test two specific hypotheses: First, that there is a mismatch in adaptation temperature between the partners, leading to a loss of metabolic function in Symbiodinium at higher temperatures. The hypothesis is based on the observation that Symbiodinium occur in the coral host, but also are free-living in environments across a broad, and often cooler, temperature range. At the biochemical level, adaptation to a eurythermal environment requires enzymes to maintain catalytic rate and substrate affinity over a wide temperature range, but might concomitantly reduce structural stability. To test this hypothesis, metabolic enzymes occurring both in corals and Symbiodinium will be expressed recombinantly, and temperature sensitivity of kinetic parameters of enzyme function will be assessed. Thermal stability of each enzyme also will be measured through residual activity and circular dichroism spectrometry. A second hypothesis is that Symbiodinium types differing in thermal tolerance are biochemically adapted to different temperatures. It has been shown that different clades of Symbiodinium have varying thermal sensitivities, providing the holobiont different levels of resistance to heat-induced bleaching. The hypothesis will be tested by examining representative enzymes from different Symbiodinium types using the approaches described above. In addition, because Symbiodinium orthologs are structurally similar, 3D models of target enzymes will be examined to determine the extent, location, and types of amino acid substitutions that lead to changes in thermal sensitivity; the temperature-adaptive importance of these substitutions will be confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis followed by expression, enzyme kinetics and stability analyses."

Such dramatic reductions in muscle and organ mass could result in significant functional losses of organ systems but this has not been thoroughly investigated. This project proposes to investigate the causes, consequences, and mechanisms of protein breakdown during flight in migratory birds. This research will further our insight into the unique metabolism of migratory birds in flight, deepen our understanding of how migratory birds maintain homeostasis despite dramatic reductions in critical organ systems, and will provide novel insight into the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in muscle and organ degeneration and regeneration. Additionally, this project will provide a platform to engage many undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds in integrative research, providing exposure and training in a broad range of cutting edge techniques that will be applicable to many STEM fields. These students will also develop and implement science communication and outreach programming for middle school students in a local low-income school district.<br/><br/>During flight, metabolic rate is 10-fold higher than at rest and rates of water loss are very high, placing extreme demands on the ability of birds to manage water and energy budgets. Migratory birds fuel long-duration flight primarily by the oxidation of fat, but a large amount of protein is also catabolized, resulting in reductions in muscle and organ mass of 20% - 40% from pre-flight levels. However, the functional limits and underlying mechanisms of lean mass catabolism during flight remain unclear. Migratory birds will be flown in a climatically controlled wind tunnel for extended periods to evaluate hypotheses for the causes of protein catabolism, while the consequences and mechanisms of protein catabolism will be assessed by measuring whole animal and tissue level changes in key physiological processes, and by investigating transcriptional differences that occur during flight. This will provide insight into physiological mechanisms that allow the maintenance of homeostasis despite dramatic organ and muscle remodeling, and will further our understanding of the basic mechanisms controlling phenotypic flexibility in vertebrates.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive integrative training in many cutting-edge techniques as part of this project, which will be broadly applicable to many STEM careers. This research will provide genuine research experiences for many undergraduates with emphasis on providing mentorship and training to encourage women and students from underrepresented groups to further pursue careers in STEM disciplines."

This type of social system, called cooperative breeding, is frequently associated with monogamy across a diversity of animal groups. This association is thought to result from the fact that helpers in monogamous groups share on average 50% of their genes with their full siblings - the same proportion they share with their own offspring. Therefore, from a gene's eye view, helping can be as good a strategy as reproducing independently when helpers can assist in rearing full siblings. Although staying near home to help can be beneficial in some circumstances, the benefits of cooperating could be reduced or even cancelled out if helpers find themselves competing with close relatives for resources when they do not disperse from the area where they were born. This project investigates the contexts in which cooperation and competition occur to determine if animals can balance these costs and benefits through dispersal behavior. This proposal also tests a novel alternative explanation for the observed association between monogamy and cooperation, asking whether this relationship could be due to environmental factors that similarly influence both mate fidelity and helping behavior. The role of sibling relatedness in the evolution of cooperation is of major interest in the field of behavioral evolution, and the studies proposed here could have profound influences on our understanding of family-based cooperative societies, such as our own. The project will also provide multiple training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in a range of modern scientific skills, including the use of the most cutting edge DNA sequencing techniques. The work will be shared with the public through a community science festival and scientific illustration classes.<br/><br/>This research investigates the relationship between mating systems and social systems using cooperative bess beetles as a model organism. First, fine-scale population structure will be assessed to test the hypothesis that beetles cooperate locally within their highly related family group before dispersing to compete globally with unrelated individuals, allowing them to avoid the costs of competing with kin while maximizing the benefits of cooperating with relatives. The second objective in this study will test the novel hypothesis that certain environments may favor both monogamy and cooperation simultaneously, leading to a correlation between mating and social system that is consequential rather than causal. Conceptually, this hypothesis suggests that the terms in Hamilton's Rule (rB-C>0) may covary in certain environments. Specifically, this study will test whether a single ecological factor, low resource density, reduces the costs (C) of helping (by increasing the costs of dispersal) while simultaneously increasing the relatedness between helpers and their siblings (r) by reducing extra-pair paternity. To assess this possibility, paternity and dispersal will be investigated in response to resource density in both natural and experimental populations of bess beetles. The results of this study could suggest that the terms in Hamilton?s Rule are not modular, but rather covary under certain conditions, changing the way we understand both the correlated evolution of social and mating systems as well as the association between relatedness and cooperation."

In most animals this process is strongly influenced by a molecular polarity present in the unfertilized egg termed the Animal-Vegetal (AV) axis.  In general, cells derived from the egg's animal pole produce ectoderm, while vegetal pole-derived cells produce endomesoderm.  This separation of developmental potential is frequently mediated by localized activation of a highly conserved signaling cascade called the canonical Wnt (cWnt) pathway.  How AV egg polarity regulates restricted activation of cWnt signaling at one pole of embryos is not well understood, but the PI's group has shown that in sea urchins and in the sea anemone Nematostella, this process occurs by the localized 'activation' of a key Wnt pathway protein called Disheveled (Dvl).  Using biochemical techniques the PI's group has identified candidate proteins that are hypothesized to restrict Dvl activity to one end of the embryo. Hence, the goal of this research is to use molecular methods to functionally analyze how the identified candidate proteins regulate Dvl activity in sea urchins and Nematostella.  This work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the earliest separation of cell potential in animal embryos, and provide critical insight into the development and evolution of complex animals. The research involves graduate and undergraduate students, including students from groups under-represented in science.

Surprisingly, the function of sleep remains one of nature's greatest mysteries. During sickness, sleep is enhanced by the immune system. Thus, one function may involve the redistribution of resources allowing for cellular repair following damage that occurs during injury or infection. The genes that regulate sleep are becoming better understood; interestingly, these genes are conserved among distantly related animals from invertebrates, like nematodes, to humans. By identifying novel sleep genes and their interactions in cellular pathways in relatively simple animals, one may gain insights into sleep regulation and function in more complex animals, like humans. This project uses a combination of genetic and behavioral approaches in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, including genetic manipulations, live monitoring of neural activity and animal video analyses, to manipulate and characterize sleep at the cellular and organismal level.  Notably, the gene discovery approaches used in this study will be incorporated into college physiology teaching labs and Philadelphia public school science classes, to provide unique STEM experiences for students focusing on genetics, whole-genome sequencing and behavior.<br/><br/>C. elegans display sleep following exposure to environmental stressors that may damage their cells, a behavior called stress-induced sleep (SIS). The proposed function of SIS is defined as a period of behavioral quiescence dedicated for cellular repairs that occur following insult or injury. Out of the 302-celled C. elegans nervous system, SIS is largely induced by a single interneuron, the ALA. The ALA releases neuropeptides, which induce different aspects of behavioral quiescence.  Recently, neuropeptides encoded by the gene nlp-14 were identified to be central regulators of SIS and are likely thought to be released from the ALA. NLP-14 peptides are both necessary and sufficient for SIS. These sleep-promoting peptides may function by facilitating the reduction of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in a subset of cells that contain high levels of cAMP during times of wakefulness. This project will elucidate the connections of the ALA and NLP-14 peptides to downstream circuitry. This will be examined via the measurement of cAMP levels in sleeping animals using an in vivo biosensor. Additionally, novel downstream cells will be identified through the activation of a red-light activated adenylyl cyclase, IlaC22, in groups of cells. It will investigate the mechanism(s) of activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), a metabolic master regulator that diverts cellular resources from growth to repair, which functions downstream of SIS. Also, this project will determine specific roles for the NLP-14 peptides in a three-part process: (i) the removal of individual peptides using CRISPR-Cas9, (ii) over expression of individual peptides in new transgenic strains, and (iii) a forward genetic suppressor screen to identify NLP-14 receptor(s). The genetic screen will be incorporated into high school outreach laboratory exercises to enhance STEM education in the Philadelphia community. This will be accomplished through field trips and the establishment of a webcast behavioral platform called WormCam.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiosis is a major force of evolutionary change, influencing virtually all aspects of biology, ranging from population ecology and evolution to genomics and molecular/biochemical mechanisms of development and reproduction.  Understanding the nature and mechanisms of these associations is thus of interest from many perspectives.  The most common symbiotic bacteria in the world are called Wolbachia, present in up to 70% of insects and other arthropods such as spiders, mites and crustaceans and also in roundworms causing human diseases of river blindness and elephantiasis and heartworm in domesticated animals. For all these scientific endeavors, we need to more fully understand how Wolbachia are able to influence their hosts' biology, their interactions with their ecology and environment and their biology in natural populations. It is here that the 10th biennial international Wolbachia (Wolbachia2018) meeting enables interactions from multiple scientific perspectives and approaches.  Over 100 of the world's experts on Wolbachia (and related symbionts) from academia and industry gather to present and discuss their recent findings.  The small, informal nature of the meetings enables involvement of graduate students, postdocs, scientists in the beginning of their careers, and participation of under-represented groups in science, providing opportunities for them to present their work. The multidisciplinary nature of research interests of participants fosters interactions from diverse fields of biology bringing together participants who likely would not be able to meet as a group at other conferences due to their individual disciplines. <br/><br/>The obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria symbiont Wolbachia, widespread in arthropods, is best known for reproductive manipulation to enhance transmission through the female germline, leading to cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, feminization or male-killing. Wolbachia alter core host cellular and developmental processes and also have a dramatic impact on the composition of insect gut microbiome.  They can protect their arthropod hosts against insect viruses and can benefit their hosts under times of nutritional stress and they can influence human pathogenic levels in mosquito vectors of malaria, Zika, Dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses.  It is possible to drive and maintain anti-pathogen strains of Wolbachia in mosquitoes in natural populations, enabling a reduction of the frequency and titer of these viral pathogens. Wolbachia are also present in most human filarial nematodes which cause parasitic diseases of elephantiasis and river blindness. Here they are obligate for worm development and reproduction, triggering worldwide projects screening for anti-Wolbachia drugs. The 10th biennial Wolbachia conference is focused around topics including: reproductive manipulation (cytoplasmic incompatibility and other mechanisms); cell biology; genomics, biochemistry and molecular biology; Wolbachia as tools and targets of disease/pest control in insects and filariae; facultative symbiont diversity, ecology and evolution; sex-ratio distortion systems and other symbiont species in arthropods.  The meeting will promote the latest research findings about mechanisms driving these core host cellular and development processes and provide insight into the evolutionary origins of the intracellular lifestyle of endosymbionts and many pathogens.

Molecular mechanisms that contribute to the detection and modulation of cold sensitivity under normal and adaptive conditions are yet to be fully elucidated. This project aims to look at the general problem of cold sensitivity from a novel perspective - through studying cold-tolerant animals, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and Syrian hamsters. In addition to their ability to withstand deep cold during hibernation, squirrels and hamsters are cold tolerant even in the summer active state. This project seeks to understand the cellular and molecular basis of cold tolerance by performing a side-by-side comparison of physiological mechanisms in the squirrels, hamsters and mice. This research will highlight evolutionary changes that shaped cold tolerance and elucidate basic principles that underlie physiology of cold perception in vertebrates including humans. This project takes a multidiscplinary approach, involving behavioral paradigms, live-cell imaging, cell biology and in vitro biophysical analysis of ion channels to address this fundamental biological question. The PI will also run an innovative ""Sensory Physiology Club"" as a core outreach activity. The mission of the Club is to promote scientific education in human and animal physiology among school students from middle- and high schools. This activity will teach aspects of sensory biology and neural mechanisms underlying perception of sensory stimuli to school-aged children from Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts. An established collaboration with the Yale Pathways to Science and SCHOLAR programs, will serve to recruit participants and to monitor long-term impact of this program.<br/><br/>The major goal of this study is to understand the molecular basis of cold sensitivity in mammalian hibernators, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and Syrian hamsters.

To investigate the abundance of temperature sensors in somatosensory system in active hibernators and compare it to mice, a non-hibernating species, histological analysis and live cell ratiometric calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons will be employed. It is known that Nav1.7 is a voltage-gated sodium channel responsible for initiation and propagation of action potential in somatosensory neurons.

In addition, certain species produce toxins and are capable of forming harmful algal blooms. Occurrences of these blooms are expected to increase in the future due to eutrophication and increasing temperatures. One of the factors controlling cyanobacterial populations is predation, but very little is known about the biochemical and genetic mechanisms governing the interactions between cyanobacteria and their predators. The researchers will identify cyanobacterial genes that affect their susceptibility to predators in order to understand predation mechanisms. This knowledge will be useful in guiding the management of recreational and drinking freshwater resources, and that of large scale outdoor culturing of cyanobacteria for biotechnological applications, which is often hampered by predators. Because toxic algal blooms are of general public interest, the researchers will incorporate aspects of this project into their teaching and outreach presentations to engage students and the public in the process of science and its application to environmental problems. They will also develop a module of classes for underrepresented high school students that will introduce them to the presence, abundance, and role of bacteria in aquatic environments. <br/><br/>This project concerns physiological mechanisms underlying the resistance of cyanobacteria to predation by protists. Specifically, the main objective of this project is to identify genes and processes governing the fitness of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus under selective pressure by amoebal and ciliate predators. The investigators have developed laboratory model systems to study grazing interactions and will study these interactions with state-of-the-art random barcode transposon mutagenesis (RB-TnSeq) and omics approaches, as well as genetic, biochemical, and physiological methods.

The work focuses on circuits in the spinal cord of zebrafish embryos, which develop early in life and are simpler and more experimentally-tractable than neural circuits in the brain. The goal is to identify key regulatory genes that instruct cells to grow into one particular population of nerve cells (interneurons) with specific functions in controlling precise body movements. The outcomes of this project will be widely applicable, because these types of nerve cell exist in all vertebrates (including humans). The genes identified in this study and the ways that they influence nerve cell and circuit development are likely to be similar in many different species. This project will significantly increase understanding of how genes instruct cells to develop with particular characteristics, and the roles that specific genes play in the construction of neuronal circuitry. The principal investigators will incorporate this research into their university teaching and presentations made to the general public. This research will contribute to the diversification of the scientific workforce through the active participation of both women and under-represented minorities. The principal investigators will also perform outreach to local city high schools and develop teaching modules for both 9th/10th grade and advanced placement high school Biology students. The aim of these activities is to significantly impact the lives of traditionally under-served high school students and enthuse under represented minority high school students about science and research.<br/><br/>An essential first step in understanding how neuronal networks are generated is determining how distinct interneurons (INs) are specified with particular functional properties. One key property that helps to define INs is which neurotransmitter they use to communicate with other cells. Neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory and INs utilizing inappropriate neurotransmitters form malfunctioning circuits. Therefore, determining how IN neurotransmitter properties are specified is crucial for understanding both IN and circuit development. Relatively little is known about how excitatory spinal IN properties are specified. This proposal will characterize a gene regulatory network (GRN) that specifies spinal IN excitatory properties, using zebrafish as a model system. The investigators have identified genes that encode for 11 different DNA-binding proteins as candidate members of a GRN that specifies V0v IN excitatory (glutamatergic) properties. V0v INs reside in the middle of the spinal cord and have crucial roles in locomotor circuitry. The research team has already shown that four of these genes, evx1/2 and lmx1ba/b are required for correct excitatory fates of V0v INs. In addition, in evx1/2 double mutants V0v INs lose expression of both lmx1ba/b and the other 7 genes, suggesting that all 9 of these genes may act downstream of Evx1/2 in specifying V0v glutamatergic properties.

In mammals, the hippocampal memory system is a conglomerate of brain structures that function together to support memory formation. In doing so, this memory system associates, or binds together, people, items, and places into what are known as episodic memories. Episodic memories afford species the ability to remember vital information that increases the likelihood of survival, such as securing long-term food sources. In this example, the animal must remember ""what"" was stored, ""where"" it was stored, and ""when"" it was stored to retrieve the food before it spoils and avoid illness in the process. Within the hippocampal memory system, the predominant role of one structure, called the perirhinal cortex, is to supply a representation of ""what"" information (e.g., what food item was stored). The perirhinal cortex also appears to be involved in complex stimulus representations outside of its role in episodic memory; however, how and under which circumstances the perirhinal cortex is involved in stimulus representation is currently under debate. This project assesses how the perirhinal cortex functions in a perceptual-specific versus a memory-specific manner in its representation of item information. In addition, the project examines whether the role of the perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation involves connections with structures outside of the hippocampal memory system. Results will furnish significant insight into the contributions of the perirhinal cortex to stimulus representation and how it may differ or complement its well-established role in episodic memory within the hippocampal memory system.  All components of the research program provide training opportunities to students at California State University-Sacramento, a minority serving and primarily undergraduate institution. Additionally, outreach events provide students with opportunities to increase STEM-awareness in the community.<br/><br/>Currently, it is debated how the perirhinal cortex may function in stimulus representation, and if this function is independent from its mnemonic role within the hippocampal memory system. This project uses an associative learning paradigm (Pavlovian fear conditioning) in combination with an innovative inactivation method, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, and cross-lesion techniques to evaluate the functional role of the perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation. Specifically, using the laboratory rat as a model system the project aims to: 1) examine the characteristics of stimuli that require the perirhinal cortex for stimulus representation; 2) determine whether the role of perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation is perceptual, mnemonic or a combination; and 3) determine whether in stimulus representation the perirhinal cortex relies on direct connections with structures outside of the hippocampal memory system.  The research project provides extensive training opportunities to students at California State University-Sacramento, which is a minority serving and primarily undergraduate institution. Further, community outreach, which includes events that expose elementary school girls to science, promote university-wide brain awareness and present research findings to the local community, provide students with opportunities to increase STEM-awareness in the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wnt signaling is a group of highly conserved biochemical signal transduction pathways known for their involvement in various embryonic processes. The presence of Wnt signaling elements in the mature brain suggests that Wnt signaling may also play a role in the regulation of brain functions in the adult. This project examines the role and mechanisms of action of Wnt signaling in the mature brain, from the receptors through which Wnt initiates signal transduction to the targets of the transduction process, such as proteins critically involved in synaptic communication and plasticity. The findings provide insights into how signaling pathways involved in embryonic development are re-deployed to effect lasting modifications in adult organisms. They also inform the development of treatments for conditions in which synaptic transmission is compromised. In addition, the project provides training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented groups, with the goal of increasing their participation in science professions.<br/><br/>Wnt signaling is a highly conserved signal transduction mechanism that regulates embryonic development of metazoans; however, the sustained expression of Wnt signaling components in the mature central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates suggests that Wnt signaling cascades might also play a part in regulating brain function beyond embryonic development.  Recent findings by the investigator indicate that a non-canonical Wnt ligand upregulates synaptic currents mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This regulation requires Wnt receptor RoR2, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of PKC and JNK. The objectives of this project are to: (1) determine how the Wnt receptor RoR2 is activated and whether it is sufficient to initiate the signaling cascade leading to regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and (2) unravel the signaling cascade triggered by activation of RoR2 receptors.  To achieve these objectives, a range of approaches are applied, including biochemical techniques, live fluorescence Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), in some experiments combined with FRET based biosensors, Ca2+ imaging, and electrophysiology. Understanding how RoR2 signals in the mature CNS of vertebrates provides insight into Wnt signaling in general, contributes to better understanding of the regulation of synaptic plasticity, and ultimately offers proof-of-principle evidence for a general process by which biological mechanisms used early in an organism's life can be coopted in the mature organism for homeostatic processes or new biological functions.

This widespread body plan, whether in groups like insects or fish, has been highly successful during the course of evolution. Having a segmented body requires a means of producing repeated segments during the early life stages in which the body plan develops. Recent work has shown that very different types of animals may all use some kind of genetic clock that translates temporally repeated oscillations into spatially repeated segments. The best known ""segmentation clock"" is from studies in vertebrate animals. But if, and how, such a clock operates in the most diverse group of animals on earth, the arthropods, remains relatively understudied. This project focuses on one arthropod, the flour beetle, and explores the genes driving its ""segmentation clock"". This focus arises from previous work showing that the clock changes the rate at which it makes segments midway through development. Ultimately understanding how segmented bodies are built can provide insight into how problems arise along the body axis during human development. This work is a collaborative effort that links undergraduates from a teaching college to scientists at a research university, leveraging the resources of the university. Increasing the exposure of undergraduates at the teaching college to both different and more varied research technologies increases their training and preparation for careers in science.<br/><br/>Animals built from repeated segments are found in three major taxa. Vertebrates use a ""clock""-like mechanism to sequentially pattern their segments. Recently the first unequivocal segmentation clock has been demonstrated in an arthropod: the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The current model of the Tribolium clock differs in intriguing ways from the better-known vertebrate models. This project focuses on three key features of the Tribolium clock. First, the Tribolium clock begins patterning before the cell movements of gastrulation, raising the question of how clock outputs are maintained during extensive cell movements. Second, previous research showed that both the clock frequency and cell motility change between early and late segmentation. How are these changes regulated and mutually coordinated? Third, no intercellular signaling pathways have been identified to coordinate the clock between cells, a result supported by a preliminary computational model. Can the clock function cell-autonomously?  This research aims to examine the Tribolium segmentation clock by generating a comprehensive fate map of the blastoderm, and determining the stability in expression of clock regulators during the early transition of gastrulation. It also aims to uncover novel molecular regulators through different phases of the clock, by combining classical promoter dissection with bioinformatics and high-throughput genomics approaches."

Over evolutionary time, males and females can become very different from each other in behavior and structure, but the process behind this divergence is poorly understood. This research focuses on how social interactions shape the elaborate differences we see in nature. An excess of males or females can have a strong effect on many traits by changing how frequently an individual interacts with potential mates or rivals, and therefore how likely that individual's traits are to persist in later generations if they confer a mating or competitive advantage. Using the short-lived roundworm, this project measures the genetic differences between populations kept for 50 generations with mostly females, mostly males, or equal numbers of males and females. Analyzing genetic changes in these populations will reveal the processes by which evolution can alter traits in a population entirely due to male-female interactions. Moreover, comparing the genomes of multiple populations with an excess of males or females will address a core question in evolutionary biology: how similar are evolutionary trajectories when populations face identical conditions? This project will train undergraduate students from backgrounds underrepresented in science using modern genomic techniques, and produce online resources to educate high school students and the public about genomic methods and evolution.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to measure the genomic effect of selection on the differences between males and females and to quantify genetic changes resulting from the behavioral interactions that drive selection. Experimental evolution in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei has yielded evidence that populations faced with a consistently male- or female-biased ratio of reproductively available males to females show differences in morphology and behavior as a consequence of selection. This proposal expands the question of behavioral interactions driving evolutionary change by quantifying the degree of genomic divergence across populations, and identifying signatures of selection at outlier loci across the entire genome. The proposed study will be among the first to directly measure evolution across the genome after a known selective regime of biased ratios of males to females, and one of the few to do so using a behavioral regime. Because experimental treatments were replicated across independent populations, the project will also address the long-standing question of how repeatable evolution is at the nucleotide level. Revealing the genomic consequences of selection generated by behavior is essential to synthesizing proximate and ultimate approaches to understanding dimorphism at the phenotypic and genomic level."

This project will enhance the prediction power of climate change on plant growth and defense and will provide guidance in breeding crop plants that have a balanced growth and defense for the changing environment.

Earlier studies revealed that R proteins could function as temperature sensors and deficiency of abscisic acid antagonizes the high temperature effects on R proteins. This project will first further reveal how temperature and abscisic acid regulate the activity of R proteins to affect immunity. This will be achieved by dissecting the regulation through genetic screens using Arabidopsis autoimmune plants. Mutants with altered temperature sensitivity in immune responses will be isolated and cloned, and the mode of gene action will be investigated. This project will also reveal the genetic basis of variation of temperature sensitivity of immunity in natural populations. This will be achieved by surveying wild Arabidopsis accessions for their temperature sensitivities in disease resistance. Major loci determining the temperature sensitivity will be isolated. With identification of mode of regulation of R proteins by temperature and ABA as well as major strategies in tuning immunity to temperature signals, this project will reveal new mechanisms of signal sensing and signal integration and provide strategies to generate plants with optimal responses to a changing environment."

Previously my lab provided evidence in worms suggesting that these modifications can be stably inherited from cell to cell as cells replicate themselves. These experiments will determine what happens to this information as genes are passed from parents to offspring in mammals. In addition, this research will determine whether or not the information contained in the packaging of DNA can influence the information encoded in the DNA itself. By understanding these basic biological mechanisms, this work has the potential to shed light on the cause of a broad range of diseases, from birth defects to autism. All of the experiments will be carried out in partnership with undergraduates from the nearby Oglethorpe University, under the guidance of Oglethorpe professor Dr. Karen Schmeichel. These students, many of whom are minorities and/or first in their family to go to college, have no access to research using mice, the preeminent human model.

To accomplish this, cells must be able to (A) faithfully transmit patterns of gene expression through mitosis and (B) change transcriptional patterns during developmental transitions. However, the mechanisms that control these processes are currently unknown. To investigate these mechanisms we will use a mouse model of the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1a to determine the function of this enzyme during (1) the gamete-to-embryo transition and (2) in testis stem cells. Through these experiments, we will (A) determine whether histone methylation can function as a transcriptional memory in mammals, (B) investigate the relationship between histone methylation and DNA methylation and (C) determine the function of LSD1 in regulating cell fate. By providing a potential paradigm shift in our understanding of how histone methylation functions to maintain cell fates and how this histone methylation is regulated during cell fate transitions, this work has the potential to highly impact our understanding and treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases, from birth defects to autism."

Sensory system processing is critical for an animal's ability to function within an environment. Humans and higher predator species are primarily visually oriented but most lower animal species utilize olfaction, the sense of smell, as a primary sensory modality. The ability of the olfactory system to detect a huge array of chemicals across wide concentration ranges is a formidable brain processing task. Processing of odor information in the first brain relay station, the main olfactory bulb, is a major contributor to this striking dynamic range. The experiments will increase the understanding of olfactory processing with potential impact on other sensory systems with similar circuit building mechanisms. Understanding the action of cannabinoids on sensory processing will shed light on how cannabinoids lead to altered sensory perception. Rather than purely higher order hallucinogenic action, the experiments will reveal how primary sensory modulation is influenced by cannabinoids and may lead to a better understanding of drug seeking behaviors. This research will provide an educational and outreach experience of exceptional quality for students at all levels with an emphasis on minority students at Howard University. The aim is to broaden the participation of students with minority background to expand the population of minority students as the science workforce of the future.<br/><br/>Marijuana (cannabis) is the most commonly abused illicit drug in the USA. Its bioactive ingredient, THC, activates cannabinoid receptors in the brain in the same manner as brain-produced endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids). The endocannabinoid system is an important intrinsic neuromodulatory system during normal brain function and impacts sensory processing. The experiments take advantage of the highly laminar organization of the main olfactory bulb and a growing body of knowledge on how this system processes sensory information. This research will investigate the role of endocannabinoids in the olfactory system using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, signal imaging and various mouse strains. Specifically, the research will explore how endocannabinoids regulate the activity of output neuron sensitivity and dynamic range in the main olfactory bulb. This will be followed by studying if environmental conditions such as a change in olfactory input engage endogenously produced cannabinoids. The researchers will exploit olfactory deprivation to identify the cellular, membrane, pharmacologic and network properties of endocannabinoid-modulated neural processing in the main olfactory bulb."

Despite extensive research, post-pathogen recognition events leading to NLR activation and induction of defense signaling remain elusive. The investigators recent results indicate that the plant NLR N associates with the SPL6 protein in the nucleus to activate successful immune response against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). SPL6 is also required for NLR RPS4-mediated defense against Pseudomonas syringae bacteria expressing AvrRps4 effector. Therefore, SPL6 appears to be a conserved nuclear component that acts as a bridge between an activated NLR and induction of defense genes. In this project, the investigators will use a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical, genomics, proteomics, and cell biology based approaches to understand the subcellular dynamics of NLRs during immune signaling. Precise function of SPL6 during immune signaling will be determined by identification and characterization of direct target genes that are regulated by SPL6. Also SPL6 interacting proteins will be identified and characterized. Results from the project will advance the field of immunity by providing mechanistic insights into NLRs function especially with respect to their spatial distribution and dynamics during defense.

A particularly intriguing hypothesis, though poorly investigated, is that the loss of regenerative capacity in higher vertebrates coincides with the presence of a strong adaptive immune response.  Now, the recent discovery of complete tissue regeneration in wild African spiny mice (Acomys) compared to the failure to regenerate in a co-occurring rodent (Myomyscus), allows a comprehensive examination of the links between immunity and regeneration in wild, pathogen-exposed, and fully immunocompetent adult mammals.

Quantifying immune and inflammatory changes at the cellular and molecular level in response to injury is expected to reveal a bias towards innate immunity and anti-inflammatory molecules in regenerators, and a shift towards adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory responses in non-regenerators.  Project results will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms that constrain regenerative ability in mammals.  <br/>Because regeneration biology is a fascinating topic with great potential to excite students about science, the investigators will engage U.S. and international students of all ages in the project.

Broad interest in these epidermal ""biofactories"" is heightened by the fact that many gland-derived substances are useful for industrial and medicinal purposes. Although significant progress has been made in cataloging the metabolic ""parts list"" of glandular trichomes, fundamental questions concerning the regulation of metabolism within, and development of, the trichome structure remain to be answered. In keeping with the analogy of the trichome gland as a biochemical factory, this project seeks to address two major questions concerning the operating principles of this highly evolved structure: how are various assembly lines (metabolic pathways) within the factory coordinated, and how do changes in the demand for the assembled products (bioactive compounds) influence the way in which the factory is constructed? The research has potential to transform current views of metabolism by advancing the concept of cross regulation between seemingly disparate metabolic pathways, and defining new roles for well characterized enzymes. <br/><br/>Glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of bioactive compounds that protect aerial plant tissues from biotic and abiotic stress. The metabolic activity of trichome glands is often dominated by the production of terpenoids and flavonoids, which comprise two of the most diverse and economically important classes of compounds in nature. Progress in elucidating biosynthetic pathways for these and other secondary metabolites has far outpaced efforts to understand the developmental cell types and structures that are often key to the biological function of defense chemicals. This research project builds on recent studies showing that terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of tomato is coupled to gland development and, intriguingly, is coordinately impacted by the action of the flavonoid biosynthesis enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI). The broad objective of the project is to combine experimental and mathematical modeling approaches to achieve a systems-level understanding of how trichome metabolic and developmental processes are integrated. The experimental approaches are grounded in the use of purified trichome glands (a single cell type) for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, as well as powerful genetic tools to manipulate functional processes affecting gland development and metabolism. The research may also reveal new roles for a well-studied metabolic enzyme (CHI) and broaden current views of how small molecules control metabolism.

By building mathematical models of how the brain detects and eliminates errors in performance and by directly recording the electrical activity of individual brain cells, these studies will provide novel insights into this key aspect of brain function. Additionally, the investigators will develop course materials based on their research to be used to enhance science education in underserved communities in the Atlanta area. The benefit to society of this work is therefore twofold: it will reveal previously unknown mechanisms of brain function and will improve the general public's understanding of neurobiology.<br/><br/>The proposed experiments combine a range of experimental approaches to test a simple model of how the brain rapidly corrects errors in behavior. The central hypothesis is that the brain is able to rapidly correct errors in vocal behavior because brain cells that control the vocal output are affected by the sensory (auditory) feedback arising from vocal output. By collecting electrical recordings of single brain cells during both vocal behavior and auditory stimulation, experiments in Aim 1 will compare the sensory tuning (the tuning for the pitch of a recently-heard syllable) and motor tuning (effect on the pitch of vocal output) of neurons that control behavior. Studies in Aim 2 will use lesions and reversible inactivations to selectively eliminate auditory input to premotor neurons, thereby facilitating tests of the hypothesis that such sensory inputs are required for rapid online error correction."

This research investigates beetles living at high elevation in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to study how variation in genes coding for proteins that process energy and respond to stress affect metabolism and performance. The research seeks to discover the contrasting roles of oxygen, which is necessary to process metabolic fuel, and temperature, which changes the rate at which these processes occur. It is a synthesis of genomics, physiology, and animal natural history that will provide a unique opportunity to understand how organisms cope with environmental change. It will provide insight into the evolution of thermal plasticity and may unveil novel genes associated with temperature and oxygen stress. The work will increase research opportunities for students at two primarily undergraduate universities. Students will be trained in experimental design and analysis, proposal and paper writing, and in the presentation of research at scientific meetings, which will provide them with marketable skills for the modern work environment. Educational materials will be developed for K12 education, which illustrate the use of genomic tools for answering scientific questions. Outreach events detailing the results of this project will occur at public events in the San Francisco Bay Area and near field sites in Inyo County, California.<br/><br/>This project will develop and use genomic and transcriptomic tools to gain mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of adaptation to temperature and atmospheric oxygen in the Sierra willow leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis. This research will test the hypothesis that interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have pervasive effects on gene expression that scale up to differences in metabolic capacity and performance. To test this hypothesis, the stress response will be investigated in larvae from populations that differ with respect to mitochondrial and nuclear genetic background and that occur along a latitudinal and steep altitudinal temperature gradients. Larvae will be reared at a high elevation laboratory in chambers where oxygen level and temperature will be manipulated. At the end of the growth period, larvae reared under these different conditions will be exposed to different temperatures and running speed measured. Genetic variation associated with fast and slow running speed after stress will be identified using whole genome sequencing of individuals in the upper and lower tails of the running speed distribution. Differences in expression of genes of interest will be assessed using RNA sequencing for these same individuals. Genes of interest (e.g. stress, hypoxia, central metabolism) that have non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation along natural temperature or elevation gradients will be identified in whole genome sequencing experiments and used to build 'SNP panels' in which larger numbers of individuals can be screened. Rearing conditions described above will then be used to generate larvae in which metabolic physiology will be examined. Metabolic enzyme activity, mitochondrial respiration, oxidative damage and thermal tolerance will be measured, SNP variation recorded, and differential expression of genes of interest quantified using quantitative PCR. Taken together, this research will reveal how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes interact to cope with stress in a changing environment. The project will establish a new international collaboration with world leading experts in insect genomics from Stockholm University (Sweden). International collaborators will help organize and lead a two-week hands-on workshop on genomics and bioinformatics for undergraduate and Masters students from Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University. Additionally, Masters students from Sonoma State University will travel to Stockholm University to receive training in genomics and bioinformatics. International activities and travel will be supported by funds from the International Science and Engineering section of NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."

Because few animals eat wood, there is great interest in those that can. Previous research in this investigator's laboratory suggested that shipworms digest wood using a method that is different from any other animal. Most animals that eat wood, e.g. termites or wood-eating roaches, do so with the help of enzymes made by bacteria and other microbes that live in their digestive systems.  Shipworms, however, have few bacteria in their digestive systems. Instead, they rely on bacterial symbionts that live inside the cells of their gills to produce the digestive enzymes they need.  This is unique because no other known animal relies on intracellular symbionts to produce digestive enzymes. In this project, the enzymes produced by these bacteria will be identified in order to characterize their functions, and to determine how these enzymes are transported from inside the cells of the shipworm's gills to their digestive system. These enzymes are potentially valuable because they convert wood, the most abundant biomaterial on earth, into soluble sugars that can be fermented into renewable biofuels, e.g. ethanol. They may also be used in production or processing of paper, textiles, detergents, food, animal feed and waste materials. This project will contribute to Ocean Genome Legacy's ongoing postdoctoral training and graduate education programs, public outreach for environmental literacy, and internship programs for undergraduate, high school, and minority students. The investigators will also work with colleagues in the Pacific Northwest to develop a STEM education program for Native Alaskan students and teachers that integrates shipworm biology with traditional Native Alaskan ecological knowledge and Western science; this program will utilize educational curricula translated into the Haida language."

Fungal decomposition of wood is a critical component of the carbon cycle, impacts soil productivity, and has the potential to be exploited in the production of biofuels and other 'green' technologies. The major wood-decaying fungi are mushroom-forming (Agaricomycetes). The physical characteristics and chemical composition of wood vary among plant species, and most wood-decaying Agaricomycetes have characteristic wood substrate ranges. However, it is not understood why individual species of wood decaying fungi tend to occur on specific plant hosts. This project will investigate the mechanisms of substrate specificity and substrate switching in wood-decaying Agaricomycetes using a combination of analyses of genes expressed during decay, and physical and chemical characterization of the decay process. Fungal enzymes that are involved in wood decay or degradation have potential applications in emerging bioprocesses, such as energy-related bioconversions, including biofuel production, and bioremediation. Enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that allow different species of fungi to exploit particular wood substrates could help guide development of genetic resources that could be used for such applied purposes. This project will support one Postdoctoral Fellow and two graduate students, and will provide training to undergraduates at three collaborating academic institutions in the US. To bring information about fungi and wood decomposition to a wide audience, this project will create interactive exhibits and develop accompanying public programs at the Worcester EcoTarium (http://www.ecotarium.org/), a science and nature museum which serves over 140,000 visitors annually including large numbers of students from regional public schools. Exhibits will illustrate fungal diversity, the decay process, and the role of fungi in the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on four species of Agaricomycetes (with distinct substrate preferences) with available genome sequences. The fungi will be cultured on solid wafers of four different tree species (two conifers and two hardwoods). Transcriptome profiling will be performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, focusing on genes encoding enzymes known or suspected to be involved in wood decay, as well as co-expressed genes of unknown function. Phylogenomic analyses will make use of all available genomes of wood-decaying Agaricomycetes, focusing on gene families that are likely to play a role in decay, as informed by expression profiles. Physical and chemical characteristics of decay will be addressed using microscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical analyses of colonized substrates. The proposed research is a collaboration between researchers with expertise in fungal systematics and molecular evolution, wood decay and forest products pathology, fungal genomics, and genetics and biochemistry of decay systems. This project will capitalize on recent advances in genomics of wood-decaying basidiomycetes. It will provide insight into the functioning and evolution of fungi in forest ecosystems, and create a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the specific plant-derived compounds that affect expression of particular fungal genes."

During development, this cell divides and its progeny turn on distinct subsets of genes to build different types of cells like those in muscles, nerves and blood.  This process is precise; tissues and organs are the correct size and shape and they occur in the correct position.  This process is also robust; development unfolds accurately under a wide range of environmental and genetic assaults. Yet changes to animal physiology in disease or evolution are often due to alterations to development. This award addresses this critical paradox: how does development both buffer against change, and yet respond and adapt to change to produce new creatures? With respect to broader impacts, fewer than 10% of entering life science Ph.D. candidates will attain tenure-track academic jobs.  Scientific training must therefore include skills that are useful in academia, government and the private sector.  This award will support efforts to teach scientists how to communicate effectively, which is a fundamental and universally valued skill.  The principal investigator will expand the scope of an innovative graduate course she directs, tailor it for undergraduates, and make modular materials available online so that other people can deploy it.  This teaching effort will lead to a new generation of scientists adept at communicating across disciplines and with the public, and with skills that are highly valued in careers outside of academia. <br/> <br/> The central hypothesis is that developmental precision and robustness are encoded in the circuits of gene regulatory networks, and by extension, the regulatory DNA that wires them together.  By studying how such circuits are built, and how they behave under perturbation, we can learn how they can be precise, robust and yet evolvable.  Shadow enhancers, distinct pieces of regulatory DNA that drive the same target gene expression pattern, increase the precision and robustness of developmental systems but the mechanism is unknown.  The DePace lab conducts their studies of gene regulatory networks in fruitfly embryos because the rules governing development are extremely similar between fruitflies and other animals, including humans, but fruitfly embryos offer substantial experimental advantages for deciphering the underlying principles.   The DePace lab recently uncovered a pair of shadow enhancers in fruitfly embryos that respond to the same regulator in opposite ways. This project will interrogate the function of this novel circuit using quantitative experiments and computational models. Aim 1 will determine how the activity of the bifunctional regulator (a transcription factor) is controlled.  Aim 2 will determine how the circuit affects patterning precision and robustness in the embryo.  This research will: 1) probe the molecular mechanism of transcription factor bifunctionality, a general problem in interpreting the genome, 2) determine the role of a novel transcriptional circuit in embryonic patterning precision and robustness and 3) establish a powerful model for studying the mechanism and consequences of distributed regulatory DNA, which is a significant but under-studied class."

While cooperation among relatives is both well documented and relatively well understood in everything from slime molds to primates, cooperation among unrelated individuals, especially those that also compete directly with one another, remains more puzzling. The proposed research will study what social and environmental factors cause unrelated male marine fish to either cooperate or compete with one another. This research will also identify the genes, brain regions and hormones that control these behaviors - currently, there is little specific information on these mechanisms - and measure how cooperative versus competitive interactions affect reproduction in this species. Understanding what shapes cooperation, competition and conflict is not only of general interest, but can also inform conservation and management because negative interactions such as conflict and competition have been shown to increase a species risk of extinction. This project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students on a variety of biological methods including field research on marine fish and tools for understanding the genes underlying social behavior. The professors and students involved in this research will also offer internships to high school students, education outreach lectures and online activities aimed at women and girls interested in science fields and careers. Several involved students will be from an undergraduate-focused institution which draws a number of non-traditional STEM students which will allow these students direct training opportunities that they otherwise would not have access to.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of our research is to understand how social interactions and selection interact to shape variation in reproductive behaviors. We aim to quantify male plasticity in social behavior, document neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying plasticity in male social behavior, and determine how variation in male social interactions affects selection. To address these aims, we propose research on wild-living ocellated wrasse (a marine fish, Symphodus ocellatus). Ocellated wrasse males exhibit three alternative reproductive types: 'nesting males' provide parental care, defend territories, and form cooperative associations with unrelated 'satellites', who cheat by sneaking fertilizations but help by reducing reproductive competition from 'sneakers' (who do not cooperate or provide care; Stiver & Alonzo 2013). We adopt an integrative approach that allows us to examine the reproductive fitness consequences of variation in cooperation and competition and identify neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying this variation and behavioral plasticity."

The bacteria gain by being transported to new localities in amoeba spores while the amoeba gains by being able to seed out populations of food bacteria in new areas. The result is a sort of primitive farming. The investigators will first explore how selection works on this system using experiments to test new theory that could also be applied to more complex systems. Second, they will explore how the partnerships are formed. Are the partners attracted to each other and are particularly good food bacteria favored? Finally, the investigators will determine many of the amoeba and bacterial genes that control this interaction, exploiting the fact that both partners can be genetically manipulated. The students and post-doctoral individuals in this project will gain valuable training in important areas like genomics.

This model system for symbiosis exploits short lifespans, small genomes, genetically manipulability, and other advantages. The PIs will use a new theoretical framework to estimate components of selection for both partners (Aim 1). This framework draws on analogies with kin selection theory and promises to be similarly useful.  Second, they will explore partner association, testing how Burkholderia and Dictyostelium find each other, whether they succeed at choosing beneficial partners, and whether there is preferential association with beneficial food bacteria.  Finally, they will discover many of the genes involved in the symbiosis and how they have evolved (Aim 3).

This project focuses on understanding, at the cellular level, how the earliest responses upon injury lead to correct regeneration of missing tissues. How does the animal know that it has lost organs and how does it make the right cells in the right places? Although many animal species can regenerate, the details of the underlying molecular pathways and how these pathways compare across species remain unknown. Biological pathways acquire changes in all species over the course of many generations, but evolution tends to preserve pathways that are essential. Therefore, by studying two species of distantly-related worms that both have impressive regeneration abilities, this project will reveal which aspects of regeneration are shared, and hence essential. The general principles of regeneration identified through this work will have relevance to regenerative medicine. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral researchers involved in this research, the broader impacts of this project include providing hands-on experiences with molecular studies of evolutionary biology to students at local public schools. Teachers will receive training, equipment, supplies, and staff support to implement curriculum that incorporates experimental molecular biology. Direct experiences with how science is practiced in research labs will enhance retention of students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Technical paragraph:<br/>Many extant lineages of animals can regenerate any missing cell type, raising the possibility that the earliest animals to evolve were capable of ""whole-body"" regeneration. Functional studies of multiple species in phylogenetically informative positions relative to each other are needed to evaluate how the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying regeneration have evolved. This research will leverage the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and the acoel Hofstenia miamia; both regenerate all missing tissues, are easy to culture, and offer high-throughput screening of gene function via RNAi.  Importantly, Hofstenia offers an additional advantage: the availability of accessible embryos, which will enable functional studies of regulatory DNA proposed here. Acoels represent the earliest lineage of animals with bilateral symmetry (Bilateria), and therefore, comparisons of acoels and planarians will reveal the evolution of GRNs over 550 million years of evolution. Wnt signaling, which has a conserved role in correctly specifying tissue identity along the anterior-posterior axis in Hofstenia and Schmidtea, will serve as an anchor-point for a systems-level approach to identify upstream and downstream GRNs. Wound-induced gene networks that control the Wnt pathway will be identified by transcriptome profiling and RNAi. Assays for open chromatin will be used to identify enhancers and direct transcriptional regulators of Wnt pathway components. RNAseq and candidate gene approaches will be used to identify downstream gene networks controlled by Wnt signaling. Together, these experiments will reveal the regulatory mechanisms through which wound-induced gene networks control a putatively conserved module for patterning new tissue in two animal phyla."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots.

One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

This project will explore the decision-making abilities of one of these neuron-less organisms, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Of particular interest is (1) how P. polycephalum integrates noisy and sometimes contradictory information when selecting a food source; and (2) the role of its past experiences (e.g. the resources it has previously visited) on the outcome of its future choices. Because P. polycephalum is a macroscopic unicellular organism, it can be easily manipulated and observed, while retaining similar characteristics to other neuron-less, microscopic creatures. It is therefore a perfect model system to understand how most living beings integrate complex and dynamical information.

In particular, the transfer and integration of information from different stimuli will be examined. The efficiency of the slime mold decision-making mechanism when the available information is noisy or contradictory will also be tested. Finally, whether the slime mold's natural positive geotaxis (motion in the direction of gravity) can be conditioned (i.e., reversed here) if food is always present uphill will be determined. This would indicate that the slime mold is capable of spatial associative learning (a first in the slime mold), and that its decision-making process is capable of adapting to the characteristics of the environment through which it moves.

This science education center reaches over 20,000 visitors per year (majority are K-8th graders). By collaborating with the Elm Fork Education Center students will be exposed to the field of genetic modeling and the cellular responses to environmental stress in animals. Completion of this project will elucidate novel mechanisms regulating mitochondrial function relative to whole animal biology. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to dissect the pathways controlling sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation and to determine if sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation are mechanistically linked. The approach is to use the genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans to conduct cellular, molecular and genetic analysis on mutants with altered sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation. The investigators will test the hypothesis that 1) central features of mitochondrial function and the response to oxygen deprivation in an intact whole organism are sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation; and 2) sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation are mechanistically linked in mitochondrial functions. To test these hypothesis the following Specific Aims will be conducted: Aim 1: Determine how ceramide biosynthesis and iron regulation impact mitochondria functions and whole organism stress responses; Aim 2: Conduct genetic suppression analyses to identify signaling pathways that interact with ceramide biosynthesis and iron regulation; Aim 3. Utilize genetic analysis to determine if neet-1 and ceramide biosynthesis mechanistically interact to regulate mitochondrial functions. The proposed research could have a transformative impact on the way sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation is viewed in the context of mitochondrial homeostasis. The project provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, an outreach-based learning module that focuses on the genetic model system C. elegans will be offered through a program at the UNT Elm Fork Education center. This outreach program will have a broad impact since it reaches over 20,000 visitors per year."

Due to the potentially mutagenic nature of their transposition activity, it has been assumed that TEs are heavily suppressed, if not completely silenced, predominantly through epigenetic mechanisms, i.e., non-inheritable chemical modifications introduced into chromosomes. The researchers' analyses suggest, however, that TEs are rapidly and transiently derepressed in response to pathogen infection. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that TEs play important roles in transcriptional reprogramming/activation in response to biotic stress and that their activity leads to phenotypic plasticity and stress adaptation. For the host plant, the proposed ability of TEs to transduce environmental challenges into epigenetic modifications that lead to stable genetic changes should confer significant evolutionary advantages. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which stress adaptation is mediated by epigenetic changes and clarifying their relationship to TE activation following biotic stress will be tremendously valuable for developing new traits in the plant breeding industry. The proposed research also will allow undergraduate students, as well as high school students and their teachers, to investigate solutions to a real-world problem via experimentation using high-throughput assays that will provide a robust dataset after a limited training period. The results of these analyses will be presented at local, state and national science fairs.<br/><br/>The researchers'  analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility suggests that the promoters and/or 5' proximal regions of many defense genes contain TEs that display heightened and dynamic chromatin accessibility in Arabidopsis after pathogen infection. These TE-associated chromatin regions exhibit infection-induced dynamic interactions with MORC1, a protein implicated in both RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) and immunity in plants. Given that i) TEs are suppressed mostly by RdDM, ii) pathogen infection induces a burst of TE expression, and iii) both TE transcription and mobility are modulated by the RdDM pathway, epigenetic factors involved in RdDM will be investigated to test the role(s) of RdDM and TEs in the induction of defense genes following pathogen infection. To this end, specific TEs and RdDM components will be silenced or knocked-out to monitor DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcription levels for both targeted TEs and their proximal defense genes following infection. TEs' role in stress adaptation will also be examined by inducing biotic stress-induced TE transposition and determining if novel TE insertions confer stress-induced transcription of their proximal genes in subsequent generations. Altogether, this project seeks to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between TEs and both immunity and stress adaptation."

Understanding why animal signals are so complex and how they evolved is a major research focus for scientists in many fields. Such research can add to our knowledge about how the senses work, how attention and learning shift perception, and how changing environments can impact communication (among others). In this project, scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Auburn University use a systems approach to study the evolution of courtship displays in a well-developed animal system. The team uses genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of more than 23 species. For each species, they also describe the communication system in detail and how it changes with environmental conditions. They then test hypotheses about system properties such as robustness and flexibility/evolvability. The project will advance our understanding of complex animal signals, and test long-standing theories from engineering and genomics about system structure and function. The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students. Research findings will also be integrated into a science exhibit that will be made available to the general public at natural history museums in Nebraska and Alabama. <br/><br/>Despite an appreciation of the prevalence and importance of complex signals in animal communication, progress towards an evolutionary analysis of signal complexity has been constrained by a lack of hypotheses and tools that can compare signaling systems across taxa and assess evolutionary and functional implications. This project develops and tests a novel theoretical and empirical paradigm by integrating a systems approach into animal communication research using Schizocosa wolf spiders. North American Schizocosa include 23 species that vary in their use of vibratory and visual courtship displays. Specific aims are (1) to assess the structure and dynamics of vibratory and visual courtship signals of each species in different environments; (2) to generate a robust phylogeny; and (3) to use phylogenetic comparative methods to test (i) the hypothesis that degeneracy facilitates robustness across changing conditions and (ii) whether degeneracy facilitates (or constrains) elaboration and signal divergence. The simultaneous measures of vibratory and visual signals across contexts combined with a robust phylogeny will enable unparalleled opportunities for evolutionary analyses of complexity. This research will facilitate an integrative and comprehensive understanding of the evolution, diversification, and maintenance of complex animal communication and provide a roadmap for similar studies across distinct taxa and signaling systems."

Corals are animals that form the structural basis of these reefs, and contain microscopic algae inside their cells.  This mutualistic partnership or symbiosis provides the foundation of the entire diverse coral reef ecosystem.  While a great deal of attention has been focused on the environmental threats to corals and how and if corals will survive climate change, there remains only a partial understanding of the microscale cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the coral-algal symbiosis. Insight into regulation of this symbiosis will provide a stronger foundation for studies of the impact of ocean warming, acidification and other anthropogenic stressors on coral health.  This project will bring together a coral biologist , a chemist, and a cancer cell biologist, to examine the intricate molecular and cellular conversations  that the partners of the symbiosis engage in to initiate and maintain the symbiosis.  The project will also examine how these conversations go awry and lead to symbiosis dysfunction and breakdown during the phenomenon of coral bleaching, a stress response to elevated temperature that results in coral death and reef degradation.  In addition to studying corals in the field, this project will also study sea anemones which are an excellent proxy for corals, many of which are endangered and are difficult to culture in a laboratory setting.  This project will contribute to the training of scientists and expose school-aged children to coral reef and symbiosis science.<br/><br/>Many cnidarians, including corals and anemones, engage in symbioses with photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), and together they form the trophic and structural foundation of the coral reef ecosystem.

Recent work suggests that as a result of learning synapses grow and that the size of the synapse is what stores the components of memories. The aim of the proposed work is to visualize directly this growth process in brain tissue using a newly developed super-resolution microscope, and to understand why such structures have stable size once learning has occurred. Instability would result is loss of memory, so evolution is thought to have favored ways of maximizing stability. To gain insight into the mechanism of stability, physical and computational model systems will be used. If the principles that underlie stability in the face of variable size can be understood, the outcome of this work could open the door to a new era in nanotechnology in which these principles could be utilized, leading potentially to novel solutions to problems in self-assembly. Additional contributions of this project include the organization and instruction of a course in the scientific programming language, MATLAB, in an enrichment course for students from groups under-represented in science and technology, and the opportunity for US trainees to participate in an international collaboration. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on supramolecular structures that do not have fixed size but can exist in multiple different sizes, all of which are stable. Thus, if a stimulus causes the transition from one stable state to another, the structure has information storage capability (memory). The investigators termed this type of structure variable-size stable structures (VSSS). Interest in VSSS arises from two seemingly unrelated fields:  neuroscience and the physics of nanostructures. The molecular basis of memory is one the most fundamental unsolved problems in neuroscience. Evidence strongly suggests that synapses grow to encode memory. Thus, memory storage in the brain appears to be a structural problem, and efforts need to be made to understand the structural principles that make memory storage possible. The project integrates cutting-edge optical microscopy with theoretical modeling. Utilizing a newly-available super-resolution microscope, the investigators will make the first effort to observe synaptic growth during synaptic plasticity in real time. The goal of the theoretical efforts is to develop a physical theory of VSSS and evaluate different models, including ones that have emerged from the study of synapses. Questions to be addressed include: (i) The importance of cooperative interactions among multiple components to generating stable yet kinetically accessible and reconfigurable assemblages. (ii) Design principles that lead to self-terminating assembly, such as growth by finite-size modules. (iii) Mechanisms by which nonequilibrium energy consumption changes the limits of VSSS. An ultimate goal is a generalized theory for nonequilibrium self-assembly capable of describing VSSS. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division."

Nearly all terrestrial organisms, from single-celled to multi-cellular species, possess internal biological clocks allowing for synchronization of internal processes with the environment. In mammals (including humans), a master circadian clock in the brain synchronizes other clocks throughout the brain and body, maintaining temporal organization in the whole organism. The importance of these clocks becomes apparent during times of temporal disruption, with the degradation of circadian rhythms associated with numerous negative health effects. However, to fully understand how ""broken"" clocks cause negative effects, understanding how they promote optimal function under normal circumstances is necessary. The goal of this research is to understand how circadian clocks promote normal functioning of brain circuits important in complex behaviors like decision making, attention, and cognitive flexibility. A mouse model is used to investigate how normal or disrupted circadian rhythms regulate the size, shape, and function of neurons in the brain, and how these changes affect cognition. Advanced techniques in the measurement of brain chemistry, imaging, 3-dimensional reconstruction of neurons, and pharmacology is used to help understand how circadian clocks maintain normal function, and how disrupted clocks lead to negative outcomes. An integral component of this award engages rural and urban undergraduate students in outreach involving the Mobius Science Center and Children's Museum in Spokane, helping increase awareness of how biological clocks affect physiological function, from the simplest organisms, to our own brain.<br/><br/>Significant inroads have been made in understanding the cellular and molecular function of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock. However, the fundamental role of circadian rhythms in brain areas underlying complex behaviors, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), remains illusive. Using environmental circadian disruption as a tool, this research determines how circadian rhythms modulate normal PFC function at the behavioral, physiological, structural, and biochemical levels. This research builds upon our findings that circadian disruption impairs cognitive flexibility and causes atrophy of PFC neurons. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that circadian rhythms promote normal PFC function primarily through modulation of glutamatergic signaling, since glutamate is crucial for optimal PFC function. Circadian disruption effects on the PFC is determined by examining PFC mediated behaviors, and through the use of implantable biosensors to determine effects on extra-cellular PFC glutamate in real time. To establish a causal role for glutamate, pharmacological manipulation of PFC AMPA and NMDA signaling is undertaken. Confocal microscopy and 3-D reconstruction of PFC neurons is used to investigate circadian changes in neural morphology and dendritic spines, primary sites of excitatory signaling. Biochemical studies determine how normal and abnormal circadian rhythms drive membrane trafficking of glutamate receptors, providing another substrate on which circadian rhythms may act to modulate PFC function. The third and final experimental aim is to determine whether changes in a rhythmic hormone (corticosterone) mediates these effects, which would provide a mechanism by which normal and disrupted timing cues are relayed to extra-SCN brain regions."

The project involves forward and reverse genetics, genome-wide proteomic and metabolic approaches, and live-cell imaging to understand how the growth and metabolism of rice blast fungus in host rice cells is facilitated and linked to host immune suppression. This could lead to the development of novel crop protection strategies targeting molecular pathways that are critical for the growth of the fungus but are not required for the normal function of the host cell, and could shed new light on both the basic principles of cell growth, and on the nature and regulation of host-microbe interfaces. The educational objectives will expand scientific education by stimulating undergraduates' science learning, preparing graduate students for scientific life beyond the university, and inspiring scientific interest in underrepresented high school students.<br/><br/>In order to cause plant disease, and in common with other plant-associated microbes, the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae initially forms intimate associations with living rice cells and grows for the first few days of infection as a symptomless biotroph, elaborating invasive hyphae (IH) wrapped in plant-derived membranes, acquiring nutrients and evading rice innate immune responses as it spreads cell-to-cell. After 3-5 days of infection, M. oryzae undergoes a lifestyle transition to necrotrophy, resulting in disease symptom development, host cell death and sporulation from leaf lesions. How M. oryzae controls the development of IH during the biotrophic growth phase while simultaneously evading or suppressing host innate immunity, and what triggers the transition to necrotrophy following the extended biotrophic growth phase, is almost entirely unknown at the molecular level. This project seeks to address these knowledge gaps by generating and characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are unable to colonize host plant cells. This is expected to uncover novel cellular, biochemical, and genetic mechanisms governing rice infection. Results from the proposed work could point to novel sources of disease resistance, shed light on fundamental concepts of plant host-microbe interactions, and indicate how beneficial plant-fungal interactions might be promoted while those detrimental to crop health are diminished.

While scientists have understood the basic mechanisms of de novo fatty acid synthase (FAS), recent studies have indicated that our understanding of the molecular events that organize and regulate this pathway are poorly understood; and engineering these pathways remains challenging. This project aims to carefully study the molecular regulation of the FAS pathway in bacteria and algae, with a goal toward enabling metabolic engineering this pathway for biofuel applications. The investigators have already demonstrated that the development of an alternative fuel source from microalgal biomass has created many significant opportunities for education and community outreach. With the potential to provide the requisite energy for continued human progress and development, algal biofuels will almost certainly play a major role in our energy future. As such, a significant aspect of this research aims to augment student and public awareness of the need for alternative energy sources and the positive impacts of the widespread adoption of algal biofuels.<br/><br/>The basic pathway and mechanisms of FAS are included in most introductory biochemistry textbooks, and much has been known about the organization of this pathway for several decades. However, attempts to engineer FAS in various organisms have been met with unpredictable results that highlight many gaps in our understanding. Recent evidence has demonstrated that protein-protein interactions of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) and FAS enzymes play fundamental roles regulating the reactivity and timing of FAS processing, and these interactions are key to the successful engineering of these pathways. This proposal aims to systematically characterize the protein-protein interactions within the FAS of the bacterium Escherichia coli. To study these specific interactions, the investigators have developed a toolkit that includes chemo-enzymatic ACP-substrate conjugation coupled with solution-phase protein NMR to elucidate the specific amino acid residues involved in these interactions. These tools will be applied to study heterologous combinations of FAS enzymes for metabolic engineering of FAS from E. coli and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The proposed research will be accompanied by the development of a new Masters of Science program targeted to train the future biofuels scientists that builds upon a certificate program begun by the investigators."

The process of cell division produces new cells by the cleavage of a pre-existing cell called a mother cell.  Mother cells undergo cell divisions with different orientations such as longitudinal or transverse and equal or unequal.  Since plant cells are surrounded by rigid cell walls, once they are generated, plant cells are unable to adjust their position relative to neighboring cells.  Thus, ensuring that the mother cell undergoes a cell division in the correct orientation is critical for normal plant growth.  To fully understand cell division orientation, this proposal lays out a plan to identify the proteins that regulate and execute this process.  This research will be conducted in Zea mays (corn), an agriculturally important crop plant.  The results of this project will allow for more effective engineering of crops for maximum growth and yield in addition to advancing understanding of a fundamental cellular process.  Importantly, previous research has shown that many factors needed for plant cell division are also needed for animal cell division meaning this research is likely to advance our understanding of cell division in many organisms.  Finally, during the course of this project, a Cell Biology lab module that allows every biology major at the University of North Texas to participate in a novel scientific investigation will be implemented and evaluated for effectiveness at promoting student learning.<br/><br/> The final output of this project will be the identification and characterization of proteins needed for normal plant growth and development.  The first objective of the proposal is to characterize the protein disrupted in the Zea mays dcd2 mutant.  In this maize mutant, the partitioning cell wall that forms during critical cell divisions in the leaf is misoriented resulting in abnormal cell shapes.  The methods that will be used to identify the causative mutation include a combination of positional cloning and RNA-seq while the localization of the DCD2 protein and further characterization of the phenotype will be accomplished by observing fluorescent fusion proteins and immunolocalization.  The second objective is to isolate additional maize mutants that form abnormal division planes, roughly map five of the new mutants, and determine the causative mutation in two mutants.  The methods that will be used to accomplish this objective include conducting a genetic screen, using RNA-seq to identify the position of the mutations within the genome, and characterizing the mutant phenotype by observing fluorescent fusion proteins and immunolocalization.  The third objective is to integrate improvements in science education at the University of North Texas with further characterization of the proteins needed for division plane orientation in plants.  To accomplish this objective, students in the Cell Biology Lab will conduct novel research in a classroom setting by conducting a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the proteins identified during first two objectives of the project."

In developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and India, the combination of rapid population growth and declining agricultural production is a major threat to food security, and hence to political stability. There is thus an urgent need to improve the immune system of plants so that they can defend themselves against disease.  This project is focused on understanding an underappreciated component of the plant immune system that appears to be shared with humans, extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are microscopic spherical packages that can carry information from one cell to another within an organism.  Recent work in animal systems, including humans, has revealed that this information can reprogram recipient cells so that the receiving cell changes the proteins it produces, and hence the properties of the cell, and in some cases, the ability of a cell to prevent infection by a virus.  Recent work in the Innes laboratory indicates that EVs may serve a similar role in plants.   This research project aims to address basic questions about how plant EVs are produced, what they carry, and how they may contribute to plant immunity. The answers to these questions will facilitate development of disease resistant crops.  In addition, this project will provide hands on plant science activities to elementary, high school and undergraduate students, with a special focus on underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the genesis and roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the context of plant immune systems.  Although EV release by plant cells is known to be stimulated by fungal and bacterial infection, nothing is known about their function. Over the last two years, the Innes laboratory has developed a method for purifying and quantifying EVs from Arabidopsis leaves. Analysis of purified EVs revealed that they carry microRNAs and are highly enriched in proteins associated with response to biotic and abiotic stress, suggesting that EVs may participate in intercellular communication.   The experiments described in this proposal will address the following questions: 1) Does the protein and RNA content of plant EVs change in response to specific biotic stresses?  2) Are known endomembrane trafficking proteins required for production of plant EVs? 3) Are EVs required for host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) of genes in a fungal pathogen? Question 1 will be addressed using proteomic and RNA-seq analysis of EVs purified from Arabidopsis leaves following treatment with various biotic stresses. Question 2 will be addressed by quantifying EV production in mutant Arabidopsis lines deficient in specific endomembrane trafficking proteins. Question 3 will be addressed using a forward genetics screen to identify Arabidopsis mutants that are unable to perform HIGS of genes in the fungus Fusarium graminearum. This screen will uncover Arabidopsis genes required for HIGS, and will establish whether EVs transport small RNAs from the host to the pathogen.

Transcription factors are proteins that function by binding DNA and turning genes on or off. AGL15 is an example of a 'bimodal' factor that directly expresses some genes, but directly represses other genes, and the focus of this project is to understand how this occurs. Because mechanisms of dual functionality are not well understood in any organism, the proposed work will have broader relevance to understanding these types of factors. Furthermore, AGL15 is involved in seed development, and seeds are of critical importance to humans, with the majority of our diets directly derived from seeds. Additionally, work will contribute to understanding somatic embryogenesis, a step allowing genetic engineering of plants to meet agricultural challenges. Training will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and undergraduate researchers, including hosting interns from the nearby community college. This project will support a number of continuing outreach activities as well as developing a new relationship with an elementary school with a high percentage of students from economically disadvantaged homes.<br/><br/>AGL15 is an Arabidopsis MADS-factor involved in developmental phase transitions that directly expresses some genes, but directly represses others. The mechanism of repression may be explained by AGL15's interaction with SAP18/TPL that is part of a histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). This interaction requires an LxLxL/EAR motif that is found within the C-terminal domain of AGL15. The yeast 2-hybrid screen that identified these interactions also isolated proteins that could account for how AGL15 recruitment to gene regulatory elements leads to expression of direct targets. These intriguing proteins, which include another MADS-factor, SEP3, that interacts with chromatin remodeling components and a plant-specific transcription factor (LBD40), will be further investigated, as will the HDAC interaction, and in planta interaction with AGL15 tested. The LxLxL motif, needed for recruitment of the HDAC complex, will be assessed for functional importance in development. Prior NSF support has allowed the PI's lab to map genome wide association of AGL15 with DNA sites and response of target genes. Similar determination of the in vivo association of AGL15 interacting proteins will allow co-occupancy to be determined that may be revealing for mechanism of regulatory outcomes. Some interactors will be assessed for how occupancy changes from embryo to seedling. Prior work on AGL15 has provided clues as to how different complexes with different regulatory outcomes are recruited to specific loci. While mapping association will aid in determining mechanism, experiments are also proposed to directly address the hypothesis that activation may involve multiple binding sites for AGL15 and looping, whereas repression does not. Finally, select targets will be further assessed for epigenetic regulation and function in development. Training at all levels of science are an integral part of the project."

This project is designed to further our understanding of how the timing of flowering is regulated by environmental cues at a molecular level in the grasses. Despite the fact that grasses include important food crops such as wheat, rice and corn and potential bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, sorghum and miscanthus, little is known about how flowering is regulated at a molecular level in the grasses. This project will employ Brachypodium distachyon as a model because this grass species exhibits a large range of natural variation in flowering behavior that is genetically tractable, and it is straightforward to identify the genes responsible for genetic differences in flowering among different Brachypodium varieties. Understanding achieved by this project has the potential to inform research designed to improve the productivity of food and bioenergy crops.  This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs for independent careers in science, and will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology and plant biology.

These chemical compounds are produced by the organisms in extremely minute amounts, but are highly potent, capable of triggering dramatic physiological changes, and absolutely essential for proper development and defense against harmful environmental conditions or infections. In plants, there are nine classes of plant-produced chemical hormones. These control a wide-range of developmental processes, from seed germination to fruit ripening, and responses to the environment, from drought to herbivore attack. Despite the critical role of plant hormones, they are difficult to study, in part because they are hard to detect and quantify in order to know exactly when and where they are produced, transported and sensed. One way around this problem is to measure the specific biological effects triggered by the hormone instead of quantifying the hormone itself. Thus, growth regulators can be ""visualized"" with the help of hormone-responsive fluorescent reporter genes that make parts of the plants glow under UV light if the hormone is active in that part of the plant. This project seeks to produce a set of synthetic reporter genes that will make it possible to monitor the activity of multiple hormones at once, all in a single plant. Importantly, these reporters will be useful for the analysis of hormones in many plant species, including crop and ornamental plants and even trees. In addition to the obvious benefits to the plant research community highlighted above, this project is an ideal opportunity to introduce synthetic biology concepts and strategies to science undergraduates. Herein, the NCSU Biochemistry Undergraduate Research & Training Program (BURT-P) lead by the co-PI Dr. Ascencio-Ibanez (that currently houses 25 students) will be used as an effective platform to recruit and train up to 10 new students interested in synthetic biology. Furthermore, all personnel (the PIs, the postdoc and undergraduates) will take part in a previously established Plants4Kids bilingual outreach program for kids. Dr. Diego Orzaez, the developer of GoldenBraid gene assembly technology, will exchange materials, outreach ideas, and coordinate efforts for the popularization of gene assembly strategies among plant biologists.<br/><br/>A major limitation of existing hormone reporters is their inability to monitor multiple hormones in a single plant line. Currently, the best available synthetic reporters (e.g., DR5:GUS, DR5v2-GFP, or DII-Venus for auxin and EBS:GUS for ethylene) need to be crossed or transformed into the background of interest (e.g., one's favorite mutant) individually due to the presence of the same selectable markers, identical reporter genes, and/or major silencing issues caused by the repetitive use of the same or overlapping DNA elements. If the plant community had access to multi-gene hormonal reporter constructs and transgenic lines, it would greatly facilitate the multi-faceted phenotypic analysis of pleiotropic mutants, as well as of the effects of stresses and other treatments that typically alter several hormonal pathways in parallel. Furthermore, visualizing the activity of several hormones simultaneously may help to uncover interactions and relationships between these growth regulators. For example, it is easy to imagine the tremendous impact simultaneous monitoring of the dynamics of all major hormones' activities with cellular resolution will have on our understanding of processes as important as drought, nutrient deficiency, plant-microbiome interactions, pathogen responses, or hormone crosstalk."

Seeds represent a major source of food for human and animal consumption. The experiments in this project will investigate seed differentiation in higher plants. The long-term objective of this project is to use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to uncover the gene regulatory networks, or DNA control circuits, required to ""make a seed."" There are several reasons that support the selection of soybean for this study. Soybean seeds are one of the largest sources of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world, providing $30 billion annually in farm value to the U.S.  Soybean seeds are uniquely suited to study the basic processes controlling seed development. Finally, there are enormous genetic resources for soybeans that will facilitate progress, including the availability of its entire DNA sequence.

Wind induces adaptive, structural changes in stems, such as secondary thickening. Roots penetrate hard substrate and modify their growth and architecture as obstacles are sensed. Despite this ability to adapt, mechanical stresses contribute significantly to annual crop loss and decreased yield, problems likely to worsen with changing climate and increasingly stormy and erratic weather. Therefore, identifying the components of mechano-sensing and signaling is a priority for crop improvement.  This project explores the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), generally known as an intracellular energy source, as an extracellular signal in response to mechanical stress (e.g., wind). The three groups involved have specific expertise in studies of plant signaling, especially related to extracellular ATP, as well as studies of how plants respond to mechanical stress. This project is relevant and timely regarding sustainable agricultural; better adapted crop plants are needed urgently but there is little information on how plants withstand mechanical stress. The research will identify new components of how stems and roots respond to wind and soil hardness, respectively, helping crop improvement programs for lodging, wind resistance and penetrative root growth. In addition to aiding water and nutrient uptake, deeper roots with more lateral outgrowth improve soil structure, thus improving water and nutrient retention. Wind damage also inflicts losses on forestry and urban landscapes. This project will provide foundational understanding on the adaptability of plants to mechanical stress and for improving crop yield for the increasing global population. <br/><br/>Recent evidence points to an intersection between mechanobiology and purinergic signaling in plants. Purinergic signaling is the transduction of signals elicited by extracellular purine nucleotides, such as ATP. Specifically, extracellular ATP (eATP) has been found to increase as cells expand (a process that generates intrinsic mechanical stress) and eATP also increases in response to extrinsic mechanical stress. Moreover, eATP affects root development and governs the transcriptional response to wounding as the most severe mechanical stress. The recently discovered plant purino receptor, Arabidopsis DORN1, provides a unique opportunity to explore at the molecular and whole plant levels the relationships between purino- and mechano-signalling. Critically, the structure of DORN1 indicates it serves as a reporter of cell wall state. In this project, two, cross-disciplinary purino-signalling groups (Stacey and Davies) and a mechanobiology group (Moulia) will delineate the DORN1 mechano-purino signaling system using molecular, biochemical and biophysical approaches. Structure-function relationships of DORN1 will be probed to determine how its attachment to the wall can regulate its eATP binding activity. The cell membrane Ca2+ channels mediating the DORN1-dependent Ca2+ increase in roots and stems will be characterized. Phenotyping mutants will determine the impact of DORN1 and downstream Ca2+ channels on stem posture control, adaptive response to wind, root Ca2+ response and mechano-regulated growth. Outcomes of the research is important to agriculture and society because the results obtained in Arabidopsis can be translated to crops. Understanding how plant walls cope with mechanical stresses will provide a platform to overcome crop lodging and increasing crop resilience to environmental challenges. Combined with training students in interdisciplinary science, the project outcomes will contribute to food and national security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Blake Meyers.<br/><br/>All flowering plants have structures called anthers that produce male pollen during reproduction. In the sub-group of monocots, a unique class of small molecules, called small RNAs, are expressed in anthers just before pollen is produced. These small RNAs regulate how genes are turned on and off at specific times, thus likely ensuring normal reproduction. Despite the importance of these small RNAs, details of their function and regulation are not well understood. This project investigates when and how these small RNAs evolved in the grasses, thereby clarifying their functional importance in the context of evolution. Information will be conveyed through an outreach project with public gardens. In collaboration with the Longwood Garden (Philadelphia, PA) and the Missouri Botanic Garden (St. Louis, MO), the genome of the Longwood Hybrid water lily will be sequenced, and the resulting information will contribute to a public garden exhibit that connects genetics to evolution in this group of early-diverging flowering plants.   <br/><br/>The aims of this project are to identify the key evolutionary events underlying the origin of 21 and 24nt phased, secondary, small interfering RNAs particularly in the monocots. Interestingly, a duplication event led to the presence of a monocot-specific Dicer-like protein, DCL5. Transcriptome sequencing of meiotic anthers across diverse groups of monocots will be used to carefully pinpoint the phylogenetic placement of the duplication event that led to the divergence of Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) and Dicer-like 5 (DCL5) in the monocots. After identifying this duplication event, a phylogenetically diverse subset of DCL5 genes will be transformed into the maize male-sterile DCL5 knockout to attempt to rescue function. Simultaneously, in situ hybridization and immunolocalizations will be performed across phylogenetically diverse monocots to identify potential changes in protein localization in the anther, further clarifying function during reproductive development."

This process is called abscission and relies on specialized cells within abscission zones. Over the past decade, research using the model plant Arabidopsis has revealed multiple components that regulate the programmed loss of cell-to-cell adhesion in organ abscission zones. However, little is currently known about the mechanisms that determine where abscission zones are located or what genes are necessary for their development. In Arabidopsis flowers, abscission zones form at boundary regions between the floral organs and underlying stem. The focus of this research is to investigate whether a subset of the genes known to control the position and development of organ boundaries subsequently direct the formation of organ abscission zones. Advances made in understanding the basis of abscission zone development may lead to novel technologies to modify organ abscission in crop plants. The ability to induce organ abscission would enhance fruit thinning and facilitate mechanical harvest, while inhibition of abscission would prevent premature flower or fruit drop and improve postharvest quality. The educational activities of this project will provide advanced training in genetics for University of Mississippi undergraduates and research opportunities for individuals preparing for graduate education in STEM fields. Increased genetic literacy is vital for preparing future health-care professionals and citizens alike to understand the rapid advances underway in medical diagnostics, gene therapy and personalized medicine. <br/><br/>Although key signaling pathways that activate and inhibit organ abscission have been outlined in Arabidopsis, the progression of events underlying abscission zone differentiation remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that abscission zone placement is influenced by the formation of lateral organ as well as inter-organ boundaries. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate how the gene networks that pattern organ boundaries in leaves, flowers and fruit contribute to abscission zone positioning and specification. Mutants that perturb the definition of the sepal-receptacle boundary and displace organ abscission zones will be used as tools to investigate the hypothesized roles of selected organ boundary genes. Phenotypes of mutants with organ boundary and abscission zone defects will be assessed using scanning electron microscopy, histological analysis and molecular markers of organ boundary and abscission zone cells. An expected outcome of these studies is the identification of candidate transcriptional regulators of abscission zone-specific signaling molecules. Genetics education for University of Mississippi undergraduates will be enhanced by introducing an Honors Genetics course, engaging Honors students in the PI's organ boundary experiments and designing new Genetics laboratory modules. To provide training opportunities to individuals with diverse educational backgrounds, the PI?s laboratory will host multiple post-baccalaureate and undergraduate research interns during the funding period. The PI has an established track record of mentoring young scientists, many of whom are women and/or individuals from ethnic backgrounds underrepresented in science."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of plant immunity will ultimately help develop better disease control strategies.  An integral part of plant immunity is the activation of a large number of defense-related genes upon pathogen infection.  This project is focused on a potential master regulator of plant defense gene expression with a critical role in plant immunity.  The main goals of the project are to i) identify the spectrum of genes that are directly regulated by the regulator, ii) establish the mechanisms by which the regulator activates plant defense-related genes and iii) determine the regulation of the regulator during the activation of plant immune responses.  Results from this project will enhance our understanding of the process of differential gene expression fundamental not only to plant immune systems but also to all complex processes in living organisms.  This project will integrate research with training, learning, diversity and outreach activities. Postdoctoral fellows and students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training in a wide range of molecular approaches.  The project will be integrated into classroom learning for students, including those from underrepresented groups and high school students, to increase the general public's awareness of science and technology.<br/>  <br/>Transcription reprogramming in plant immunity is achieved through concerted action of specific transcription factors (TFs) through recruitment or release of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II).  The RNAP II holoenzyme contains a group of general TFs (GTFs), which are believed to be required for transcription of all genes.  Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is a GTF for RNAP II.  Interestingly, Arabidopsis have 14 genes encoding TFIIB-related proteins including six plant-specific TFIIB-related proteins (pBrps).  This project is focused on Arabidopsis pBrp1.  The pbrp1 mutants are compromised in both disease resistance and defense gene expression. In uninfected plants, the pBrp1 protein is retained on the plastid envelop and nuclear pBrp1 is detected only when proteasome pathways are inhibited.  Pathogen infection induces pBrp1 accumulation.  These results suggest that pBrp1 is a regulated GTF of a special RNAP II holoenzyme that directs a defense gene transcription program.  To test this hypothesis, the project will identify the direct target genes of pBrp1 using genome-wide transcriptome profiling and ChIP-seq.  The direct association of pBrp1 with RNAP II will be determined using co-immunoprecipitation to confirm pBrp1 is a GTF for RNAP II and to identify other components in the complexes with roles in the action and regulation of pBrp1.  The protein levels and nuclear translocation of pBrp1 will be manipulated to determine the importance of the tight regulation of pBrp1 for balancing plant defense with fitness.  These studies will help elucidate transcriptional regulation of plant immunity, as well as the intricate mechanisms for timely, accurate and effective activation of plant defense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mary Gehring.<br/><br/>Seeds are important for humans; seeds make up most of our diets and are a key part of the ecosystems that we depend on. Understanding what factors influence seed development is necessary to improve seed crops (such as wheat, corn, rice, and soybean), as well as to ensure the production of viable offspring when re-introducing genetic diversity into inbred crop varieties. Only recently have technologies and systems been available to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA bases and to associated DNA-packaging proteins) play during plant reproduction. While epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for seed development in a small number of distantly related plant species, the actual patterns and effects of epigenetic modification appear to vary substantially between species. To predict how broadly epigenome-based technologies for crop improvement and plant breeding can be applied, the patterns of epigenetic modifications that are fundamental to all flowering plants, or are specific to particular lineages must be determined. This project will provide an otherwise lacking foundation for understanding how the role that epigenetic processes play during reproduction has evolved across flowering plants. To do so, epigenetic modifications and their association with gene expression during seed development will be identified in the emerging model system Nymphaea thermarum, a member of one of the most ancient flowering plant lineages. Training objectives include genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include outreach to local school teachers through the Whitehead Partner program and the development and distribution of a module for early-science education that explores the importance of biodiversity and basic research to agriculture and food security. This module will be presented as part of the Arnold Arboretum Summer Institute, and will be available at https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand epigenetic modification and its impact on gene expression during seed development. Specific objectives include 1) determining the dynamics of epigenetic modification during reproductive development in N. thermarum through immunolocalization of methylated DNA and histone marks, methylation-sensitive DNA sequencing and chromatin profiling and 2) identifying genes that are maternally- or paternally-imprinted during early embryo and endosperm development using hybrid crosses and tissue specific gene expression analysis. By comparing results from Nymphaea to information from model species, deeply conserved patterns of epigenetic modifications and imprinted gene expression will be distinguished from those that are derived within either monocots (such cereal crops) or eudicots (such as Arabidopsis). Results of this project will be published on open-access pre-print servers and peer-reviewed journals, and information will be available on the website https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.<br/><br/>Keywords: seed development, embryo, endosperm, epigenetics, Nymphaea, comparative genomics and epigenomics<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will study a gene called RAMOSA3 that produces an enzyme that can degrade a type of sugar called trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P).  T6P is thought to be an important hormone in plants, similar to insulin in animals.  The researchers have found unexpected properties of the RAMOSA3 enzyme, including being present in the nucleus of cells, and interacting with a class of proteins that bind to ribonucleic acids.  These findings suggest that RAMOSA3 is doing something different to its expected function as an enzyme, and the researchers will explore the ways in which RAMOSA3 is able to control how plants grow.   Broader Impacts: Plants adapt their growth according to available resources, but how crosstalk between metabolism and development is achieved is not well understood, and the project outcomes will give a clearer understanding of relevance to agricultural productivity. The researchers will also contribute to outreach and education by training graduate and high school students as well as a post-doctoral researcher. The investigator directs a program, which allows local high school students, including minorities, to experience life in a research lab.  The investigator's lab will also develop an educational and research exchange with a Middle School in Brooklyn, New York, with hands on experiments used to confer the excitement of scientific research to students, and discussions of how science benefits society. <br/><br/>The disaccharide trehalose and its intermediate trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) have emerged as important regulators of sugar metabolism in plants, and trehalose pathway mutants or mis-expression lines have specific phenotypes affecting branching, flowering time and drought sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanism by which T6P controls these processes is unknown. This research project is to understand the mechanism by which RAMOSA3 (RA3), which encodes a trehalose phosphate phosphatase (TPP) enzyme, controls maize shoot branching.  Preliminary results suggest that RA3 acts in the nucleus, where it is found in sub-nuclear domains, and interacts genetically and physically with RNA binding proteins. These findings suggest that RA3 may act in a gene regulatory network with RNA binding proteins, to control expression of downstream genes in response to metabolic signals. The discovery of RNA binding proteins that interact with RA3 provides an opportunity to understand how a metabolic enzyme can control gene expression necessary to direct plant development or other aspects of plant growth. The research will build on these findings by elucidating downstream factors and interacting proteins and RNAs that will lead to new emergent models of how RA3 functions as an integrator across scales in metabolic and developmental control.

Despite this, tremendous diversity in ecology, physiology, and behavior, biological processes are fueled by a set of highly similar reactions that govern metabolism. The general rules of how biological processes operating at higher levels of biological organization emerge from the reactions of metabolism and how this determines organism responses to environmental conditions are unknown. The research aims to explain a fundamental rule of life that holds across single- and multi-celled organisms: the observation that an organism's performance increases as a function of temperature to an optimal level, after which it declines as temperatures increase (i.e., the thermal performance curve). The research will test the hypothesis that the response of metabolism to temperature determines thermal performance curves through levels of biological organization, culminating in the survival and reproduction of organisms and the subsequent growth of populations. The research may have broader impact for science and society, as it will provide an experimental and mathematical research framework that can be applied to diverse systems, including socio-economically important systems, such as agricultural, pest, and disease species. Because the components of metabolism are shared between humans and the organisms studied, fundamental links between metabolism and an organism's performance will provide critical information on health issues related to metabolic disorders.<br/><br/>The research integrates molecular, physiological, ecological, and mathematical approaches to measure how organisms respond to change in environmental temperature. The experiments will measure change in thermal performance curves in response to shifts in temperature at multiple levels of biological organization, from mitochondrial function to population growth. This measurement will be done in two well-studied systems - the fruit fly Drosophila and the ciliate Paramecium - to test the general hypothesis that plastic and adaptive metabolic responses to temperature will scale up through levels of organization to affect population-level properties such as growth rate. The research will develop a general mathematical framework using a nested set of functions to describe causal and predictive relationships that link metabolic responses up through population- and ecosystem-level responses to the environment. The framework aims to identify where rules exist, but also to discover where emergent properties arise in the biological hierarchy. This framework can be adopted by researchers working in diverse systems to link functional trait responses across levels of biological organization, and to predict how the organisms and communities that they study may be impacted by changes in the environment. The experimental design explicitly sets the stage for future work that will link (epi)genome- to-phenome responses and incorporate systems genomics approaches within this framework.

Understanding how they function is critical to a sustainable food supply. At the tip of the root is the root cap, a tissue that helps guide the root through soil and protects the root from soil stresses. Cells of the root cap are continually produced and released into the surrounding soil. Released cells help repel pathogenic microbes from the root and are an important part of plant defense. The features governing root cap cell release are currently unknown. This knowledge is necessary to fully understand root function and to develop plants with increased productivity. This project will use the model plant Arabidopsis to identify the essential genes and characteristics that govern root cap cell release. It will provide training to undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist and will engage the local community in plant root biology. The knowledge generated will enhance our ability to develop plants with increased productivity.<br/><br/>Part II, Technical:<br/>Roots are pivotal to plant health and crop productivity. The root cap provides essential functions for the whole root, and is critical to root growth and health. Root cap functionality is dependent on a stable root cap size. In the columella root cap, located at the tip of the root, size is maintained by a balance between root cap cell release and columella cell production. The mechanism underlying root cap cell release is not well understood, yet this process has crucial implications for root protection from environmental stress. This project will identify the mechanism through which the transcription factor, NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7 (NLP7), controls root cap cell release and will identify additional regulators of root cap development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The project's research goals are to: 1) determine how the subcellular and tissue localization of NLP7 alters root cap cell release and 2) identify NLP7-regulated genes and networks that function in root cap cell release. This work will be instrumental for understanding the genes that govern root cap development and will lead to crops with enhanced growth and productivity, especially in environments with pathogenic soil microbes.

A deeper understanding of how plant pathogens cause diseases lays foundations for developing effective strategies to keep plant diseases under control for sustainable agriculture. Many plant pathogens including fungi, bacteria, nematodes, bacteria, and oomycetes rely on effectors that they deliver into plant cells to suppress plant defenses and establish infection. The plant hormone salicylic acid plays an essential role in plant defense against pathogen infection. The investigators discovered that a bacterial type III effector targets the master regulator of salicylic acid-mediated plant defense for degradation, causing disease. This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism and biological consequences of the bacterial effector-mediated degradation of the master regulator, and identify a mutant form of the regulator, which cannot be degraded by the effector. This non-degradable regulator could potentially be used to generate disease-resistant plants. Disease-resistant crops are critical to feed a global world population on a decreasing amount of arable land, and to reduce the amount of environmentally harmful pesticides. Two graduate and four undergraduate students will be supported through this project each year. Funding will also be used to train middle school teachers and students in South Carolina to detect citrus greening disease before citrus trees show obvious symptoms in SCienceLab. By connecting hands-on cutting-edge experimentation with urgent real life plant pathology problems, this project will inspire students and make them aware of the importance of plant science. <br/><br/><br/>This project focuses on the targeting of SA-activated NPR1 by the Psudomonas syringae type III effector AvrPtoB. Though it has been known for many years that NPR1 plays an essential role in both local and systemic plant defense, it has not been reported that a pathogen effector targets NPR1. SA facilitates the reduction of plant cytosolic NPR1 oligomers into monomers, which enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional coactivators of plant defense genes. This project showed that SA promotes the interaction between AvrPtoB and NPR1, suggesting that AvrPtoB only interacts with the active form of NPR1. This project demonstrated that AvrPtoB targets NPR1 for degradation, dependent on AvrPtoB's E3 ligase activity. In addition, this project found that the master regulator of SA signaling, NPR1, plays an important role in MTI (MAMP-triggered immunity). This proposal seeks to 1) investigate how SA promotes the interaction between NPR1 and AvrPtoB by determining if AvrPtoB only targets monomeric NPR1 protein, 2) determine the molecular mechanism of AvrPtoB-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1, 3) show how NPR1 contributes to MTI, and 4) determine how AvrPtoB targets SA-activated NPR1 to disrupt NPR1-dependent MTI to subvert plant innate immunity. These studies will provide fresh insights into effector biology and increase our understanding of MTI and the molecular and biological functions of NPR1 and SA in plant defense. The work will involve training of two postdoctoral fellows to perform research and mentoring of undergraduate students from under-represented groups to empower them to pursue careers in scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, an equally serious challenge soon awaits. Immediately after fertilization, the new embryo must rapidly remodel its surface so that additional sperm can no longer bind, and it must create an impenetrable barrier that will protect the embryo during development. The goal of this project is to explore protective barrier formation in the nematode worm, C. elegans, which offers several advantages over other organisms typically used to study this process (humans, mice, sea urchins). The work will be conducted entirely by undergraduate and high school students at Pomona College, a small liberal arts college dedicated to training the next generation of exceptional scientists. A diverse group of students in the investigator's research lab, as well as students in an Advanced Cell Biology course, will use genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to investigate eggshell assembly in C. elegans. These studies will harness the power of C. elegans as a model system to explore both widely-conserved and species-specific strategies that contribute to protective barrier assembly in nematodes. Common features will lend insight into evolutionarily-conserved reproductive strategies, while species-specific features could identify new therapeutic targets to fight parasitic nematode infection of humans, plants, and animals. Importantly, this award will also create a mentorship pipeline for students historically underrepresented in science to support their persistence in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Before fertilization, the C. elegans vitelline layer (analogous to the mammalian zona pellucida, fish chorion, and sea urchin vitelline layer) forms on the oocyte surface and is comprised of at least three proteins with an interdependent relationship. CBD-1 functions at the top of the hierarchy and recruits PERM-2 and PERM-4, who in turn maintain each other's localization. Interestingly, CBD-1 also organizes a separate protein complex involved in fertilization and egg activation (the EGG complex). After fertilization, the PERM complex is remodeled into the outermost eggshell layer, while the EGG complex is internalized. Little is understood about the mechanism of vitelline layer remodeling, or how the relationships among vitelline layer proteins promote these events. In Aim 1 of this project, students will examine the interdependence of the PERM and EGG structural scaffolds at the oocyte surface before fertilization by analyzing null mutants and domain variants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In Aim 2, students will use biochemical and phenotypic analyses to investigate how PERM-2 and PERM-4 contribute to the structural and functional changes to the vitelline layer after fertilization. In Aim 3, they will explore whether similarities exist between nematode and mammalian vitelline layer structure and assembly.

By studying the wing at the beginning of development, when the tissue is simpler, the direct effects of genes that regulate cell growth can be tested. The research will use important resources that have been developed in the nationally funded genome projects and will involve molecular biology, genetics and microscopy. It is expected that a comprehensive view of how a limb is established from the earliest stages will emerge. The genes used in limb development in fruit flies are conserved with other animals, including humans, so that general principals will be learned. To increase public understanding of science, an animated movie will be made in conjunction with the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design. The movie will highlight the beginning of fruit fly genetics, which started a field of research that has fueled the fundamental understanding of animal biology for more than a century.   <br/><br/>As animal body parts and organs grow in size and complexity, cell proliferation must be linked to cell fates so that the final structure has the correct pattern and proportions.

Their influence is amplified by their ability to reproduce rapidly and in great numbers, which is determined by the number of offspring each female can produce. Differences between females in their reproduction is partially controlled by males, who can manipulate females by transferring chemicals that influence their physiology and receptivity during mating. This project involves fundamental research to identify the chemicals transferred by males that influence female mating behavior, the underlying genes, and the mechanisms by which females protect themselves from these substances. These studies may lead to products that inhibit female reproduction, and which can be used for safe and effective biological control of insects. The project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists by supporting undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. These students will disseminate their work through scientific scholarship, and will participate in community outreach programs centered on the public's fascination with insects. These include activities that foster an interest in science in elementary-school children and that enhance scientific literacy by providing resources for the study of insects to high school teachers. <br/><br/>Nuptial food gifts are food items given by males to females and are an integral feature of various insect mating systems. In decorated crickets, nuptial food gifts take the form of a spermatophylax, a gelatinous mass forming part of the male's spermatophore and consumed by the female. Although nuptial gifts advance the fitness interests of males by maximizing sperm transfer, their effect on the fitness of females remains unclear. The researchers will employ experimental evolution to explore the role of conflicting male and female goals in driving the evolution of the chemical composition of male nuptial gifts and female responses to them in decorated crickets. Specifically, they will vary the intensity of selection and conflict by manipulating the ratio of males and females in replicate populations, and then monitor, simultaneously, the evolutionary responses of males and females. They will use gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to track evolutionary modifications in the free amino acid profile of the spermatophylax, and targeted gene expression to assess changes in key genes. Female evolutionary responses will be assessed using behavioral assays to assess the gustatory appeal of gifts, and a comparative transcriptomics approach will be used to characterize differential gene expression in brain and gut tissue of females from different selection lines. By coupling a powerful experimental evolution design with state-of-the art functional genomics, they aim to provide one of the most comprehensive examinations of how selection and conflict contribute to the evolution of a widespread reproductive adaptation in insects."

Recently, extracellular ATP was suggested to come into play in plant defense responses. Understanding molecular mechanisms that control ATP-induced defense signaling will help identify potential molecular targets to engineer disease resistance into crop plants; this development will not only improve the yield and quality of biomass but it will also reduce the need for added chemicals to control plant disease. Thus, the project is poised to bring significant economic, environmental, and social benefits by preventing pollution in the environment and reducing input costs for producers. The project includes the education and training of post-doctoral researchers and students. Moreover, the project will integrate research and education by providing summer research projects to high school students. A strong emphasis will be placed on recruitment and training of underrepresented groups, especially for the high school summer intern and undergraduate student positions. This training will offer students a potentially empowering and educational glimpse into scientific research, and prepare them for future careers in science. In conclusion, the proposed project integrates research and education to achieve beneficial results for education, agriculture and the environment.<br/><br/>The energy currency molecule, ATP, is released into the extracellular space following cellular damage, where it acts as a danger signal for damaged-self recognition in multicellular organisms. Very recently, the first plant purinoceptor, P2 Kinase (P2K), was identified, and further suggested the involvement of extracellular ATP in the plant defense responses to wounding or damage from infectious organisms. However, how the signaling pathway connects to the plant defense response after ATP binding to the P2K receptor is unknown. The long-term goal is to develop an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating extracellular ATP signaling during plant defense responses. The immediate objective is to determine how P2K receptor-mediated ATP signaling regulates plant defense responses. The project?s aims are: (1) Elucidation of sensing mechanism of extracellular ATP by the P2K receptor; (2) Identification and functional analysis of molecular components that act downstream of the P2K receptor; (3) Identification and characterization of signaling networks between extracellular ATP and other stress hormone signaling pathways, so as to elucidate the role of extracellular ATP in plant defense response. This research is crucial to understanding how plants survive pathogen and herbivore attacks as well as giving the researchers a unique opportunity to compare animal and plant purinergic signaling systems, in order to define components and responses that are evolutionarily conserved."

However, although studies in birds have made seminal contributions to fields such as development, neurobiology, and immunology, bird research has been hindered by the limited availability of gene manipulation tools, including the ability to make transgenic birds. In other model species, such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies, it is much easier to generate transgenic animals that directly assess the role of a particular gene of interest. Some of the most successful transgenic technologies rely on gene-editing and isolating and modifying stem cells, and then transplanting them into hosts. In contrast, in birds, the advanced age of embryos at the time eggs are laid, and the lack of efficient viral vector tools has greatly limited gene manipulation efforts. To address these limitations, the investigators develop and improve gene manipulation and stem cell technologies in birds. The project focuses on the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird that is the most commonly used animal model to study the neural and genetic basis of human speech and language. Since other animal models commonly used in research do not have vocal learning, this is the first time that efficient methods for gene manipulation are being developed for a vocal learner species. Other beneficiaries include all avian research and possibly any egg-laying species, many of which are used to address questions in diverse areas of biology. The project also provides research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and outreach to communities typically underrepresented in science and technology fields.<br/><br/>To provide gene manipulation tools and protocols that will be useful not only to the songbird research community, but also to avian researchers in general, the investigators are: 1) generating transgenic zebra finches that express the genome-editing enzyme Cas9 under a ubiquitous promoter; 2) isolating, culturing, and utilizing primordial germ cells (PGCs) to improve the efficiency of generating transgenic zebra finches; and 3) developing efficient viral vectors for manipulating genes in zebra finch cells. Using established methods transgenic zebra finches are made by injecting VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors into freshly-laid fertilized eggs. When combined with CRISPR-designed guide RNAs, these transgenic songbirds enable gene-editing capabilities in a variety of tissues and cell types. To scale up and create many transgenic lines, PGC culture methods are being optimized and viral vectors with higher transfection rates in zebra finch cells developed, thus reducing the materials, time, and animals needed to create a new transgenic line, as well as greatly facilitating gene manipulations. The tools and optimized methods generated by this project will also impact avian research in fields other than birdsong biology. PGC culturing protocols can be applied to other avian species, viral vectors optimized for specific songbird tissues may also have higher transfection rates in analogous cell types of other avian species, and the Cas9-lentiviral construct could be used to generate other strains of Cas9-expressing transgenic birds."

Many members of the mint family produce so-called secondary metabolites, which are by-products of plant chemistry that impart the familiar flavors of peppermint or spearmint in herbal teas or savory culinary seasoning from oregano, basil, lavender and other herbs. Human appreciation and consumption of these botanical compounds supports a growing agronomic industry, with the market for peppermint and spearmint oil alone worth over $200 million in 2011 (USDA); and yet how and why the underlying chemistry of these compounds evolved in the family is unknown. This project studies the chemical pathways required to synthesize flavor compounds using genome sequencing and by identifying all the relevant factors produced in each species. By comparing the resulting large datasets across family members, the project will clarify how such chemical processes evolved in plants. The interdisciplinary nature of the project requires the participation of experts in biochemistry, genomics, genetics and evolutionary biology. In turn, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are trained at the frontiers of science by learning cutting edge genomics research that links directly to products of economic value. Through collaboration with the Michigan State University 4H Children's Garden and the Florida Museum of Natural History, the project offers informative displays and tours so the public can become citizen scientists as they learn about the evolution and underlying ""flavor"" chemistry of the familiar and much appreciated mint family. <br/><br/>The Lamiaceae represents a large family of angiosperms with a high degree of chemical diversity. The major subfamilies within the Lamiaceae, the Lamioideae and Nepetoideae, can be readily distinguished morphologically and also show qualitative and quantitative differences in the synthesis of two key specialized compounds, iridoids and volatile monoterpenoids. These compounds play an essential role in plant reproduction, defense, and signaling and are also the source of mint and other herbal flavors for human consumption. This project integrates genomic, metabolite, phylogenetic, and functional datasets to investigate the evolution of the monoterpene and iridoid biosynthetic pathways in the Lamiaceae. In the first phase, the transcriptomes and metabolomes of a phylogenetically diverse panel of 50 species will be generated and analyzed to identify a robust set of 14 species for focused study. In the second phase, full genome sequencing, expression, and metabolite levels will be conducted on the selected set, thus providing resources to (1) identify specific genes involved in monoterpene and iridoid biosynthesis, (2) elucidate key evolutionary events and mechanisms that led to the extant chemical diversity represented in the Lamiaceae, and (3) functionally test hypotheses about how variation in biosynthetic pathway genes contribute to chemical diversity. All resources from the project, including genome, transcriptome sequences and metabolite information will be publicly available through publications, the NCBI sequence archives, the Dryad Digital Repository and posted on a project website hosted at Michigan State University."

Red alder is used for quality cabinetry, utensils and handles, and as a biomass/biofuels crop. It grows in inhospitable environments and on unproductive land, meaning that it does not compete with food production. Demand for saplings suitable for planting currently greatly exceeds supply. With better understanding of its genetics, scientists would be able to breed trees that grow faster and in more inhospitable environments.  This would expand the area available for growing, and increase the annual yield for timber and biomass fuel.  Additionally, red alder does not require nitrogen fertilizers. It achieves this by harnessing Frankia, a microbe, to provide the nitrogen for it. The relationship between the tree and the microbe requires scientific study.  Some Frankia strains are better than others, and some combinations of tree and microbial strains are well suited to certain environments. This project seeks to understand how the red alder genetics, soil type, Frankia strain, and other bacteria in the soil interact to promote tree growth. The result will be the ability to develop new tree strains suited to certain environments, to expand planting to meet growing demand. The project includes training opportunities for students (high school through graduate level) and supports a high school summer innovation academy that targets underserved students.

In particular, the role of ongoing sensory stimulation for the normal development and maintenance of sensory systems is a perennial area of interest.  Knowledge about these processes for the sense of smell lags behind the other senses, not least because of the difficulty in physically controlling an odor stimulus. This project advances our understanding of stimulus-induced changes olfactory processing and other mechanisms of smell, as well as sheds light on the tendency of physiological systems, like olfaction, to operate in a relatively stable equilibrium between interdependent elements, the process known as homeostasis.  The olfactory periphery affords an excellent model where all components of a homeostatic system can be ascertained. Besides advancing our understanding of the sense of smell and sensory plasticity, the studies may suggest design elements for incorporation into chemical detection devices ('electronic noses') with applications in robotics, disease diagnosis, and bomb detection. Integrated with the research project is student-mentoring, participation-broadening, and public outreach through active involvement of undergraduates, including members of underrepresented groups, and the development of an exhibit at a local children's museum. These aspects of the project improve human resources in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and, via the museum, may engage thousands of school students annually. <br/><br/>This project addresses the universal problem of how our senses adjust to long-term changes in the stimulus environment. Such adaptability allows sensory systems to match the dynamic range of their receptors to the array of stimuli in the environment, which can vary dramatically in time and space. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms of these homeostasis-like processes. The Investigator and his colleagues have discovered a phenomenon in the olfactory periphery termed compensatory plasticity that has the signature of such a process. In the olfactory epithelium, odor deprivation causes an up-regulation of the transduction cascade and enhancement of physiological responses that seemingly compensate in low stimulus environments.  The previous work allowed only binary control of the odor environment (i.e., deprivation or no deprivation). In the current project, the responses of the olfactory system to odor stimulation history is examined using olfactometric methods that allow broader control of odor environments, including the type, complexity, concentration, and timing of odor exposure.  The dependent measures include transcriptomic, histological, physiological, and behavior endpoints, allowing a holistic analysis of compensatory plasticity that lays the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of this process.  Results from these studies advance our understanding of olfactory plasticity as well as illuminate mechanisms of neural plasticity and homeostasis"

High annual mortality of US honey bee colonies (averaging 33% since 2006) impacts everyone, as approximately 1/3 of the crops grown to sustain the typical Western diet rely on honey bees for pollination (including many fruit, nut, vegetable, and oil seed crops). Agriculturalists, beekeepers, citizens, and scientists are concerned about honey bee colony losses, which have been associated with virus infection, as well as other abiotic and biotic factors. Though viruses play a role in honey bee colony losses, the mechanisms important to honey bee antiviral defense remain largely uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, the Flenniken laboratory is performing experiments in individual bees and cultured cells that will determine the roles of specific honey bee encoded proteins in sensing and responding to viral pathogens. Better understanding of honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms may lead to development of strategies that mitigate virus-associated colony losses, which would in turn broadly impact agricultural and ecological systems that rely on honey bees as pollinators. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students who are performing experiments and are involved in the development and expansion of undergraduate, graduate, and community courses, that utilize honey bees as a model to explain topics in virology, genetics, and biotechnology, while underscoring the importance of pollinators in all ecosystems and the role of basic science in addressing problems of global scale, including loss of bee pollinators.  <br/><br/>All organisms have evolved mechanisms to detect and respond to pathogens. A crucial aspect of innate immune mechanisms is recognition of non-self molecules including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by replicating viruses. The RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism, which results in degradation of viral RNA in a sequence-specific manner, is the primary antiviral defense mechanism for solitary insects, including fruit flies and mosquitoes. Honey bees, which are eusocial insects that live in colonies comprised of over 40,000 individuals, utilize RNAi and a non-sequence specific dsRNA-mediated immune response. The effects of viruses at both the individual bee and colony (super-organism) levels are not well understood, though massive mortality of individual bees will result in death of the entire colony. In individual bees, virus infections can remain asymptomatic, cause paralysis, and/or result in death. These differential outcomes are largely dependent on host immune responses, yet the mechanisms of honey bee antiviral responses require further elucidation. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms of honey bee host antiviral defense. To accomplish this goal, the Flenniken laboratory is performing virus infection trials in both individual bees (in vivo) and in cultured cells (in vitro) to (1) identify the cellular sensors of dsRNA, (2) elucidate of the role of candidate honey bee antiviral defense genes, and (3) examine of the interactions between immune pathways and the mechanistic details dsRNA-mediated responses. These experiments will significantly advance the understanding of the honey bee antiviral defense network and enhance our understanding of viral pathogenicity."

M. oryzae is also emerging as a major pathogen of wheat. During rice infection, dome-shaped fungal cells called appressoria form on the surface of the rice leaf and access the underlying epidermal cells. Remarkably, fungal growth in living rice cells, called biotrophy, occurs for the first days of infection without activating the robust plant defenses that normally work to keep the host plant disease-free. Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this biotrophic growth stage to crop health, little is known about how plant defense suppression and fungal growth is integrated in host cells. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal asks: How do fungal cells thrive in rice cells? To answer this, research will be directed towards characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are impaired in their ability to colonize rice cells in order to unlock the fundamental cellular, biochemical, and genetic regulatory mechanisms that govern the rice-fungus interaction. This work could point to much needed robust and sustainable mitigation strategies and shed light on fundamental growth processes in fungi.

Plant pollination is an excellent system for gaining insight into this question because intercellular communication between male and female tissues is critical for the recognition of compatible pollen. In plants a pollen tube (PT) grows from a pollen grain that has landed on the surface of a flower's female reproductive tissue. The tube extends through that tissue towards the egg-containing ovary. Upon entering the ovary the tube stops growing and bursts open, releasing sperm that fertilize an egg, which in turn develops into a seed.  In order to deliver the sperm cells to the ovary, the PT must sense that it has arrived at the right place and change  from tip-growth to explosive release of the sperm it contains. This project seeks to determine the molecular signals that communicate to a PT that it has entered the ovary and must stop growing and release its sperm. <br/><br/>Female gametophytic mutations in FERONIA (FER), a receptor-like kinase, and NORTIA (NTA), a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of 7-transmembrane proteins, cause PTs to continue growing inside of the receptive synergid instead of rupturing to release the sperm, indicating that these genes form part of a signaling network. This project is aimed at further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms used for communication between the synergid and PT during PT reception, using NTA as the anchor molecule. Synergids are highly specialized cells whose sole function is to communicate with PTs. Experiments will be performed to define the cell biology of the synergid cells before, during and after PT reception and to determine which domains are necessary for NTA localization and function and to determine how NTA fits into the dynamic cellular changes that occur during PT reception. The second goal of the project is to identify new members of the PT reception pathway and determine how they act in the signaling pathway. Enhancer and suppressor mutants of the gene nta will be characterized for roles in PT reception and NTA will be used as bait in yeast-2-hybrid screens to identify other members of the pathway. The results of this project will provide a clearer picture of the signaling pathway involved in PT reception and may also be transformative in our understanding of how self/non-self recognition takes place.  A graduate student, post-doc, and undergraduate student will be trained in the fields of plant genetics and cell biology during this project. Students in a cell biology lab taught by the Principal Investigator will investigate proteins that are predicted to be involved in PT reception in an inquiry-based lab module and an outreach program will be conducted to encourage rural Oklahoma high schools to incorporate plant science research in their curricula."

The expression of imprinted genes depends on parent-of-origin: some are expressed exclusively from the maternal copy, and some from the paternal copy. Disruption of this unusual expression pattern in mouse placenta alters the behavior and physiology of mothers. In humans, imprinted genes are linked to mood and cognition disorders.

They do so in a tractable hybrid system, in which potentially opposing effects of LOI for paternally vs. maternally imprinted genes can be enumerated. Effects of placental LOI on mothers will be tested by profiling the behavior, neural transcriptomes (RNAseq) and hormone levels of pregnant females, and the behavior of nursing mothers. In parallel, they will measure expression (RNAseq) and DNA methylation (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) in embryonic brain and placenta, and behavior in neonates. Cross-fostering will separate effects of altered maternal care in mothers exposed to placental LOI, from effects of developmental LOI, on behavior and neural gene expression and methylation in adult animals. These studies will test the hypothesis that imprinted genes regulate the intimate and obligate relationship between mammalian mothers and young, and will advance understanding of the combined effects of genotype, epigenotype and rearing environment on brain and behavior, and the role of imprinted genes in placental signaling and in shaping the adult brain."

Prior work identified the a soluble enzyme in gills from sharks and rays as a novel molecular sensor and regulator of high blood pH. The current project will explore the putative role of this soluble enzyme in sensing and regulating low blood pH in shark gills, and will expand those studies to gills of other aquatic vertebrates, bony fishes. In addition, it will explore novel functions in red blood cells and heart muscle cells from both shark and bony fishes. Because those two cell types are greatly affected by pH, this soluble enzyme may play important roles in essential physiological processes such as oxygen uptake and delivery by red blood cells, and in contraction and heart beat rate by heart muscle cells. This project will develop biochemical, cellular, and physiological tools, many of which could be subsequently adapted to test similar hypotheses in other organisms. This information will help understand and predict how organisms respond to environmental and metabolic stress, as well as informing the management of wild and farmed populations in changing ocean conditions. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and develop onsite and online educational outreach activities for K-12 students in collaboration with SeaCamp San Diego, a local marine science camp for kids and teenagers.<br/><br/>The enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) produces the ubiquitous messenger molecule cyclic AMP in response to changes in CO2, pH and HCO3- levels. Since its discovery in 1999, sAC has been found to regulate diverse physiological processes in multiple animal phyla ranging from coral to mammals, and is therefore deemed an evolutionarily conserved acid/base sensor. The proposed research will: (1) continue research on elasmobranch gill cells to elucidate if sAC regulates acid secretion; (2) perform the initial molecular and biochemical characterization of sAC in a teleost fish (the rainbow trout); (3) explore the presence of multiple sAC splice variants in trout, and their putative differential subcellular localization; (4) characterize the putative role of sAC in trout gill cells in sensing and regulating blood acid/base status; (5) study a potential role of sAC in regulating oxygen binding in erythrocytes from shark and trout; (6) explore the role of sAC in cardiomyocytes, where it is hypothesized to regulate contractibility. To achieve those aims, a variety of experimental methods will be used including primary cell cultures, expression of GFP-tagged proteins in cultured trout fibroblasts, intracellular pH and Ca2+ measurements, erythrocyte oxygen-binding curves, sarcomere shortening, and immunocytochemistry. Given the established importance of acid/base status and cAMP on the physiology of gill cells, erythrocytes and cardiomyocytes, this research has the potential to find novel sAC-dependent mechanisms that regulate physiological functions essential to fish, and which potentially extend to other animals. The simultaneous study of elasmobranch and teleost adds a comparative and evolutionary component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, social networks must change across time; for example, all social networks eventually lose individuals through death or dispersal, and new individuals join social networks through birth and immigration. Thus, the simple and universal processes of birth, death and movement fundamentally shape the structure of social networks at any given time. A major goal of this project is to understand how demography and social behavior interact to affect the development and stability of social networks across time. The project will integrate theoretical models with long-term field research focusing on the social network of flock associations in a wintering migrant bird species, the golden-crowned sparrow. Seasonal social networks in migratory birds allows for the repeated study of the process of network formation with a mix of old and new individuals present in the population each year. As a whole, this project will pose new questions that can shed light on the processes that govern how societies take shape, and the resilience of social structure in the face of constant change, in animal populations and even in human societies. The project will integrate research goals with two different types of educational activities: development of teaching curricula on reproducible research and the recruitment of students of immigrant/refugee background to higher education and science. <br/><br/>This project proposes a general framework for understanding the temporal dynamics of social networks under population turnover. The model breaks the process into three steps: node loss, node attachment and social integration. Node loss and node attachment dynamics describe the effects of demography, while social integration captures the processes underlying the formation of new flock associations. This model will enable the study of the joint effects of demography, social processes, and fitness consequences of social position on social network structure. The field-based empirical work will explore natural long-term dynamics in social networks spanning multiple generations of a single avian species. Field experiments will be conducted to test the effects of social position on behaviors such as finding novel food sources, as well as, the effects of social relations on dominance interactions.  The educational objectives of this project will make significant contributions towards improving education and enhancing diversity in STEM. This project will enhance the capacity for reproducible research among hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students through development of new curricula. The project will also work to increase recruitment of a significantly overlooked, under-served community, i.e., refugee and immigrant populations in the Midwest. Refugees are hidden sources of diversity in Nebraska and enhancing opportunities for these students will strengthen the U.S. workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many conifer species have recently experienced extreme mortality events due to drought, fire and insect outbreaks. There is an urgent need to understand conifer physiology, and especially conifer needles - the organs responsible for carbon uptake and regulation of water loss. Conifers have an intriguing paradox in the link between their leaf anatomy and physiology: with such a simplistic, single-vein vascular system, how can they compete with broadleaf species or inhabit extreme environments? This project aims to understand how conifer leaf anatomy influences water transport and photosynthesis, and how needle water transport declines during drought. This information will then be used to develop a mechanistic model to help predict forest productivity and mortality in response to drought and other environmental challenges. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students. Also, in collaboration with the McCall Outdoor Science School, 5th and 6th grade students, their parents and teachers will participate in a workshop called ""What happens inside a leaf?"" To illustrate how cellular-level modifications can influence landscape processes, 3D-printed conifer needle models generated from X-ray imaging will be used. Anatomical models will be freely available through a website for teachers and students to 3D print hand-held models at schools, or as teaching kits for schools without access to 3D printing technology. <br/><br/>Conifers inhabit some of the driest and coldest habitats where trees are found.  Many conifer species are threatened by heat waves and droughts that induce physiological stress that can make them more vulnerable to pests and pathogens. Although most conifer leaves have only a single vein supplying water to the leaf, the internal anatomy outside the vein is incredibly diverse across the conifer phylogeny. The impact of this diversity on water transport and carbon uptake is unknown. The primary goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic framework to understand the influence of conifer leaf anatomy on leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic capacity. This mechanistic understanding will be used to illuminate how conifers have adapted to arid and cold environments and have also been able to successfully compete with angiosperm species over evolutionary history. The project will combine state-of the art 3-dimensional imaging methods (high-resolution X-ray computed micro-tomography) with a hydraulic model and measurement of leaf hydraulic conductance to clarify the impact of conifer leaf internal anatomy on hydraulic function."

This platform would enable light to be delivered to thousands of different locations in the brain and would enable stimulation of neurons with arbitrary dynamical patterns. This proposed approach is expected to  provide a critical stepping stone towards one of the greatest challenges facing science today - the understanding how the brain works. It will not only enable a new class of experiments to advance basic biological knowledge but could eventually contribute to an understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. <br/><br/>Optical stimulation and silencing of neural activity is a powerful technique for elucidating the structure and function of neural circuitry, however in most in vivo optogenetic experiments, light is delivered into the brain through a single optical fiber limiting illumination to a large, fixed volume of the brain.  A novel nanophotonic platform is proposed  to allow massively parallel, multi-site stimulation through a single waveguide. Recent advances in nanophotonics enable the proposed optical probe platform which routes input light to an arbitrary excitation spot. The proposed platform is designed to be compatible with standard silicon probes for electrophysiological recordings.  The proposed platform is based on nanowaveguides that consist of Silicon Nitride (SiN) wires with ~0.5 micrometers in diameter embedded in SiO2, that just like fibers, are transparent to light of wavelengths from the UV down to the mid-IR, and can be centimeters long. When compared to fibers, however, they are much smaller and enable light to be emitted from the nano-waveguides forming multiple beams at arbitrary locations.  A first-generation probe will be fabricated, tested and then integrated with a state of art electrical probe for neural validation. This integrated device will then be used in mouse cortex to demonstrate the ability of waveguides to provide sufficient light for ChR2 activation and selective activation across cortical layers."

Critical gaps, however, remain towards understanding how leaves initiate during the earliest stages of growth.  In this project, genes that control leaf initiation will be identified by investigating maize mutants that fail to suppress leaves after the reproductive transition.  Reproductive leaf (or bract) suppression presents a promising means to identify genes acting in the earliest stages of leaf initiation.  The project will use genome-wide techniques identify the network of genes that are regulating maize bract outgrowth.  Since bract suppression has evolved multiple times, these results should also shed light on the evolution of developmental mechanisms.  <br/><br/>In order to increase public understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, the project will develop novel curriculum and assessment materials designed identify and address misconception related to evolutionary thinking.  Specifically, an assessment that can reveal common misconceptions related to evolutionary trees will be developed, and future high school teachers will be trained to teach biological diversity from an evolutionary framework.  The ability to interpret evolutionary trees is key to biological literacy, but the necessary skills are rarely taught and often poorly understood by high school teachers.

The research aims to understand how endocannabinoid signaling by fat cells affects bone remodeling in obese, but otherwise healthy hibernating marmots.  The planned studies will provide research experiences for undergraduate students to prepare them for advanced education and careers in science. The educational outreach component of this award will help students understand how diet and exercise affect fat accumulation and overall health of organisms.

It will develop an interactive exhibit for K-12  students to explore the differences between the metabolism and physical activity of a hibernating animal and themselves.  It will develop research kits for middle school students to measure and understand the calorie content of specific foods. It will also develop a presentation on the unique physiological adaptations in hibernators to underserved K-5 students. <br/><br/>Hibernating mammals demonstrate remarkable resilience by having evolved physiological mechanisms that allow them to survive extreme physiological and environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time. Physical inactivity, obesity, and anorexia are well known to negatively impact bone metabolism and structure in non-hibernating animals.  However, the physical inactivity, obesity, and anorexia that occur during hibernation do not negatively affect bone in marmots. The research will investigate the role of the endocannabinoid system in preventing bone loss in hibernating marmots. The research will test the general hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system regulates bone metabolism during hibernation to prevent bone loss. The project will undertake an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the role of paracrine signaling from bone marrow adipocytes in endocannabinoid regulated bone metabolism during hibernation. Novel targeted mass spectrometry methodology to measure tissue levels of endocannabinoid ligands, with greater sensitivity than previously reported, will be used to measure endocannabinoid levels in marmot serum, bone, and adipose tissue. Pharmacological blocking will be used to assess the role of specific components of the endocannabinoid system in regulating bone remodeling and structure during hibernation. Additionally, the methodology and results from the study will provide the conceptual framework for modeling how the endocannabinoid system regulates metabolism in other physiological systems during the extreme conditions of hibernation."

They have a highly complex system for camouflage, enabling them to blend in with their environment instantaneously. They have an advanced ability for learning and memory. They have large brains (the common octopus has 6 times as many nerve cells as a rat). These and other innovations have evolved along an independent trajectory from the vertebrates, the only other similarly advanced group. By studying cephalopods, much can be learned regarding biological complexity; however, these studies have lagged due to the lack of a suitable cephalopod model system. Over the past 30 years, genetically tractable model organisms like the fruit fly and lab mouse have driven biological discovery. This project aims to develop the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid into the first genetically tractable cephalopod model. This species is ideal because it is small, it can be cultured through its entire lifecycle, and it reaches sexual maturity in as little as two and a half months. The project involves the establishment of a large-scale culture facility at the Marine Biological Laboratory to provide specimens for genetic manipulation. Husbandry methods are perfected to culture these organisms through multiple generations. Finally, techniques for genome editing are developed. All resources developed under this project, including animals and methods for gene knockouts, are shared with the scientific community of cephalopod enthusiasts through workshops. Additional efforts include assistance with the incorporation of cephalopod biology into educational curricula for undergraduate students, and into public outreach activities, such as exhibits at science museums. <br/><br/>As a group, the coleoid cephalopods exhibit extraordinary novelties, many that are poised to promote biological discovery across disciplines. For example, they have by far the largest brains of any invertebrate, and show behavioral sophistication comparable to advanced vertebrates. Through convergence, they have evolved camera-type eyes and the biomechanical capabilities of their appendages inspire robotic design. Conspicuous symbioses with marine microbes make some species ideal models for studying symbioses. Recently sequenced genomes and transcriptomes have uncovered molecular novelties. In octopus, for example, large-scale expansions of cell adhesion molecules may help explain how complex nervous systems are assembled. Other studies indicate that cephalopods use RNA editing at unprecedented levels to diversify genetic information. Taken together, these phenomena underscore the vast potential of cephalopods to broaden our understanding of fundamental and unexplored area in biology; however, the field has struggled to advance without a genetically tractable model. The cephalopod community has lacked a model because the husbandry of these organisms is difficult. This work overcomes a key bottleneck in cephalopod research by developing Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, into a genetically tractable model. This species is ideal because it is small, it can be cultured through its lifecycle, and it reaches sexual maturity rapidly. To accomplish the project goals, a lifecycle culture facility is established and protocols for genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 are developed. Animals produced by this facility are offered to the scientific community. Protocols for husbandry and genome editing are disseminated through workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While physiological responses to environmental variability are widely acknowledged, research is often conducted in a manner that attempts to minimize that variability. It is becoming evident however that to fully understand an organism's interaction with its environment, research approaches are needed that explore how natural variation or experiments conducted under more natural environmental regimes (e.g. daily and annual fluctuations in temperature) affects physiological mechanisms and responses to this variation. Recently, a number of investigators have turned their focus towards attempting to incorporate environmental variation into studies of physiology and behavior.  Not surprisingly these studies are finding that the results from studies that include environmental variation differ substantially from those that do not. The goal of this symposium is to highlight important insights that are gained when studies take into account these, often dramatic, changes and to stimulate future research that is needed to better understand how animals, including many economically important species, may cope with changing environments. The symposium is designed to bring together researchers working across taxa and ecosystems. This symposium will include a diverse range of researchers that span career stages from graduate student to full professor, and all speakers will disseminate these findings in a special issue of Integrative and Comparative Biology. <br/><br/>Nearly all animals experience dramatic, often predictable, changes in their environment that requires responsive changes in an individual's physiology and behavior. Yet many studies aimed at understanding evolutionary and ecological responses to an environmental or physiological variable of interest seek to control and minimize variation. Some examples include the incubation of eggs in species with environmental sex determination under continuous temperatures through the duration of incubation, or hormone implants aimed at maintaining relatively constant circulating levels for an extended period of time. Whether conducted in the laboratory or the field, these studies have provided critical information about the mechanistic relationships that influence physiology and behavior that, in turn, influence variation in individual fitness, despite providing limited information on the direct effects of environmental variation. Understanding why and how animals cope with environmental changes is key to recognizing the sources and subsequent responses that give rise to the variation that selection can act upon. This symposium draws on longstanding questions in comparative physiology (e.g., how do animals cope with environmental variability?), but approaches those questions from a modern perspective. The group of speakers represent a diverse group of scientists. In addition to the main symposium, a contributed session will be advertised that will specifically target student trainees, and efforts will be made to reach out to underrepresented groups through announcements in organizations such as the Society for Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rise of atmospheric oxygen led to life as we know it today, including organisms that breath oxygen and multicellular life such as plants and animals. This event is principally related to the evolution of oxygen (O2) producing photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria. Photosystem II (PSII) is the catalyst that uses light energy to remove electrons from water and produce O2. The evolutionary route of PSII to produce O2 is uncertain. One hypothesis, based on both the geological record and biochemical studies of PSII, is a precursor photosystem was able to obtain electrons from the transition metal manganese, instead of water. The proposed work tests this hypothesis using modern Cyanobacteria and PSII, which may still be able to perform this reaction. The work will help scientists understand the evolution of this important process: the production of O2. It will also impact understanding of modern manganese cycling on our planet, which affects the fate of many pollutants in the environment. Students trained in this interdisciplinary research project from both a geobiology program at a research intensive university and a biological science program at a diverse regional Hispanic-serving primarily undergraduate institution will attend common group and professional meetings and develop mentor-mentee relationships across disciplines. Findings will also be integrated into presentations and coursework at K-12 and the two universities. <br/><br/><br/>This project concerns the hypothesis that the ""missing link"" in the evolution of photosynthetic water-oxidation by Photosystem II (PSII) was phototrophic Mn(II) oxidation, and examines Mn phototrophy in Cyanobacteria to test this hypothesis. High-valent manganese species comprise a critical pool of strong oxidants in the environment, involved in the cycling of both carbon and metals. This work will add to the understanding of modern biological Mn oxidation and the potential sources of high-valent Mn in nature by examining bacterial Mn oxidation in Mn phototrophy. Phototrophic Mn oxidation will be evaluated and linked to growth using whole cells of the genetically tractable Cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp.

These studies have the potential to provide new insight into our understanding of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

Changes in calcium concentration are used to convey diverse types of information within cells (intracellular calcium signaling). The particular physiological outputs of calcium signaling cascades are exquisitely dependent upon spatial and temporal constraints. A variety of proteins help to shape calcium signals, and in mammals this regulation can be extremely complex. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism that is widely used for genetic approaches and exhibits many of the same constraints on calcium signaling as mammals. The use of this model allows researchers to circumvent the complexities of mammalian systems and more directly show cause and effect through advanced genomic editing approaches and integrative physiology. Specifically, this project will investigate how the interaction between two classes of proteins that are central to calcium signaling regulates physiological and behavioral outputs. The Nehrke Lab is strongly committed to promoting community interactions and diversity in science and to training the next generation of scientists. Toward these ends, the project will continue to provide STEM education to Rochester City School District third-graders through an outreach program at the YMCA and will initiate a joint training program with Monroe Community College that allows students to rotate among a variety of University of Rochester Medical Center laboratories during the academic year and then to undertake a ten-week summer research fellowship in one of those labs.<br/><br/>The inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is an endoplasmic reticular (ER) Ca2+ release channel whose activity is central to Ca2+ signaling. Fine-tuning of IP3R activity by other proteins diversifies its signaling repertoire. Recent evidence indicates that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members interact with the IP3R and that this may facilitate ER-to-mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer to promote oscillatory Ca2+ signaling rather than apoptotic Ca2+ overload. In mammals, studying the role of IP3R/Bcl-2 interactions is complicated by multiple IP3R isoforms and Bcl-2 family members that share contact sites with the receptor, making it difficult to address specific cause and effect. In contrast, C. elegans has only a single isoform of each protein, which nevertheless perform similar functions and possess nearly identical amino acid sequences to their mammalian counterparts at the sites of interaction. Sophisticated genetic tools, including CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to create ""loss-of-interaction"" models and cutting-edge approaches using biosensors to measure localized calcium signaling, will be used to test this hypothesis and to interrogate the underlying mechanisms. Research results will increase understanding of inter-organelle communication and its relevance to normal physiology.

The work focuses on circuits in the spinal cord of zebrafish embryos, which develop early in life and are simpler and more experimentally-tractable than neural circuits in the brain. The goal is to identify key regulatory genes that instruct cells to grow into one particular population of nerve cells (interneurons) with specific functions in controlling precise body movements. The outcomes of this project will be widely applicable, because these types of nerve cell exist in all vertebrates (including humans). The genes identified in this study and the ways that they influence nerve cell and circuit development are likely to be similar in many different species. This project will significantly increase understanding of how genes instruct cells to develop with particular characteristics, and the roles that specific genes play in the construction of neuronal circuitry. The principal investigators will incorporate this research into their university teaching and presentations made to the general public. This research will contribute to the diversification of the scientific workforce through the active participation of both women and under-represented minorities. The principal investigators will also perform outreach to local city high schools and develop teaching modules for both 9th/10th grade and advanced placement high school Biology students. The aim of these activities is to significantly impact the lives of traditionally under-served high school students and enthuse under represented minority high school students about science and research.<br/><br/>An essential first step in understanding how neuronal networks are generated is determining how distinct interneurons (INs) are specified with particular functional properties. One key property that helps to define INs is which neurotransmitter they use to communicate with other cells. Neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory and INs utilizing inappropriate neurotransmitters form malfunctioning circuits. Therefore, determining how IN neurotransmitter properties are specified is crucial for understanding both IN and circuit development. Relatively little is known about how excitatory spinal IN properties are specified. This proposal will characterize a gene regulatory network (GRN) that specifies spinal IN excitatory properties, using zebrafish as a model system. The investigators have identified genes that encode for 11 different DNA-binding proteins as candidate members of a GRN that specifies V0v IN excitatory (glutamatergic) properties. V0v INs reside in the middle of the spinal cord and have crucial roles in locomotor circuitry. The research team has already shown that four of these genes, evx1/2 and lmx1ba/b are required for correct excitatory fates of V0v INs. In addition, in evx1/2 double mutants V0v INs lose expression of both lmx1ba/b and the other 7 genes, suggesting that all 9 of these genes may act downstream of Evx1/2 in specifying V0v glutamatergic properties. The specific objectives of this proposal are to test if any of these 7 other genes are required for correct V0v neurotransmitter properties and determine the epistatic relationships among all of these Evx1/2-regulated genes. Single and compound zebrafish mutants will be used to answer these questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on Reelin, a large molecule that critically controls the embryonic formation of brain structures that contain different cell types organized into layers. Reelin also affects brain development after birth by promoting the maturation of cells, and the formation of connections that nerve cells make with each other (called synapses). Finally, in the adult and in old-aged brains, Reelin modulates the transmission of information at synapses, influencing cognitive brain function. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these diverse biological functions of Reelin are not well understood. The purpose of the present project is to address this knowledge gap by advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which Reelin affects mammalian brain development and function. The knowledge and materials generated by this study, including novel purified protein reagents and structural models, will be made available to the broad research community, accelerating the rate of discovery and promoting new scientific advances. This work will also benefit society by providing research training for undergraduate and graduate students, including women and other groups of people who are currently under-represented in science, fostering the development of a more diverse and globally competitive S.T.E.M. workforce.<br/><br/>Reelin is a large, modular secreted glycoprotein that controls many aspects of brain development and function, from neuronal migration at embryonic ages, to dendrite development, synapse formation, plasticity, and learning at postnatal ages. The mechanisms that mediate these biological functions are not well understood. A major obstacle that hindered progress in the field is the lack of availability of purified Reelin. This stems not only from the difficulty of expressing such a large glycoprotein, but also from the challenges associated with proteolytic cleavage events, which generate multiple protein isoforms. Through collaborative efforts and the establishment of novel protocols, the present research team was able to overcome this limitation, and has obtained large amounts of highly-purified, bioactive Reelin protein. The goals of the project are to: 1) characterize the three-dimensional structure of Reelin proteins by Cryo- Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET), protein crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering; 2) ; identify and characterize novel receptor(s) by a combination of biochemical and proteomic technologies such as  ELISA and mass spectrometry; 3) and identify signal transduction mechanisms that are elicited by these new receptors in distinct neuronal populations, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astroglia. Together, these experiments will either validate or rule out the main hypothesis guiding the work, that full-length Reelin and its physiological proteolytic fragments are bioactive ligands that affect brain development and function by engaging a variety of cell-surface receptors expressed by different cell types, and activating multiple signal transduction pathways. The approach followed here with Reelin may also provide a paradigm for gaining a deeper understand of other molecules that play a variety of roles in the brain from early development through adulthood and senescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the western US, tree death from drought, high temperatures, and bark beetle outbreaks now exceeds forest growth. Despite increases in the frequency and severity of drought-related insect outbreaks, factors influencing a tree's susceptibility to insect herbivores, such as the presence of chemical defenses, have received little attention. In particular, it is unclear how drought causes trees to shift resources toward or away from the chemical defenses that deter insect attacks and the subsequent trade-offs that exist with other important plant functions. To address this critical knowledge gap, this study focuses on how pinon pine trees allocate their carbon resources toward defense and other physiological processes under increasing drought stress to avoid death by drought or bark beetle attack. This study uses an isotope labeling approach in both greenhouse and field experiments to track drought-induced changes in carbon allocation to specific chemical compounds that affect bark beetle choice and success. The project increases participation of Native American students through undergraduate recruitment for summer research assistantships as well as other underrepresented minorities in science through the development of two critical thinking modules and support for their adoption in rural middle school classrooms across Montana. <br/><br/>The rate of tree mortality has increased across the globe yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying tree death remains surprisingly limited. Most work to date on drought-related tree death has focused on understanding the coupled roles of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure, but drought is oftentimes accompanied by insect outbreaks that cause or contribute to tree mortality. Research has yet to determine when trees cease investment in effective chemical defenses against biotic attack along the continuum of drought stress, and how these shifts in carbon availability simultaneously impact other plant physiological processes. This study seeks a mechanistic understanding of how drought stress affects the interactions among tree hydraulic function, carbohydrate availability, and chemical defense. Using both greenhouse experiments and field drought manipulations this research will couple enzyme assays with the use of stable isotopes to identify mechanisms responsible for shifts in pinon pine allocation of recently fixed carbon at the level of individual compounds with known impacts on bark beetle behavior. These methods will also allow identification of trade-offs involved in the synthesis of defense compounds at different drought severities while also advancing fundamental understanding of tree physiology and whole tree C budgets. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of drought-induced physiological stress on mechanisms determining defense against bark beetles, a new, more complete framework for assessing mechanisms of tree mortality will be developed.

Many different molecules affect the patterning of the embryonic nervous system; these molecules have been used to identify biochemical pathways that are part of the developmental programs cells utilize to acquire their individual neuronal identities. However, the extent to which the environment intervenes in the functioning of this developmental program, is an understudied aspect of neural development. This research project documents ways in which nervous system development is dynamic and sensitive to the environment in which it occurs, challenging the idea of a predetermined, rigid genetic program that completely dictates the fate of neural cells before they are born. A mechanistic explanation for the observed plastic changes (that the environmental plasticity produces neural circuits that better match an individual's performance to the particular environment they develop in) is also tested. The research will assess the influence of temperature on neuronal differentiation in the embryonic frog spinal cord, and chart the mechanisms through which temperature differences change the sensorimotor behavior of developing tadpoles. Understanding these basic mechanisms of nervous system development will benefit society by contributing to knowledge about neurodevelopmental disorders and spinal cord regeneration. In addition, this project will establish an educational program at the K-12 school in Shriners Hospital for Children Northern California. Children are patients, mostly from low-income families; they will be offered a school program when they need to stay long-term at the Hospital, a non-profit organization that cares for the children at no cost. The project will expose these children to hands-on science activities and the scientific method. <br/><br/>This investigation hypothesizes that environmental cues modulate embryonic calcium activity in developing neurons, thus regulating spinal neuron differentiation and the establishment of effective locomotor circuitry. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this study will identify the mechanisms by which environmental temperature modulates calcium-mediated spontaneous electrical activity resulting in specification of developing spinal neurons. The study hypothesizes that the cold-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel M8 (TRPM8) contributes to the higher frequency calcium spike activity observed at cold temperatures. Pharmacological and genetic approaches will be implemented to assess the necessity and sufficiency of TRPM8 in cold temperature-induced changes in calcium activity. Differentiation and patterns of connectivity of sensory and motor neuron populations in animals grown at different temperatures after reaching identical tadpole stages will be examined by immunostaining and luciferase assay reporters. This investigation will determine the mechanisms underlying the changes in sensory and motor neuron differentiation by rescuing the temperature-driven phenotype through imposing counteracting approaches to the changes in calcium spike activity. To determine the consequences of the temperature-driven changes in neuronal differentiation on sensorimotor behavior and to test whether there is interaction between the temperature at which animals are grown and the sensorimotor performance, embryos will be raised at different temperatures until tadpole stages when the flexion reflex and the swimming pattern will be assessed at different temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photosynthesis works well when plants are not exposed to environmental stress, but when plants are too hot, or drought stressed, this process becomes inefficient. Plants have evolved two main alternative photosynthetic pathways in response to environmental stresses, CAM and C4 photosynthesis. C4 and CAM have each evolved many times, and it has been thought that C4 evolved in response to hot temperatures and CAM in response to drought. Similarly, these two pathways were assumed to be incompatible at cellular and genetic levels. However, a C4-CAM plant has been discovered: Portulaca, which performs C4 photosynthesis normally, but performs CAM under drought. This project aims to understand the function and ecological significance of a C4-CAM photosynthetic system. The research team will discover how many times C4-CAM evolved in Portulaca, and will identify the spatial configuration of both pathways within the leaf. They will identify the genes that regulate both pathways, and will compare the ecological ranges of C4-CAM species with relatives that do not have this trait. Finally, they will survey other plants to identify additional origins of this novel photosynthesis type. This research may contribute to crop improvement- for example, efforts to engineer C4 into rice, and CAM into poplar. A C4-CAM crop could be highly productive when water is prevalent, but drought-resistant when water is scarce. In addition, this award will support a broad range of educational activities, including post-doctoral and graduate student training, undergraduate research, and high school teacher training and curriculum development.<br/><br/>C4 and CAM photosynthesis are two metabolic pathways that have evolved multiple times. Though biochemically similar, each pathway requires a unique suite of anatomical characters in order to work efficiently, and conventional wisdom holds that these characters are antagonistic, such that anatomy that facilitates efficient C4 will simultaneously disadvantage a CAM metabolism. This widely accepted view cannot, however, accommodate Portulaca, the only plants currently known to operate both C4 and CAM cycles within a single leaf. Recent work suggests that ancestral Portulaca was a facultative CAM plant, and evolved a C4 system while maintaining CAM capability at least three times. The proposed research will test this hypothesis and develop Portulaca as a model lineage for investigating the evolutionary connectivity of C4 and CAM pathways. This project aims to: 1) confirm the existence of facultative CAM in all major Portulaca lineages, and characterize CAM and C4 biochemical cycles and differential gene expression in 7 species representing all C4 origins; 2) identify the spatial configuration of C4 and CAM cycles within the leaf, using in situ hybridization and protein immunolocalization; 3) utilize recently designed targeted gene enrichment baits (HybSeq) to sequence key photosynthetic (and other) genes from across Portulaca to improve phylogenetic resolution and analyze convergent molecular adaptation across the group; 4) characterize and contrast the climatic envelopes occupied by C4-CAM Portulaca and C3-CAM related lineages; and 5) initiate phylogenetically-informed physiological surveys to discover additional C4-CAM plants in other clades.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded in the Biology Directorate of NSF by Integrative Ecological Physiology in the Integrative Organismal Systems Division, Systematics and Biodiversity Science in the Division of Environmental Biology, and Emerging Frontiers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite decades of research, describing plant water movement remains a formidable scientific challenge, and in the absence of this fundamental knowledge, sustainable management of forests will be impossible. All type of plants, including hardwoods and coniferous trees, have core bundles of vascular tissue inside their stems. These circulatory vascular bundles are composed of hollow conduits known as xylem, or wood, that are specialized to transport water efficiently while allowing maximum resistance to drought (hydraulic safety). Sufficient water transport in plants is not guaranteed when water demand increases during hot and dry days. Under those conditions, water in wood becomes highly unstable and trees can die once an air bubble enters and spreads inside those hollow cells. By integrating modelling activities with visual and physiological processes related to air entry and air bubble formation in wood, plant water transport and resistance to drought will be established. The primary impacts of the proposed project will be to advance discovery in the field of water relations and hydraulic architecture of vascular plants by predicting tree mortality following drought, while promoting training for the next generation of scientists and educators. Results from this research can be directly used in future predictions of vegetation responses to climate. The findings here will also be of interest to policy makers, plant breeders and land managers concerned with potential drought impacts on productivity and distributions of certain species.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to link the dynamics of embolism formation and removal under tension in xylem of woody plants starting from the bubble scale and integrating the resulting dynamics along individual conduits to arrive at whole-plant vulnerability to cavitation curves. The specific objectives are to 1) measure and model the timescale required for the gas phase induced by cavitation to fully embolize an entire xylem conduit; 2) investigate the conditions under which bubble formation can spread from one conduit to another; 3) investigate the possibility of bubble resorption under tension to occur; and 4) determine the relation between embolism formation and loss of hydraulic conductivity. To achieve the project objectives, a series of science questions will be addressed: Research question 1 (bubble scale): what are the mechanisms and dynamics of embolism formation and removal in a single xylem conduit? What is the time required for a gas bubble to completely fill and to drain a conduit for varying conduit structures and xylem tensions? Research question 2 (conduit connectivity): Is the time needed for the embolism to fill a conduit dependent on conduit size, and the rigidity of the end-wall pit membrane? Research question 3 (Up-scaling to whole-plant): Do the dynamics of bubble formation in a single conduit explain the whole organ vulnerability to embolism curves. The formulation of bubble formation and spread in transpiring plants will represent a major step forward as the theoretical computational methods, and experimental techniques are now ripe for making this progress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This widespread body plan, whether in groups like insects or fish, has been highly successful during the course of evolution. Having a segmented body requires a means of producing repeated segments during the early life stages in which the body plan develops. Recent work has shown that very different types of animals may all use some kind of genetic clock that translates temporally repeated oscillations into spatially repeated segments. The best known ""segmentation clock"" is from studies in vertebrate animals. But if, and how, such a clock operates in the most diverse group of animals on earth, the arthropods, remains relatively understudied. This project focuses on one arthropod, the flour beetle, and explores the genes driving its ""segmentation clock"". This focus arises from previous work showing that the clock changes the rate at which it makes segments midway through development. Ultimately understanding how segmented bodies are built can provide insight into how problems arise along the body axis during human development. This work is a collaborative effort that links undergraduates from a teaching college to scientists at a research university, leveraging the resources of the university. Increasing the exposure of undergraduates at the teaching college to both different and more varied research technologies increases their training and preparation for careers in science.<br/><br/>Animals built from repeated segments are found in three major taxa. Vertebrates use a ""clock""-like mechanism to sequentially pattern their segments. Recently the first unequivocal segmentation clock has been demonstrated in an arthropod: the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The current model of the Tribolium clock differs in intriguing ways from the better-known vertebrate models. This project focuses on three key features of the Tribolium clock. First, the Tribolium clock begins patterning before the cell movements of gastrulation, raising the question of how clock outputs are maintained during extensive cell movements. Second, previous research showed that both the clock frequency and cell motility change between early and late segmentation. How are these changes regulated and mutually coordinated? Third, no intercellular signaling pathways have been identified to coordinate the clock between cells, a result supported by a preliminary computational model. Can the clock function cell-autonomously?  This research aims to examine the Tribolium segmentation clock by generating a comprehensive fate map of the blastoderm, and determining the stability in expression of clock regulators during the early transition of gastrulation. It also aims to uncover novel molecular regulators through different phases of the clock, by combining classical promoter dissection with bioinformatics and high-throughput genomics approaches."

Sound localization for fish plays important roles in prey detection, predator avoidance, and intraspecific communication. Although terrestrial animals use interaural time delays to localize sound, the faster speed of sound underwater, combined with very short interaural distances suggests that fish must utilize alternative mechanisms. The role of the mechanosensory lateral line in detecting water movement has been established, however, recent evidence suggest that it may serve an auditory role. The widely spaced neuromasts are distributed throughout the head and trunk in different orientations and could potentially assist in nearfield sound detection and localization. The researchers will investigate acoustic sensitivity in the lateral line in the toadfish to determine if it contributes to sound localization. Toadfish are reliable neuroethological models for bioacoustic studies as males will acoustically attract females to nesting sites. The broad head of the oyster toadfish contains widely spaced and easily accessible neuromasts and cranial nerves. The neural telemetry tag will allow examination of multimodal sensory integration by simultaneously recording from both the lateral line and otoliths during sound localization experiments in free swimming fish.

Broad interest in these epidermal ""biofactories"" is heightened by the fact that many gland-derived substances are useful for industrial and medicinal purposes. Although significant progress has been made in cataloging the metabolic ""parts list"" of glandular trichomes, fundamental questions concerning the regulation of metabolism within, and development of, the trichome structure remain to be answered. In keeping with the analogy of the trichome gland as a biochemical factory, this project seeks to address two major questions concerning the operating principles of this highly evolved structure: how are various assembly lines (metabolic pathways) within the factory coordinated, and how do changes in the demand for the assembled products (bioactive compounds) influence the way in which the factory is constructed? The research has potential to transform current views of metabolism by advancing the concept of cross regulation between seemingly disparate metabolic pathways, and defining new roles for well characterized enzymes. <br/><br/>Glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of bioactive compounds that protect aerial plant tissues from biotic and abiotic stress. The metabolic activity of trichome glands is often dominated by the production of terpenoids and flavonoids, which comprise two of the most diverse and economically important classes of compounds in nature. Progress in elucidating biosynthetic pathways for these and other secondary metabolites has far outpaced efforts to understand the developmental cell types and structures that are often key to the biological function of defense chemicals. This research project builds on recent studies showing that terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of tomato is coupled to gland development and, intriguingly, is coordinately impacted by the action of the flavonoid biosynthesis enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI). The broad objective of the project is to combine experimental and mathematical modeling approaches to achieve a systems-level understanding of how trichome metabolic and developmental processes are integrated. The experimental approaches are grounded in the use of purified trichome glands (a single cell type) for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, as well as powerful genetic tools to manipulate functional processes affecting gland development and metabolism. The research may also reveal new roles for a well-studied metabolic enzyme (CHI) and broaden current views of how small molecules control metabolism. The project provides multi-disciplinary training opportunities for trainees from diverse backgrounds, including participation of undergraduate students in the Plant Genomics REU Summer Research Program. The project will increase access by diverse segments of the public to science through partnerships with the MSU Horticulture Gardens and local industry.

The tropical amblypygid, a scorpion-like animal, is able to find its way home at night over distances exceeding 10 meters through dense, tropical forest understory.  The study of how different types of sensory information (visual, chemical, tactile) are processed by amblypygids as they solve navigation problems can reveal fundamental design properties of simple nervous systems that are somehow capable of controlling complex, learned behavior. These design properties can inspire engineering solutions applicable to robotic and artificial intelligence systems. The study of charismatic tropical amblypygids also serves as an alluring gateway for teachers to introduce K-12 students to the importance of neuroscience for understanding how organisms acquire and process information from their environment and how this information influences learning, memory and associated behavior. To support engagement with K-12 students, their teachers and the general public, researchers will, among other activities, develop internet-based educational materials in both English and Spanish and develop various scientific inquiry activities for science events. <br/><br/>By conducting behavioral experiments that assess amblypygid (Phrynus pseudoparvulus) movements after they are displaced from a home refuge, researchers will assess the relative importance of visual, chemical and mechanical information in supporting navigation. These experiments will either involve manipulation of animal sense organs or the sensory cues in their environment. The neurobiological work will focus on a brain area known as the ""mushroom bodies"", which are thought to support spatial memory. In parallel with the behavioral work, researchers will explore the nervous system routes by which information from different sensory stimuli is sent to the mushroom bodies. Particular attention will be given to how the mushroom bodies ""engineer"" or ""integrate"" the different sensory inputs.  The integration of sensory inputs is hypothesized to be necessary to support complex navigation and will likely be crucial for the design of any sophisticated artificial system. Finally, the importance of the mushroom bodies in navigation, and their capacity to combine different sources of sensory information, will be tested under the same conditions of the behavioral experiments noted above, except using animals whose mushroom bodies are impaired."

Fungal decomposition of wood is a critical component of the carbon cycle, impacts soil productivity, and has the potential to be exploited in the production of biofuels and other 'green' technologies. The major wood-decaying fungi are mushroom-forming (Agaricomycetes). The physical characteristics and chemical composition of wood vary among plant species, and most wood-decaying Agaricomycetes have characteristic wood substrate ranges. However, it is not understood why individual species of wood decaying fungi tend to occur on specific plant hosts. This project will investigate the mechanisms of substrate specificity and substrate switching in wood-decaying Agaricomycetes using a combination of analyses of genes expressed during decay, and physical and chemical characterization of the decay process. Fungal enzymes that are involved in wood decay or degradation have potential applications in emerging bioprocesses, such as energy-related bioconversions, including biofuel production, and bioremediation. Enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that allow different species of fungi to exploit particular wood substrates could help guide development of genetic resources that could be used for such applied purposes. This project will support one Postdoctoral Fellow and two graduate students, and will provide training to undergraduates at three collaborating academic institutions in the US. To bring information about fungi and wood decomposition to a wide audience, this project will create interactive exhibits and develop accompanying public programs at the Worcester EcoTarium (http://www.ecotarium.org/), a science and nature museum which serves over 140,000 visitors annually including large numbers of students from regional public schools. Exhibits will illustrate fungal diversity, the decay process, and the role of fungi in the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on four species of Agaricomycetes (with distinct substrate preferences) with available genome sequences. The fungi will be cultured on solid wafers of four different tree species (two conifers and two hardwoods). Transcriptome profiling will be performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, focusing on genes encoding enzymes known or suspected to be involved in wood decay, as well as co-expressed genes of unknown function. Phylogenomic analyses will make use of all available genomes of wood-decaying Agaricomycetes, focusing on gene families that are likely to play a role in decay, as informed by expression profiles. Physical and chemical characteristics of decay will be addressed using microscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical analyses of colonized substrates. The proposed research is a collaboration between researchers with expertise in fungal systematics and molecular evolution, wood decay and forest products pathology, fungal genomics, and genetics and biochemistry of decay systems. This project will capitalize on recent advances in genomics of wood-decaying basidiomycetes. It will provide insight into the functioning and evolution of fungi in forest ecosystems, and create a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the specific plant-derived compounds that affect expression of particular fungal genes."

The research team from the University of Puerto Rico, George Washington University, and Cornell University will investigate the gene changes underlying distribution of pigmentation across the wing surface among a variety of butterfly species.

The research team will specifically focus on characterizing the regulatory mechanisms underlying the repeated role of the signaling ligand WntA in wing pattern evolution. This work will address how the modulation of WntA spatial expression has tinkered with the micro- and macroevolution of distinct wing phenotypes across 65 million years. We will specifically aim to address the following questions: (1) How many regulatory elements at a single gene control wing pattern variation, and what are the function of individual elements? (2) Do the same elements also control the convergent evolution of mimetic phenotypes in unrelated species? (3) To what extent are wing pattern CREs conserved versus novel across species with highly divergent wing patterns? Answering these questions will help set a precedent for understanding deeper phylogenetic patterns in the relationship between the evolution of CREs and the traits they define. Finally, this research project will synergize with educational opportunities spanning pre-college, undergraduate, and post-graduate levels of science education.

The proposed research will study what social and environmental factors cause unrelated male marine fish to either cooperate or compete with one another. This research will also identify the genes, brain regions and hormones that control these behaviors - currently, there is little specific information on these mechanisms - and measure how cooperative versus competitive interactions affect reproduction in this species. Understanding what shapes cooperation, competition and conflict is not only of general interest, but can also inform conservation and management because negative interactions such as conflict and competition have been shown to increase a species risk of extinction. This project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students on a variety of biological methods including field research on marine fish and tools for understanding the genes underlying social behavior. The professors and students involved in this research will also offer internships to high school students, education outreach lectures and online activities aimed at women and girls interested in science fields and careers.

To address these aims, we propose research on wild-living ocellated wrasse (a marine fish, Symphodus ocellatus). Ocellated wrasse males exhibit three alternative reproductive types: 'nesting males' provide parental care, defend territories, and form cooperative associations with unrelated 'satellites', who cheat by sneaking fertilizations but help by reducing reproductive competition from 'sneakers' (who do not cooperate or provide care; Stiver & Alonzo 2013). We adopt an integrative approach that allows us to examine the reproductive fitness consequences of variation in cooperation and competition and identify neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying this variation and behavioral plasticity."

The objectives of this proposal are addressed through two specific aims. Aim 1: Fully characterize loci that are important for Place learning and memory. Aim 2: Determine whether specific genetic loci that impact Place learning and memory also influence Olfactory learning and memory. To achieve these aims, a newly developed high-resolution quantitative genetic panel is applied to a set of behavioral problems that have traditionally been examined separately and with different approaches. Different from previous work, this program examines learning and memory in both classical and operant conditioning paradigms to test the hypothesis that there are common core natural genetic variants that influence learning and memory in general. By identifying and validating key genetic variants that influence place and olfactory learning and memory, the proposed experiments significantly improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of learning and memory in natural populations.

Many cells have therefore evolved sophisticated rapid-response mechanisms that allow them to adapt to new environments. One such mechanism is post-translational modification of proteins, where the attachment or removal of small molecules to proteins after their initial formation allows for rapid and reversible regulation of protein activity. One type of protein modification, by the small 2-carbon acetyl unit (acetylation) has long been known to play a role in regulating which genes are expressed under different conditions. However, the surprising discovery of thousands of acetylated proteins in diverse organisms suggests a much broader role. The overall goal of this project is to understand how protein acetylation regulates stress defense in yeast. The project will identify which yeast proteins are modified by acetylation during the response to elevated temperatures, the enzymes responsible for those modifications, and how acetylation impacts protein function. In addition to addressing a fundamental knowledge gap, this project will provide broad scientific training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Undergraduates will include summer interns recruited through the George Washington Carver Research Program, which serves underrepresented students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Additionally, the project team will partner with a small local fermentation business to design a new Microbial Fermentation Laboratory course. The course will introduce students to the science behind fermentation, while lab exercises will provide hands-on experience in fermentation microbiology and biotechnology. <br/><br/>The heat shock response is a universal mechanism for dealing with stress, and has been well studied in yeast and other model organisms. The proposed work will reveal novel and previously unexplored roles for protein acetylation in the heat shock response. Specifically, quantitative acetyl-proteomics will be used on yeast cells responding to heat stress over time to identify which proteins change in acetylation state, which sites are differentially acetylated, and the stoichiometry of acetylation. To implicate the enzymes responsible for protein acetylation changes during heat stress, acetyl-proteomics will be performed on acetyltransferase and deacetylase mutants. To gain fundamental insight into how acetylation affects protein function, the focus will be on the acetylation of stress-responsive transcription factors for detailed mechanistic characterization. Transcriptional profiling and network analysis will be used to connect the timing of changes in acetylation of transcription factors during heat stress with the timing of gene expression changes for those transcription factors? targets. Multiple genetic approaches will be used to probe the in vivo effects of transcription factor acetylation on protein function. To corroborate the in vivo findings, fully acetylated and fully unacetylated transcription factors will be purified to test the effects of acetylation in vitro. In addition to providing new insights into regulation of the yeast heat shock response, results from the proposed experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies exploring how acetylation impacts other stress responses, how acetylation changes are regulated under diverse conditions, and whether these regulatory phenomena are conserved in other diverse organisms."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called ""Faces and Voices of Science"" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds.

One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

However, it is unknown what causes some babies to babble more or differently than others in the first place. This project uses an animal model to examine one popular, yet un-tested, hypothesis that the quantity and quality of playmates stimulates cognitive development as displayed by more robust vocal babbling. Early social environment can have dramatic and lasting effects on behavior in highly intelligent animals, but most models of language learning have focused on adult-juvenile interactions; occur in captive or laboratory settings; suffer from small sample sizes; or lack crucial experimental evidence. Capitalizing on a long-term, pedigreed population of wild parrots, this project manipulates the number of sibling nest mates to examine later effects on vocal babbling. Research will also investigate how social play and stress hormones impact learning.  Parrots are good models to examine social influences on language learning because they have the most sophisticated vocal imitative abilities of non-humans, they have long-term pair bonds, and an elaborate and elongated period of juvenile play. Results will provide a firmer foundation for exploring potential pathways involved in early human cognitive and vocal development.  The project is based at a minority serving institution in an economically disadvantaged region of the U.S. long underrepresented in science and math and will provide hands-on scientific training to a large number of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Songbirds have been the main model for research on the neurobiology and neuroendocrinology of vocal imitation. However, song differs from human spoken language in that the former is often restricted to males who learn during a brief sensitive phase in development, a masculinization process in the brain strongly influenced by gonadal steroids; later in adulthood, song is activated by the same androgenic steroids. In humans and parrots, individuals of both sexes use complex lingual articulation of sounds to learn new vocalizations throughout life, but little is known about how the endocrine system mediates vocal learning in both sexes. While a role for sex steroids cannot be ruled-out, stress steroids such as corticosterone tend to be more sex-neutral and can have a profound influence on neural substrates during early development. Work will: 1) quantify individual variation in the spectrographic structure of nestling vocal babbling as a function of brood size and hatching sequence; 2) quantify metrics of social networks and how these relate to patterns in 1; 3) measure adrenocortical responsiveness and any correlations with 1-2; 4) experiment through brood size and corticosterone manipulations to establish causal explanations for patterns found in 1-3; and 5) use path analysis to delineate developmental steps. Given the large variation in brood size (4-11 nestlings), this presents a unique opportunity to test if sibling social interactions foster learning processes indirectly, or directly through provisioning of vocal templates to younger siblings. Either scenario would represent novel learning strategies in birds and transform our view of early psychological development.  Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed national and international journals and presentations at national and international meetings.  Both undergraduate and graduate student research support is provided as well as international researcher involvement."

This process of long-term improvement in movement accuracy is known as skill acquisition, and is presumably driven by coordinated changes in our brain's neural representation of the movement.  Yet despite the bedrock importance of skill learning in our daily lives, the link between neural reorganization and skill acquisition is still largely unknown. This CAREER proposal lays the foundation for a long-term integrated research and educational program that will discover the links between cortical reorganization and skill acquisition and determine the behavioral factors that drive skill learning.  An improved understanding of the science behind skill learning will have long-term impact on our clinical understanding of the progression of various motor control disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and stroke, and may inform the design of targeted rehabilitation paradigms and brain-computer interface systems for those patient groups.  <br/><br/>Learning is a fundamental principle of brain operation that impacts every aspect of neural function.  Long-term practice has been accompanied by a reorganization of cortical activity in a number of brain areas, but it is typically only imaged at the level of millions of neurons. The research proposed here will explicitly probe how changes in the properties of individual neurons are linked to skill acquisition.  To accomplish this goal, this proposal leverages a brain-computer interface (BCI) skill learning task that enables precise investigation into the links between neural activity and behavioral improvement. With a BCI, it is possible to create a mapping between the activity of neurons and the movement of a computer cursor. To achieve dexterous control of the cursor, BCI subjects must practice with a particular neuron-to-cursor mapping to learn how to structure their neural activity to achieve desired movements.  We will train Rhesus macaques to operate BCIs and give them new skills to master by presenting them with new BCI mappings.  We will then track the reorganization in neural activity that occurs over days and weeks as they gain skilled control of the device. Critically, these mappings will be tailored to test various hypotheses about the behavioral drivers (i.e., visuomotor error, visuomotor bias, and movement efficiency) of cortical reorganization. The results of this study will thus provide an unparalleled view into the neural instantiation of skill development over its entire time course."

Some animals fail at apparently simple tasks, while others have a remarkable capacity to learn difficult tasks, recall complex information, and solve complex problems. It is suggested that animals need to be smart in order to manage relationships within social groups. Consistent with this idea, animals that live in complex social groups, like we see in humans, are typically smarter than non-social animals. Although comparing mental abilities across many types of animals has provided important information about the factors that influence animal intelligence, results from large comparative analyses are rarely definitive or easy to interpret. This project will take a new, experimental approach to understanding the causes and consequences of within species variation in animal intelligence. Using a wasp species where variation in memory and learning has already been found, individual and colony success will be compared to the ability of the colony members to learn and remember social contacts and experiences.  Findings from this work can help to better understand the impacts of social behavior on intelligence and provide a better understanding for why organisms, including humans, gravitate to social settings and groups.  Science education will be an important component of this project, including research opportunities for students as well as production of a comic book for middle school students that uses animal behavior research to teach students the scientific method.<br/><br/>The proposed work will use Polistes fuscatus wasps as a model to test the causes and consequences of variation in social intelligence. Despite decades of comparative work on the relationship between social behavior and intelligence, no previous studies have tested how and when selection acts on social intelligence. P. fuscatus provide a good model for this work because they use individual face recognition in daily interactions. Learning and remembering unique individuals allows the formation of individually differentiated social relationships, a challenging task that is thought to select for enhanced social intelligence. P. fuscatus also show extensive within-species variation in the ability to learn and remember unique conspecifics. The project has two main goals. 1) Test the factors that produce intraspecific variation in social intelligence, including the effects of social experience, nutrition, and genotype on cognitive variation.  Identifying how genotype and the environment interact to produce variation in social intelligence is important to understand how selection acts on this trait. 2)  Test the consequences of variation in social intelligence. Do individuals with enhanced social cognition benefit during social interactions relative to individuals with lesser social cognition?  This aim will provide the first intraspecific analysis of the selective consequences of social intelligence, testing a critical, untested prediction of the social intelligence hypothesis."

Prior to the analysis of genomes of many animals, it was assumed that animals developed differently because they had different protein-coding genes.  It is now realized that even very different animals have similar sets of genes, and it is not the genes themselves, but how they are used during embryonic development, that lead to differences.  How those genes are used differently during development is poorly understood, however, and is important for understanding the types of changes in animal shape that can occur during evolution.  This proposal takes advantage of a clear example of a set of genes that have evolved a new function, i.e. to make a larval skeleton in the sea urchin, while most echinoderms (the group that includes the sea urchins) make a skeleton only in the adult animal.  What changes in gene regulation led to this basic new ability?  Many community resources will be generated including DNA sequences that will be shared on publically available databases such as NCBI and Echinobase.  This proposal will also train postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates, including those from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science.  The broader public will also be engaged in this research through a series of public lectures in Carnegie Mellon's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and through outreach programs with local K-12 public schools. <br/><br/>The gene regulatory network (GRN) for the development of the sea urchin larval skeleton is very well known.  Other out-group echinoderm larvae have no or very reduced larval skeletons, yet all echinoderms make a skeleton after metamorphosis.  Prior evidence suggests that the sea urchin larval skeleton was co-opted from the GRN for the formation of this adult skeleton.  The first objective of this proposal is to determine the set of genes that have been co-opted from the adult skeletogenic program, and are differently expressed in the sea star mesoderm, which does not form a skeleton.  Differential RNA-Seq will be used to screen for potential genes in sea urchin, sea cucumbers, and a sea star.  Whole-mount in situ hybridization will be used to determine their spatial location.  The next objective is to understand how cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) can function in the new larval context and to understand the function of the subcircuits of the co-opted genes in larval sea urchins.  ChIP-Seq will identify CRMs and their associated genes.  Functional dissection of CRMs and perturbation of identified target genes that are shared targets will determine how these CRMs can function in both the original and new circuit, and also the types of trans environments, and subcircuit topologies that permit cooption.  This work will contribute to an understanding of the plasticity and evolvability of GRNs."

Of particular interest is (1) how P. polycephalum integrates noisy and sometimes contradictory information when selecting a food source; and (2) the role of its past experiences (e.g. the resources it has previously visited) on the outcome of its future choices. Because P. polycephalum is a macroscopic unicellular organism, it can be easily manipulated and observed, while retaining similar characteristics to other neuron-less, microscopic creatures. It is therefore a perfect model system to understand how most living beings integrate complex and dynamical information. The project will train 2 graduate students and at least 15 undergraduate and high school students in integrative research at one of the most diverse campuses in the US (Rutgers-Newark and NJIT, both located in Newark, NJ) and at a collaborating lab in Sydney, Australia. ""Hands-on"", open sourced demonstration kits for K-12 classes to experiment with slime mold locomotion and decision-making will be developed to encourage the study of cognitive processes in neuron-less organisms and other non-traditional model organisms. <br/><br/>The proposed project will set up a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework that can be used beyond the scope of this project to study decision-making in other neuron-less organisms and to establish comparisons with brained animals, thereby advancing our comprehension of the emergence of cognitive processes in biological systems. Cell micromanipulation and calcium imaging combined with analytical tools from neurophysiology and statistical physics will be used to first investigate the role of contractile oscillations of P. polycephalum's cellular plasma membrane in its decision-making process. In particular, the transfer and integration of information from different stimuli will be examined. The efficiency of the slime mold decision-making mechanism when the available information is noisy or contradictory will also be tested. Finally, whether the slime mold's natural positive geotaxis (motion in the direction of gravity) can be conditioned (i.e., reversed here) if food is always present uphill will be determined. This would indicate that the slime mold is capable of spatial associative learning (a first in the slime mold), and that its decision-making process is capable of adapting to the characteristics of the environment through which it moves. All methods, results and software developed during this project will be made freely available on a repository hosted by the Open Science Framework."

Couple this with other global changes resulting from human disturbance and it is clear that mechanisms underlying organism-environment interactions in response to stressful environmental factors are key. These responses, often called the ""stress response"" help the animal cope through the modification of physiology and behaviour that promote survival. The focus here will be on the stress hormone responses, particularly from the adrenal gland, that are a highly adaptive suite of physiological and behavioral traits that are conserved across vertebrates including humans. A basic understanding of how seasonal modulations of the stress response works will allow us to predict how vertebrate organisms adjust their physiology and behaviour in response to an increasingly capricious environment as well as across a species' range with an emphasis on those populations that are on the limits of, or have pushed beyond, their geographic range.  The PIs aim to educate K-12 students and teachers, while also reaching out to under-represented minorities (particularly Latinos in California) to enhance awareness, and conservation, of habitat for all organisms as well as birds. In these ways the work can be broadly disseminated to the public at large. In an era of dramatic environmental change, public awareness is critical and the broader impact activities will have far reaching influence. <br/><br/>Mechanisms underlying organism-environment interactions in response to perturbations of the environment are key for survival. The focus here will be on the hormonal response, particularly corticosteroids from the adrenal gland. The PIs have a good understanding of the responses to environmental stress in biomedical contexts, often under the chronic stress paradigm. However, these approaches do not mimic nature in which organisms experience seasonal cycles in environmental conditions and the stress response is modulated accordingly. Understanding how individuals push the boundaries of their coping strategies as well as geographic range is critical both from a basic science standpoint and for conservation. The proposed work will assess how the adrenocortical stress response is regulated using both laboratory and field studies to inform us of what brain centers are responsible for controlling seasonal fluctuation in the stress response. In addition, the focus will be on how the activity of these brain regions fluctuates across the annual cycle of environmental severity, and also across a species' range with an emphasis on those populations that are on the limits of, or have pushed beyond, their geographic range. A basic understanding of how the HPA axis works in species that undergo seasonal modulations in the stress response will also allow the PIs to predict how vertebrate organisms adjust their physiology and behavior in response to an increasingly capricious environment."

One such microbe is the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana that has been commercialized for pest control applications. In addition to their ability to target insects, B. bassiana is also able to form mutualistic associations with plants, resulting in increased plant growth and resistance to insects. This project seeks to understand the biological (genetic and biochemical) basis for the interactions between B. bassiana, insects, and plants. Understanding this process has important implications in beneficial versus pathogenic outcomes, environmental microbiology, and ecosystem balance. Knowledge gained from the proposal can be used to improve the efficacy and safety of using microbes for pest control and plant growth promotion. These interactions present an excellent model system for student laboratory activities relating to fundamental principles of host-parasite biology and evolution, fungal and insect physiology, symbiosis and mutualism, and application of the scientific method. The program provides resources, curriculum development, and citizen science outreach in mycology and entomology for use in K-12 classrooms and beyond. Training at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels are integrated within the scientific and outreach goals of the project.<br/><br/>Filamentous fungi are a major evolutionary branch of the eukaryotes. Several basal fungal lineages are parasites of invertebrates, and fungal-arthropod interactions represent ancient paradigms for examining pathogenesis. The filamentous fungus Beauveria bassiana is a pathogen of arthropods and forms endophytic relationships with plants. These two seemingly disparate interactions provide a tractable system with which to test and challenge some basic concepts regarding the evolution and persistence of mutualism and parasitism. Our central hypothesis is that in B. bassiana, mutualism and parasitism share underlying molecular determinants. To test this, our research aims to (a) perform a comparative molecular and biochemical analysis between the pathogenic insect interaction and the mutualistic plant interaction, emphasizing the transcriptional and regulatory networks involved, and (b) uncover additional molecular determinants of B. bassiana insect virulence and plant mutualism and examine their respective cross-contributions. This work would provide insight into the factors that contribute to trade-offs that occur during the  establishment and/or maintenance of pathogenic versus mutualistic outcomes during organismal interactions.  These interactions can be exploited to develop novel means of increasing the pest control and/or plant growth promotion potential of the fungus. Specific knowledge gained from the proposal aid understanding of two broad areas that address how organisms maintain phenotypic plasticity and sensitivity to dramatically different environments: (a) host-pathogen interactions and host-specificity, i.e. the pathways involved in insect virulence, and (b) mutualistic interactions, characterizing the pathways leading to endophyte establishment by the fungus."

The hippocampus, an area involved in memory formation, plays an important role in learned fear of a context. However, the specific ways in which emotional information is stored in hippocampal subregions are not well understood.This project will investigate the roles of the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampus in the encoding and consolidation of fear memories by combining in vivo recordings in freely moving mice with genetic, computational, and behavioral tools to evaluate how the firing properties of hippocampal neurons change over time as animals form and retrieve emotional memories. The expectation is that contextual representations in the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus will change as animals learn that a specific location is fearful. These experiments will be critical to our understanding of how episodic fear memories are encoded along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project will be to expand interest in the field of neuroscience by enhancing local infrastructure for education through contributions to the Neuroscience in Your World program organized by the Franklin Institute and the University of Pennsylvania.

Specialized pathogens have evolved suites of molecules called effectors that modulate host cell physiology and support parasitism. Over the past decades, a plethora of literature has documented the molecular mechanisms that underlie the induction of effective immune responses and subversion of effector-mediated host defenses. However, a key unresolved question is how pathogens alter cellular metabolism, including manipulation of the source-sink relationships, to acquire nutrients. This interdisciplinary project extends significantly beyond wet-lab techniques by integrating both biology and the rapidly evolving field of computer science for the advancement of research, education, and community-based scientific engagement. Mechanistic understanding of effector-mediated perturbations to mobilize sugars from the central vacuole will be pursued. Elucidating how pathogen infection modulates the global transcriptional dynamics and alters the flow of biological information is of prime focus. Equally paramount, cross-talk between metabolic, hormonal, circadian and immune signaling pathways, involving signals from pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial strains, will be revealed. Situated in the heart of Alabama, at a nationally recognized university for diversity, this project's scope extends into educational avenues as students in advanced level genomics courses will gain experience with relevant bioinformatic analyses, urban high school teachers in the PI's-led BioTeach program will gain exposure to the genetic innovations of today, and zealous recruiting efforts will seek to engage neighboring HBCU-minority students.<br/><br/>The central framework of this proposal, understanding how plant pathogens acquire sugars through the virulence activities of their effectors, presents a substantial advancement over the previously limiting dimensions of a one pathogen: one protein analysis approach. Specifically, this project is focused on a pathogen effector, HopD1, that physically interacts with a set of host proteins forming a functional module, termed 'vacuolar invertase (Vac-INV) module.' The mechanisms by which HopD1 perturbs the Vac-INV module to mobilize sugars stored in the central vacuole while slowing down the resorption  of apoplastic sugars into the host cell will be investigated. HopD1's immune response suppression through interference of a conserved aquaporin-mediated stomatal regulation mechanism will also be investigated. Based on the in silico modeling of Vac-INV?dependent transcriptional circuits, a high resolution global dynamic transcriptional regulatory network in plant-pathogen interactions will also also constructed. Having already developed a web-based interface, OOCEAN, for promoter and bioinformatics analyses, this project will continue to extend its utility in the fast-evolving world of Systems Biology. Novel network biology-based analyses will help obtain a broad understanding of how single effectors simultaneously target different branches of plant immunity and metabolism for the pathogen's advantage. This work will also result in a system that can be applied to other important questions pertaining to plant defense and metabolism as well. Collectively, this systems-level project will solidify global understanding of effector-host interactions, effector-mediated perturbations, and subsequently, dynamic transcriptional regulation."

Similar to other types of connections or so-called synapses between neurons, electrical synapses are known to undergo changes in strength.  However, the specific conditions that result in plasticity or changes in strength of electrical synapses are unknown. This project investigates the specific neuronal activity rules and underlying mechanisms whereby these synapses are modified by ongoing brain activity.  Further, this project aims to advance our understanding of how these activity-dependent modifications of electrical synapse strength impact brain function, in particular that processing of sensory information via the thalamus to the cortex. The findings will yield important new insights into the function of electrical synapses and their plasticity across the brain, and how the brain gates cortical attention to the sensory environment surrounding the organism.  The project involves a combination of brain research, undergraduate and graduate training in neuroscience concepts and research techniques, and educational development through special institutional programs aimed at disadvantaged children and youth, with a goal of public education and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) by traditionally underrepresented students.<br/><br/> Learning rules and mechanisms for long-term synaptic modification have been described extensively for neurotransmitter-based synapses. However, strikingly little is yet known about activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions. Because electrical synapses are widespread but their importance in mammalian brain function, it is critical that we advance our understanding of whether and how these types of essential synapses are regulated in a use-dependent manner.  The central hypothesis of this project is that the strength of electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus, the major inhibitory regulator of cortico-thalamic communication, is continuously updated by activity in electrically coupled neurons; in turn, this plasticity alters the synchrony within and the inhibitory output of the thalamic reticular nucleus. To test this hypothesis, the control and the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity is investigated using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic techniques. Aim 1 examines the mechanisms that underlie plasticity of electrical synapses, with the goal of elucidating and developing predictions about the relationship between activity and synaptic strength. Aim 2 measures the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity on synchrony within networks of coupled thalamic neurons, and thereby offers new insight into the inhibition that coupled interneurons deliver to their downstream targets. Aim 3 tests the functional role of electrical synapse plasticity in brain rhythms and network plasticity.  Together, the studies will lead to novel understanding of how electrical synapses contribute to brain function."

After production in the leaves, the sugar needs to be moved to other parts of the plant where this energy is consumed. These consuming tissues are termed 'sinks'. Analogous to our circulatory systems, plants have a network of cells called the phloem that allow the movement of sugars from source (leaves) to the sink tissues.  Scientists have long sought to increase the yield of crops by regulating the movement of sugars, the theory being that if supplies are increased, yield can be increased while the input of costly and environmentally problematic fertilizers is diminished. Previous work has identified a transporter within the phloem and this proposal aims to characterize the function of this key regulator in sugar transport.  Specifying how this transporter moves sugar to various tissues within the plant will allow scientists to develop strategies to optimize sugar translocation in crops that increase yield while reducing the environmental impacts of production agriculture. The Hispanic roots of the lead scientist for this project give this team an edge in engaging Hispanic audiences by communicating complex scientific topics in Spanish to ignite interest in science among the general public and among students. The scientists involved in this project will organize an international meeting on agricultural biotechnology and society, and will also develop bilingual web-based teaching tools to promote scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The partitioning of photoassimilates between their sites of production and utilization is a key determinant of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence suggests regulation of photoassimilate partitioning is mediated in part by a type I H+-PPase. A role for this transporter has been established at the tonoplast; however, this exclusive function has been unsettled by recent work showing plasma membrane (PM) localization of this transporter and establishing that it is prominently expressed in phloem companion cells (CC). The researchers propose this enzyme has two opposing roles, PPi hydrolysis and synthesis that contribute to a cascade of events that energize plant growth. They will test the capacity of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase to synthetize PPi in a heterologous system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in plants. Concurrently, a series of genetic, immunohistochemical and physiological experiments will determine how this pump affects the partitioning of assimilates. This fundamental research will catalog that H+-PPases as a central mediator involved in the allocation and metabolism of photosynthates."

One of the technical approaches used in the project, known by its acronym CRISPR -- creates genetic variation much the same way it occurs randomly in nature but with much greater speed, ease and target precision. The second technique, known as single-cell RNA-sequencing, allows researchers to measure activity of, potentially, every gene in a single cell. Together, the two methods allow a ""miniaturization"" of the breeding approach -- testing many crop variants to find ones with useful agricultural traits. Different, single cell variants can be generated by the millions using CRISPR, subjected to a stress in which only the fittest cells survive, and those cells analyzed for the precise changes that allowed them to survive using single-cell RNA-sequencing. This method, used in conjunction with classical breeding approaches, can serve as a resource for plant breeders and geneticists working to understand the genetic regulators of traits that are important for stable crop production. In the education goals of the project, the investigators will extend a successful program that trains talented New York City high student interested in a career in science.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to develop pooled CRISPR/single-cell RNA-seq screens in maize protoplasts to introduce a novel approach to plant breeding and genetic analysis. Using CRISPR and associated endonucleases like Cas9, large-scale genetic screens will be carried out in which a diverse set of guide-RNAs is transfected into a pool of millions of cells. The cells are then subjected to a selection; survivors identify beneficial perturbations while underrepresented genotypes in the pool identify genes necessary to survive the stress. Coupled with single-cell RNA-seq, this approach provides a sensitive readout of genetic pathways, and has been used successfully in animal cells. The method has not yet been applied to plants and could not only represent an increase in the scale of crop screening but also reveal genetic targets for plant breeding that have previously been obscured by genetic redundancy. With the ability to screen millions of cells, libraries can also be transfected at titers that lead to multiple guides per cell, effectively allowing higher order mutants to be screened quickly and easily. Many important stress tolerance traits are known to be mediated at the cell level, and marker assisted selection allows screening for targeted pathways that regulate tissue level traits. The project will assess the efficiency of CRISPR in maize cells in pilot experiments that target the auxin signaling pathway using auxin response markers as a selection tool.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these signals are small molecules, called peptides, that are perceived by other ""receptor"" molecules in the plant cell.  A cascade of developmental information is transmitted when peptides find their receptors, similar to the opening of a door by a key in a lock. Surprisingly, scientists discovered that receptors are also used by plants to detect signals from invading pathogens. Upon detection, plants can then ward off further pathogen attack by activating an arsenal of molecular defenses. How these related and similar receptors function in normal plant development and also plant defense is puzzling and remains an important unanswered question in plant biology. This research tackles the problem by identifying the molecular basis of peptide recognition and by deciphering how receptors control both development and defense. Specifically, the research addresses the question of how the same receptor family can distinguish between very different peptide signals to activate different cell signaling pathways. The research brings together a diverse and international group of scientists with complementary technical skills to address these questions. Challenges to plant health from pathogens remain a pressing problem facing national food security, as diseases spread widely across the globe. The outcomes of this research provide foundational information that can be applied to improving disease resistance in plants. In the process, students and post-doctoral researchers are trained in cutting edge interdisciplinary science in the area of basic plant development and practical plant health. <br/><br/>Peptide perception in plant pathogen interactions and development are mediated primary receptors belonging to the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane kinase superfamily. Individual primary receptors mediate specific peptide binding, but it is becoming clear that diverse receptors can use specific and often shared co-receptors for peptide recognition and downstream signaling. The molecular basis of specificity in both recognition and downstream signaling is unclear. This research studies the structural basis of how related receptors use co-receptors to recognize specific peptide ligands. In addition, the project aims to use phosphoproteomics and quantitative biochemistry to determine how specific ligand perception is transduced into specific downstream signaling outputs. The project will also decipher the function of a clade of receptor interactors in the control of both development and defense receptor signaling using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods. It is envisioned that this work will provide a molecular framework for understanding how specificity is encoded at the molecular level in receptor kinase signaling, setting the stage for engineering these pathways in crops in the future as one of the major broader impacts of the reseach.

Since the bacterial cell wall is an important antibiotic target and triggers immune responses, understanding bacterial growth is of broad fundamental interest. The proposed work will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying growth of the plant pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A. tumefaciens is the causative agent of crown gall disease in hundreds of flowering plants and is a particular problem for nursery plants such as apple, plum, and cherry. Remarkably, A. tumefaciens exhibits an atypical form of bacterial growth, in which new growth is restricted to one end of the cell (asymmetric growth). Asymmetric bacterial cell growth is relatively poorly understood, but has been observed frequently in diverse soil dwelling bacteria. Thus, the proposed scientific work is expected to provide key insights regarding mechanisms of bacterial growth, which may lead to important applications such as limiting crown gall disease. Finally, in collaboration with experts in science education, a hands-on, inquiry based lab module on the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria will be developed. This module will provide high school students with an opportunity to participate in research and will provide an understanding of evolutionary processes.<br/><br/>Many important questions remain about the mechanism and regulation of cell wall biogenesis. How is cell wall biogenesis controlled in time and space? How are cell lengths and widths maintained? These questions have been primarily addressed in model bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which utilize a dispersed mode of cell wall growth. Expanding the analysis of bacterial cell growth into organisms with asymmetric growth will reveal new mechanisms for the biosynthesis, assembly, and regulation of cell wall biogenesis. In this project, the objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying unipolar growth of bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiales clade of Alphaproteobacteria using A. tumefaciens as a model. The following questions will be used to guide this work. How is cell wall biogenesis restricted to the new pole during elongation? How is cell wall biogenesis redirected to mid-cell to enable cell division and prime the new poles to serve as active sites for cell wall biogenesis? Recent advances in imaging cell wall biogenesis will be used to probe the mechanism of unipolar growth. Using a systematic approach, the role of candidate proteins in the biosynthesis, assembly, or regulation of cell wall biogenesis will be characterized. Genetic screens will be utilized to reveal additional proteins involved in bacterial cell growth processes. The proposed studies will improve the current understanding of how cell wall biogenesis is spatially and temporally regulated and will provide key insights into a relatively unexplored, but prevalent mode of bacterial cell growth."

Intriguingly, social insect colonies show the same level of reduced metabolism with increasing colony size. This project will combine experiments and mathematical models to determine the relationships between energy use and the organization of work in ant colonies. Ant colonies serve as an exemplar for this question, because their highly coordinated societies are organized around the work needed to sustain colony growth and maintenance, analogous to metabolic processes in organisms. Understanding the mechanisms underlying metabolic scaling has potential applications in physiology, medicine, and agriculture. The energy-based models and experiments in this project will be relevant well beyond social insect colonies, including informing human population scaling issues. The project will connect this research with a Mathematics and Social Biology Co-mentoring Program, to train research teams of undergraduates together in biology and mathematics. Students will participate in a formal training program on social biological principles and simulation modeling, and then participate as cross-disciplinary teams in collaborative research. Existing connections with research and minority programs at ASU will be used to recruit under-represented students into the program. Teaching modules on group size, social behavior, and metabolism for online K-12 use will also be developed in collaboration with ASU's Ask-a-Biologist outreach program. This project is co-funded by the Animal Behavior program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, and the BIOMAPS program for proposals at the interface of Biology, Math and the Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>Group size is one of the most fundamental attributes of sociality, with important effects on social organization and fitness. Previous work has found that larger harvester ant colonies (Pogonomyrmex californicus) exhibit allometric changes in task performance and activity patterns, including increased worker specialization. They additionally shift the allocation of effort, possibly away from more expensive tasks. Potentially coupled with this, colonies also show a consistent pattern of hypometric metabolic scaling, which matches that of organismal scaling patterns. Because task performance is directly linked to colony growth and metabolism, these results lead to the hypothesis that larger colonies achieve economies of scale in energy use from scaling changes in the organization of work. To examine how colony size influences work organization, the distribution of workers across tasks, individual task specialization, and worker activity levels will be measured in laboratory colonies of varying size. Colony metabolism, brood production and growth rates will be measured simultaneously to link behavioral organization to colony metabolic consequences. Additionally, colony demographics, including worker size and age distributions, will be assessed for their contributions to variation in metabolism. These parameters will be measured for: (a) colonies that vary in size but not age; (b) colonies changing in size ontogenetically over time; (c) size-manipulated colonies. The empirical research will be combined with simulation, differential equation and optimization models to ask how components of task organization and activity might interact to generate scaling changes in colony metabolism and productivity."

Interestingly, even when a stimulus is fixed, such as the odor from a food source, behavioral responses can be diverse, almost necessarily influenced by an assortment of factors ranging from the animal's internal state to memory. These collectively determine which one of many possible behaviors will be selected. In the odor example, the decision to approach the food source may be influenced by the degree of satiety vs. hunger, the valence of the odor (were these odors ""good"" the last time they were encountered?), any memory the animal might have about lurking predators (a calculation of risk versus reward), or an efficient strategy for search the animal has learned.  These are examples of the array of information that gets integrated to select ""the correct"" behavior for survival in a complex world.  Recent evidence suggests that control points for behavioral flexibility can happen as early as the level at which sensory information is first processed.  In this model, feedback or top-down projections from higher processing areas directly alter patterns of neuronal firing in primary sensory regions.  As a result, these feedback projections affect behavior by manipulating how stimuli are encoded in primary sensory regions.  Thus, animals respond differently because they encode the world differently. This project uses an array of experimental and computational tools to advance understanding of this top-down modulation of sensory information.  The project also includes the implementation of a computational neuroscience course for senior undergraduate and graduate students, and of a Virtual Reality program that enables students, including K-12 and local community college students, to visualize dynamics of neural networks.<br/><br/>This project investigates central modulation of peripheral sensory processing as a mechanism of influencing behavioral endpoints.  To study this question, two things are required: A feedback circuit in the brain that 1) encodes for complex representations including memory, fear, and anxiety for instance, and 2) targets primary sensory regions.  Recent studies have identified a direct feedback connection from the ventral CA1 (vCA1) region of the hippocampus (that encodes fear, internal state, social information, and learning) to the main olfactory bulb 1 synapse from where odors are first detected in the mouse. This connection provides a compact experimental system with which to interrogate how internal states and/or learning and memory influence the neuronal representations of sensory stimuli at the earliest stages. By using this circuit, this project: (1) examines the patterns of connectivity between vCA1, the olfactory bulb and other known target regions to identify the networks involved in this feedback control; and (2) determines how vCA1 feedback reshapes the activity of neurons in the main olfactory bulb in response to odors.  For the first aim, newly developed retrograde tracers are used to label connections from vCA1 to the bulb in tandem with automated whole brain reconstruction methods to identifying the structural logic of feedback circuits. For the second aim, optogenetic technology is used to control vCA1 activity while recording the activity of large populations of neurons in the main olfactory bulb, and thus to identify the physiological effects of feedback projections and the role feedback plays in encoding information about odor identity and concentration.

The goal of this project is to generate new molecular tools to precisely control where and when auxin is made as a way to manipulate plant growth, particularly in the root. Taking advantage of the powerful gene editing and targeting technology (CRISPR), this project generates programmable genetic devices (biological logic gates), that make it possible to turn genes of interest (such as auxin biosynthesis genes) on and off at will. The basic principles and tools developed in this project have the potential for broad applications in agriculture and beyond. The protocols and materials generated in this study serve as the basis for a new Synthetic Biology course for upper level undergraduate and beginning graduate students at NC State University. In addition, the investigator has adapted some of these materials for workshops that provide training and resources for high school teachers. The investigator also establishes a molecular biology tool ""lending library"" that enables local teachers to execute molecular experiments in their classrooms. Furthermore, continuation of the previously established bilingual (English and Spanish) hands-on Plants4Kids demonstrations with live plants and seeds at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences and local elementary schools brings the excitement of experimental sciences to the youngest audiences. These activities expose young people to scientific methods and demystify agricultural and plant genetic techniques.<br/><br/>Biology research is often restricted by the choice of promoters available to drive the expression of genes of interest in complex patterns and at desired levels. To overcome this limitation, a series of easily programmable CRISPR-based synthetic genetic circuits are developed to integrate multiple inputs from previously described synthetic and natural promoters. These new tools take advantage of crRNA:tracrRNA gRNA pairs and combine inputs from two or more different drivers/promoters to delimit where a dCas9-based synthetic transcription factors activate or represses target gene expression. The proposed approach rests on two or more pseudo-orthogonal gRNA pairs and is compatible with the construction of all basic logic gates to produce multiple derived patterns of targeted gene expression. In theory, this technology can produce hundreds of orthogonal genetic components that in combination perform complex logic operations. The new strategy is not only scalable, but also enables tuning of gene expression levels, thus providing an unprecedented degree of flexibility in targeted gene expression. To demonstrate the utility of the new approach, the investigator regulates the tissue specific expression of local auxin production in roots in an auxin-deficient mutant and interrogates the effects on root architecture; thus addressing a long-standing question on the role of local auxin production in maintaining the stem cell niche or plant roots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.

This project develops and applies novel molecular biology approaches for revealing the mechanisms used by stress-tolerant tilapia, but lacking in stress-sensitive tilapia, for coping with environmental (in particular, salinity) change. This is especially important because tilapia are the most rapidly growing aquaculture commodity world-wide and knowledge about which species to select for increased food production in the developing world is critical. These studies also inform us about the evolutionary time scales needed for these fish, as well as other animals, to adapt to environmental changes. In addition, the project facilitates assessment of the potential for invasiveness if tilapia are cultured in non-native habitats. This project advances education by training of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from minorities that are underrepresented in the sciences. It also provides outreach to K-12 students and educators, aquaculture producers, and conservation organizations. It includes international collaborations and student exchange in Africa and Israel.

Objective 1 is to determine mRNAs and proteins that are altered by salinity in euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) compared to a congeneric stenohaline species, O. niloticus. This objective includes comparison of salinity effects on mRNA and protein abundances and identification of relevant single amino acid variants (SAVs) and post-translational modifications. Objective 2 is to reveal inducible cis-elements in euryhaline tilapia using a combination of experimental (enhancer trapping) and bioinformatics (motif searching) approaches. Objective 3 is to purify the transcription factor that activates the tilapia osmotically/salinity responsive enhancer in IMPA1 and MIPS genes by affinity-based, functional complementation, and mass spectrometry approaches. Objective 4 comprises genome editing in tilapia cells to determine whether MIPS and IMPA1 genes, and the NKA3a SAV A428?¨S are necessary for maintaining high cellular osmotolerance. Effects on cellular phenotype will be assessed by cell morphology/ proliferation assays, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Objective 5 is to perform genome editing of a target informed by Objective 4 in whole tilapia.

How plants can do this without constantly creating bubbles in their hydraulic systems, which act to block the water transport is still not completely understood. Engineers have not been able to replicate water transport under negative pressure, except in very small amounts over very short distances under idealized laboratory conditions.  So how can trees move vast quantities of water through the xylem (wood) in their trunks under negative pressure? The goal of this research is to determine the role of natural oils (lipids) in this process. Lipids have been found covering the surfaces of xylem vessels in plants. The project will determine the composition, locations, origins, and possible functions of lipids in xylem of vascular plants and test the hypothesis that lipids are required for negative pressure transport. The research will increase the understanding of plant adaptation to water stress, and could potentially lead to engineered systems that replicate plant water transport under negative pressure. The research will involve undergraduate students, including from groups currently underrepresented in the sciences, and its broader impacts will include education about plant water transport both in academic courses and public outreach events.<br/><br/>It has been an axiom of the cohesion-tension theory that it is the high surface tension of water that protects xylem conduits against bubble entry. This axiom was recently challenged by findings that xylem sap of flowering plants contains significant amounts of surface-active lipids and that surfactants isolated from xylem sap strongly reduced the sap's surface tension. Moreover, surfactant-coated bubbles were found in sap, suggesting that plants can transport water in the presence of bubbles, rather than needing to prevent their formation completely. This research addresses the questions: 1. Are apoplastic lipids found in xylem of all major groups of vascular plants? 2. What is the composition of apoplastic lipids in different plants? 3. Where in the xylem are apoplastic lipids located? 4. Where do apoplastic xylem lipids originate? The research will use 15 representative species of all major vascular plant lineages using imaging via TEM, confocal super-resolution microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, as well as by lipidomic analyses of xylem sap and xylem tissue using mass spectrometry.

This proposal seeks to understand how seedlings use chemical signals to modulate their growth in response to adverse environmental conditions, a response that allows them to endure environmental stress at a time when they are most vulnerable. Specific research aims include the identification of mechanisms for signal perception, the metabolic fate of signals in seedlings after perception, and the discovery of the signaling networks activated during seedling stress. Broader applications of this research include the potential for designing new breeding targets in crops for improved field emergence. In addition, the proposed research activities are integrated with undergraduate training opportunities through a newly-designed research course at the University of North Texas, a large minority-serving, public university. <br/><br/>N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are ethanolamide-conjugated fatty acid derivatives that in animal systems include the widely-recognized bioactive endogenous metabolites of the ""endocannabinoid signaling pathway"". This pathway regulates an array of physiological and behavioral processes in mammals, but despite the documented occurrence of NAEs in plant systems, their physiological actions remain incompletely understood. Recent evidence indicates that oxylipin derivatives of polyunsaturated NAEs have potent biological activities in both animal and plant systems, and in plants this may be one major route of action for NAEs. This proposal aims to expand the understanding of this group of bioactive lipids and their role as negative regulators of seedling growth in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, through the following three specific aims: 1) Identify NAE oxylipin target proteins with biotinylated probes; 2) Determine if NAE oxylipins are substrates for the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH); 3) Delineate the spatial interaction of NAE oxylipins with ABA- and G-protein signaling in roots and shoots of seedlings. Results from this research may ultimately lead to new targets for the improvement of crop emergence under environmental stress, and may also offer new strategies for reduction of competing weed emergence in early season crop establishment. In addition to the potential broader applications, this project will offer training opportunities for undergraduate students through a newly-designed research course at the University of North Texas-- Advanced Research in Life Sciences (BIOL 3900)."

Frogs and salamanders have easily accessible physiology, life cycles, and behavior that can be used to study general questions in biology. There are over 5,000 species of frogs that show a great deal of natural diversity, where each species has adapted in unique ways to its environment. Many of these species are at risk of extinction, mainly due to habitat degradation and spread of a lethal fungus throughout the world that can kill entire frog populations. The investigators of this project, together with a network of amphibian researchers, develop gene-editing tools for frogs and salamanders. The purpose of this genetic toolkit is to enable researchers to test predictions of how genes or proteins influence behavior and development, both in the pristine laboratory as well as the muddy rainforest. This project also involves training of undergraduate and graduate students, and researchers from around the world through hands-on training courses and the development of online community resources. One training course is held at Stanford University to support the training of researchers in the United States. Another, international workshop is held in South America, which holds much of the world's amphibian biodiversity. In addition, the project expands a successful regional program called the Frogger School Program to a nationwide resource with education materials for K-12 classrooms in rural and inner-city public schools.<br/><br/>Amphibians are a diverse group of vertebrates with unique evolutionary innovations in morphology, behavior, and physiology. Most of these striking phenotypes are not represented in the few amphibian species with functional genomics tools, severely hindering progress on understanding how genetic variation influences the incredible phenotypic variation observed within this speciose group. South American poison frogs have evolved warning coloration, chemical defenses, and complex parental behaviors, where each of these traits varies both within and between species. Moreover, this suite of traits has evolved independently in some African frog species, allowing built-in replication for addressing links between genotype and phenotype. This research proposal focuses on the development of functional genomics tools in poison frogs, with plans to expand and disseminate these technologies to the broader amphibian community. Specifically, the goals of the project are to develop a general amphibian genetic toolkit to (1) enable gene disruption using CRISPR/Cas9 and morpholino technologies, (2) express transgenic materials using expression vector insertions, and (3) develop electroporation techniques to manipulate genes in specific cell types or tissues. Another goal is rapid dissemination of this toolkit through the online distribution of protocols and hands-on workshops to train the next generation of amphibian biologists to integrate newly developed, cutting-edge technologies into their research programs. Finally, an existing regional K-12 outreach program is expanded into a nationwide resource for educators and local amphibian researchers to connect with one another and bring amphibian biology, conservation, and evolution into public school classrooms.

Since metabolic rate determines the rate at which an animal acquires and spends energy, it has often been considered the fundamental driver of pace of life. The influence of metabolic rate on pace of life can be complex. A higher metabolic rate, by allowing more activity and resource acquisition, can lead to a faster pace of life, but, burning more energy can also lead to a slower pace of life. Studies investigating the relationship between metabolic rate and pace of life often produce ambiguous results. The broad objective of this research is to select genetic lines of honeybees with different metabolic rates and experimentally test how differences in metabolic rate interact with resource availability to determine pace of life. Using the honeybee colony as an experimental model allows an understanding of not only how metabolic rate determines pace of life at the individual level but also how interindividual variation in metabolic rate determines pace of life at the colony level. Understanding this important relationship between metabolic rate and life history can contribute to biomedical sciences as metabolic rate critically influences various health parameters. The development and maintenance of genetic lines of bees with different metabolic rate will also be a novel biological resource for research and potentially to the beekeeping industry.<br/><br/>Metabolic rate (MR) is often considered the fundamental rate that drives all biological processes at all levels of biological organization. A central question in biology therefore is how the functional properties at any level of organization are determined by the MR of its constituent parts. By selecting and breeding genetic lines of honeybees with different MR and creating colonies with different metabolic (rate) compositions, this research will provide an experimental test of the relationship between MR and pace of life (POL) at the individual and the colony level. The project will use an integrative approach based in genetics, physiology and behavior to ask how MR of an individual impacts its POL and its social contribution, how the POL at a group level is determined by the MR and POL of its individual members, and how MR interacts with the resource environment to regulate individual and colony POL. The integrative experimental approach combined with path analysis will allow a causal test of the connection between MR and POL, providing answers regarding the functional links that connects physiology to life history evolution. By combining measurements of MR with economic analysis of individual work contribution in a social insect colony, the research will add to our understanding regarding how interindividual variation in MR and POL scale up to drive POL at a higher level of biological organization in the evolution of eusociality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the diversity of cultivated varieties is very limited.  The lack of genetic diversity in cultivated coffee varieties makes them extremely vulnerable to diseases and stress brought on by variable weather patterns.  The devastating disease and developmental stresses that cultivated coffee is currently facing are reducing yield and quality at an alarming rate in parts of Latin America and Africa, and bringing economic ruin to small-holder farmers.  Efforts are therefore urgently needed to improve disease resistance and agronomic traits for adaptation to climate change pressures, and having complete genome sequences is a very important tool for coffee breeding.  Arabica coffee is a complex species because it contains four copies of its genome, a legacy of the cross between two ancestral species that gave rise to coffee.  These additional copies now complicate the sequencing process.  The availability of complete genome sequences for cultivated Arabica coffee and its ancestral species is expected to make it easier to find additional genetic diversity in natural populations and in populations used for breeding.  Experiments will focus on discovery of genetic variation for resistance to the fungal strains responsible for the current coffee rust epidemic, and resistance to the coffee berry borer, an insect pest newly arrived in the US, and whose population is expanding in elevated temperatures.<br/> <br/>The current grant aims at (i) sequencing, assembling, scaffolding, and annotating the genome of Arabica coffee (the allotetraploid Coffea arabica), assisted by high quality assemblies of the genomes of its putative diploid parents (C. eugenioides and C. canephora),  (ii) building a DNA sequence resource for detection of genomic polymorphism in highly heterozygous breeding and natural populations, and (iii) generating and analyzing transcriptome sequence resources enriched for comprehensive profiles of gene expression in leaves, berries and flowers exposed to different stresses. Broad genotyping and transcriptome analyses combined with refined phenotyping performed on advanced breeding and natural populations of C. arabica will identify the genes and their alleles responsible for phenotypic variation in important agronomic traits.  The research will generate the first highly detailed datasets that associate relationships between genotype and phenotype for coffee traits relevant to adaptation, furnishing a basis for molecular-assisted coffee breeding. This grant will lead to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small indels, copy number variants, and present/absent variants that will provide the essential means to translate the unexploited genomic diversity of the genus into coffee breeding programs without jeopardizing desirable quality traits critical to consumers and the US coffee industry.  The project will also contribute importantly to the crop genomics community goals of developing more high-quality genomic resources for research of phylogenetically diverse polyploid genomes for evolutionary and genetics studies to gain better understanding of how polyploidy affects the crop genotype and evolutionary fitness.  To promote research and education spanning biology, mathematics and computer sciences, this grant will support training opportunities for students at postgraduate, graduate, undergraduate and high school levels hosted at collaborating partner institutions. Web-based educational resources and annual workshops on coffee genomics will be developed to help promote the use of bioinformatics and molecular-genomic tools in academic and scientific research programs, as well as to demonstrate to coffee breeders the utility of genomics-based tools.  The project results will be widely accessible to the international coffee and plant genomics community through the International Coffee Genomics Network (ICGN) website (http://www.coffeegenome.org), which will link to other public websites that have already curated coffee information, including open source curated databases funded by NSF.  Cornell University is founding member of ICGN and supports actively with Bioversity International, the secretariat of the network."

This project is to develop and apply technology to monitor brain and behavior from birth to adulthood of the roundworm C. elegans, an important and widely studied model for neuroscience. A controlled environment will be created where individual animals are born, roam freely, and grow to adulthood while a microscope continuously scans the activity patterns of every neuron in the worm's nervous system. Because of their rapid maturation (<2 days) and small nervous system (<302 neurons), the technology will be used to answer fundamental questions about the developing brain. For example, how do highly conserved behavioral patterns like forward and reverse movement emerge from a nervous system that adapts to a body that grows ten-fold from birth to adult? Coordinating the parallel development of brain, body, and behavior is a problem faced by all animals. The accessibility of C. elegans will yield the first comprehensive measurements of brain and behavior development in any animal. Bringing together developmental biology, neurophysiology, and neurotechnology will train young scientists who will work at the rich interface between the physical and life sciences.<br/><br/>A system will be developed-- a motorized, rotating agar-coated ball-- upon which a nematode can freely move without interruption as it feeds, grows, molts through four larval stages, and becomes an adult.

These experiments will provide unprecedented datasets that describe the behavioral life history of an individual animal in temporal correlation with whole brain activity patterns. Comparison of these rich datasets between wild-type animals and informative mutants will allow dissection of a wide range of interconnected and shared processes in neurodevelopment, regulation, learning, and memory. For example, understanding the developmental progression of the motor circuit will be achieved by obtaining circuit-wide measurements that describe how the 20-neuron motor circuit that drives the forward and backward movements of the 0.1-mm long juvenile worm is expanded into the 80-neuron motor circuit that drives the same movements of the 1-mm long adult. These studies will illuminate system-wide changes in the nervous system as it dynamically keeps up with animal growth."

A good example is the immune system, which organisms need to carefully control so that it can be rapidly activated when faced with a threatening pathogen, but kept in check to prevent damaging side effects. In plants, one of the strongest immune responses is triggered when intracellular immune receptors detect the presence of intruding pathogen proteins deployed by the pathogen to manipulate the host cell, a process called effector-triggered immunity. This project aims to uncover principles by which living organisms calibrate the complex signaling modules that regulate the specificity and intensity of immune responses. On a practical level, detailed knowledge of the plant immune response may lead to crop plants with improved durability of innate pathogen resistance in the long term, with significant benefits to sustainable agricultural and biomass production and the environment. This project's broader impacts also include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and of a post-doctoral researcher.

Current understanding of SRFR1 protein function suggests that SRFR1 is an immune adaptor protein that temporally and spatially regulates the presence and stability of protein complexes to fine-tune immune outputs. In this project, the mechanisms that regulate SRFR1 protein-protein interactions will be investigated. Specifically, the indication that SRFR1 binds SUMO, a small protein that is attached to other proteins to regulate their location in the cell, suggests a mechanism for regulating SRFR1 interactions with other proteins by SUMOylation. This will be tested using a combination of genetics, cell biology and proteomics to establish whether and when SUMOylation of SRFR1 client proteins occurs, and whether this determines the cellular location of protein complexes. In addition, the project will investigate if pathogens interfere with this process."

This is true for animals, just as it is for humans. The broad goal of this work is to resolve how social interactions can both improve and compromise learning and memory through changes in stress hormone levels. By studying how social experiences impact learning in animals (here, birds) we can understand the costs and benefits of social interactions in a variety of social animals, including ourselves. This project is important to the fields of neuroscience and behavior because we are studying the benefits of social enrichment on brain function and learning. Most prior work has focused only on the negative consequences of social conflict and elevated stress hormone levels. This work is relevant to human society because the basic physiological and brain processes in the bird species to be studied are shared with humans; determining how social conditions impact stress hormones and learning in birds will provide information as to how social interactions impact human health and learning. This experimental work in animals will specifically determine if and how social enrichment could improve learning through effects on stress hormones.

Despite extensive work on the role of evolutionary processes in shaping cognition and sociality, few studies have addressed the potential for social conditions to drive changes in cognitive performance and underlying neuroplasticity during an animal's lifetime. Moreover, most studies to date have focused on the potential deleterious effects of social conflict, without considering how social interaction may support cognition and brain function. Social conflict can impair cognition through the effects of elevated glucocorticoids on underlying brain mechanisms. However, the reciprocal hypothesis, that social contact may enhance cognitive performance by maintaining glucocorticoid levels in an optimal range to support cognition and brain function, has not been tested. This project will take the experimental approach of simultaneous manipulation of both social and physiological variables in a social songbird, the zebra finch (Poephila guttata), to resolve the consequences, mechanisms, and developmental origins of individual variation in cognition. This work will move us toward understanding complex relationships among environmental factors and internal regulatory mechanisms. Further, addressing how social contact and underlying glucocorticoids may enhance cognition moves us beyond a historic focus (now well recognized as being flawed) on the impairments caused by this endocrine pathway and builds upon a broadening understanding of the adaptive role of stress. Finally, this project will support the training of K-12 teachers and high school students from underserved rural communities in Appalachia by involving them in the research."

By doing so, the research will provide important insights into how behavior acts to help maintain species boundaries. The research has critical implications for understanding biodiversity and conservation of endangered species that could hybridize with others. In carrying out this work, the PI will train undergraduates and graduate students in both research techniques and public outreach. Indeed, the PI and her lab members will engage in public outreach in North Carolina and beyond through work at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Specifically, they will give talks in the museum's Daily Planet Theater, which provides live programming to museum visitors and live streaming of presentations to K-12 schools, senior centers, and libraries throughout North Carolina. Videos of these presentations are uploaded as podcasts onto iTunes University, on which the museum receives 20,000 downloads a month, and to the museum's website, which receives approximately one million hits per year; programs distributed via the museums website are available to users anywhere.<br/><br/>Under the widely used biological species concept, species are defined as groups of organisms that do not exchange genes; they possess evolved features that prevent gene flow between them. A major class of such 'isolating mechanisms' includes traits that engender low fitness in hybrid offspring, thereby preventing them from backcrossing to the parent populations. Because hybrid maladaptation is crucial to the speciation process, clarifying the causes of hybrid maladaptation is central to understanding speciation.  Most speciation research has focused on three causes of hybrid maladaptation: decreased survival, reduced fertility, and decreased likelihood of succeeding in either parental niche. In contrast, the role of behavior in hybrid maladaptation, specifically that hybrids might exhibit dysfunctional reproductive behavior, has been relatively understudied. Yet, viable, fertile hybrids might fail to respond appropriately to courtship signals, or, alternatively, they might express mate preferences that reduce their likelihood of mating with fitness-enhancing mates. Such dysfunctional reproductive behavior could render viable, fertile hybrids 'behaviorally sterile', thereby acting as a potentially key isolating mechanism between species.  The proposed work will ascertain if hybrid spadefoot toads display dysfunctional reproductive behaviors, and whether such behavior explains patterns of gene exchange in natural populations. Using two species of naturally hybridizing toads, the research will: 1) evaluate hybrid responses to breeding opportunities; 2) establish hybrid mate preferences; 3) measure the fitness consequences of mate preferences; 4) ascertain whether hybrids invest less in reproduction; and 5) determine patterns of hybrid mating in the field. Together, the projects will identify behavior's role in the origins and maintenance of species boundaries."

These genetic studies have produced fundamental insights into animal development and other critical biological processes. However, there are currently no effective approaches for genetically modifying any of the more than 10,000 described species of reptile. As a consequence, studies of gene function have almost completely excluded this diverse and highly successful group of animals. This project advances the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, as a system for comparative studies of reptile evolution, development, and gene function. Anolis lizards have served as important models for studies of evolution, behavior, and ecology for many decades, and the brown anole is ideal for genetic studies due its small size, ease of husbandry, continuous egg production, and low cost. The project involves establishment of a new lizard model system with genome-editing capabilities to facilitate basic research studies of gene function and gene regulation in this understudied group of vertebrates. Achievement of these goals will enable the identification of genetic mechanisms that are deeply conserved across different vertebrates, as well as enable genetic studies of reptile evolution that are not currently feasible. The project also involves hosting of two Anolis workshops to train a cadre of researchers in how to create genetically modified lizards, as well as opportunities for hands-on research experiences for undergraduate and high-school students, with special emphasis on the engagement of students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project is focused on enabling two technologies for use in the brown anole lizard: CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing and transposon-based transgenesis. The project focuses on development of methods to surgically access maturing oocytes within adult A. sagrei females to allow the microinjection of unfertilized oocytes with genome modification reagents. Oocyte microinjection of Cas9 RNPs or transposon mRNA with appropriate transgene cassettes are performed to produce genetically modified brown anole lizards by targeted genome-editing or transgenesis, respectively. In addition, immortalized lines of A. sagrei fibroblasts are established to create a lizard cell culture system for detailed investigations of cellular mechanisms using CRISPR/Cas9. Protocols developed during this project are made freely available in the form of an Anolis Genome Manipulation Handbook. The development of genome-editing and transgenesis tools in A. sagrei will establish the first reptilian model system where functional genetic experimental approaches are available.

For example, in many non-mammalian vertebrates including some fish, most turtles, and all crocodilians, environmental temperatures occurring during a specific period of incubation will determine if individuals develop as either a male or female. Previous findings have revealed a critical role for the endocrine system and epigenetics, heritable changes in gene function without changes in DNA sequence, in determining how the environment impacts traits. This project will determine the mechanisms by which environments and hormone signaling act on epigenetic processes to shape developmental trajectories and produce phenotypic diversity. The project focuses on species displaying temperature-dependent sex determination, to address how temperature induces and coordinates radically different phenotypic trajectories. The study will support the training and mentoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate researchers, with recruiting efforts aimed at under-represented groups in the sciences. The project will develop a primer focused on communicating common misperceptions about epigenetics. The findings will be presented to students at area schools as part of an established outreach program. Together, this work will advance the understanding of the mechanisms that determine how organisms interact with the environments and will provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>The work will employ state of the art sequencing approaches to advance a developmental- and endocrine-based understanding of how adaptive epigenetic responses occur in nature, and how epigenetic responses are disrupted by environmental stressors for which a shared evolutionary history is absent. The Parrott Lab has previously observed widespread sexually dimorphic DNA methylation patterning across the gonadal genome. However, the developmental and molecular processes by which a bipotential genome acquires a sexually dimorphic epigenome is unclear. Developmental windows of environmental sensitivity will first be identified by resolving the temporal dynamics of the DNA methylome during temperature-dependent sex determination and reproductive development. Combinatorial treatments of temperature and hormones will then reveal the degree to which temperature and endocrine signals act on overlapping or distinct regions of the epigenome. Finally, the project will investigate the influence of environmental quality on the sexually dimorphic methylome. Given the inherent environmental sensitivity of temperature-dependent sex determination, it is hypothesized that environmental variables (other than temperature) also influence this process to affect the development and subsequent function of the reproductive system. Together, experiments will reveal how environmental and biological signals are integrated into developmental processes that result in phenotypic diversity. Findings from this work will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national and international scientific, and more broadly via outreach activities in partnership with area schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some aspects of the routine are controlled by external cues while some are maintained using circadian rhythms.  These internal, self-sustained clocks with a periodicity of about 24 hours allow microbes, animals and plants to anticipate and prepare for daily fluctuations.  Recently, self-regulated clocks composed of one or a few proteins have been discovered, suggesting that genes for a robust clock can be readily acquired.  Thus far, true bacterial clockworks have been characterized only in phototrophs (that harvest energy from sunlight), but other bacteria would likely benefit from an internal clock.  Specifically gut microbes, with a clock that allows them to anticipate changes in host activities, would have an advantage over bacteria without a clock.  Shift workers often suffer intestinal discomfort and weight gain.  Gut microbes out of sync with their human host may be contributing to these unwanted physiological changes.  Uncovering a gut microbe circadian clock would inform targeted remedies to combat undesirable physiological changes that accompany our modern lifestyles.<br/><br/>To date, the complexity of gut microbial communities and lack of any readout for daily processes have hampered the ability to observe regular functions in most gut microbes.  To circumvent these issues, wild surgeonfish and their intestinal bacteria will be used as a natural model system to describe daily metabolic and developmental cycles.  One group of Firmicutes, Epulopiscium spp. and related epulos, are naturally occurring, abundant intestinal symbionts that produce conspicuous internal offspring once every 24 hours in a predictable process.  This provides a meter of everyday physiological changes in natural symbiont populations. Daily physicochemical changes in the intestinal ecosystem will be characterized to uncover regular fluctuations that may be used for entrainment.  Symbiont oscillations will be determined by analyses of their temporal transcriptome and the cyclical redox cycle of a widely distributed clock protein.  The project provides training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers.  An undergraduate Reciprocal Exchange Program will be developed to build a cooperative learning group that will contribute to the research project while building networks and skills for advanced training.  Native Pacific Islanders and other groups that are underrepresented in the sciences will be specifically recruited for these opportunities.

The build-up of this need is often urgent because sleep is crucial to many essential physiological processes including learning, memory formation and tissue repair. The increased sleep need is generated in the brain, presumably by a collection of neurons inter-connected via complex electrical and biochemical signals. This system of connected neurons is collectively known as the sleep homeostat. But despite the homeostat's central role in controlling sleep, very little is known about its structure, composition, and principles of operation. This research will construct a functional architecture of the homeostat by taking advantage of the fruit fly that, like humans, exhibits sleep but, owing to its relative simplicity offers a tractable system in which to dissect the homeostat. The proposed studies will develop a new series of genetic tools that will allow precise and controllable manipulations of the neurons and the interconnecting pathways suspected of forming the sleep homeostat. The experiments will be guided by a novel computational model developed by the PI. Results from the studies will constitute the first computational-molecular model of the sleep homeostat and will likely give rise to new testable hypotheses about the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. The interplay of mathematical modeling and genetics in the project will offer unique opportunities in interdisciplinary research and coursework for undergraduate and graduate students, with particular emphasis on involving members traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.   <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>This work will establish a model of the sleep homeostat, a feedback system that adjusts future sleep need based on past sleep, which is both mathematically rigorous and molecularly tractable. The project will exploit the fruit fly to build upon a recently developed theoretical model that suggests that four core biochemical pathways constitute the homeostat of the insect. Parameters of the model predict that neuromodulators such as dopamine and short neuropeptide F describe these pathways. A combination of behavioral, genetic and computational approaches will be employed to link the theoretical parameters to the neuromodulators, thus establishing the first quantitative model of the sleep homeostat with well-defined molecular identities. Objective 1 will examine the sleep-wake dynamics over- or under-expressing candidate neuromodulators to rapidly generate a short-list of neuromodulator pathways. Objective 2 will then use the Gal4/UAS system to target the neuromodulator-producing neurons, biochemically perturbing them by altering the abundance of the short-listed substrates. Objective 3 will overexpress ion channels to electrically perturb specific neuromodulator-expressing neurons and serve as a third independent test in the identification of neuromodulators that underlie fly sleep homeostasis. Together, these studies will lead to a unified, computational-molecular model of the homeostat and, in so doing, substantially broaden our understanding of the neural mechanisms governing sleep. Additionally, the computational and molecular approaches taken in the research will be incorporated into laboratory experiences for students, thus training future scientists in how to integrate mathematical and molecular approaches in the study of nervous system functions."

In spite of advances in treatment of microbial diseases, fungal diseases continue to pose an increasing threat to humans, animals, and plants that often endanger food security and human well-being. The last few decades, in particular, have seen an unprecedented increase in emerging infectious fungal diseases, while the continuous loss to microbial drug resistance of available chemistries for disease control, intensifies the problem and necessitates the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Key to this process is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms employed by microbes to infect their hosts. In this respect, alternative splicing (AS), a key element in eukaryotic gene expression by which different protein variants are generated from the same gene, is an unexplored feature of microbial pathogenicity which could promote microbial virulence by regulating the optimal production of virulence factors during infection. Thus, the project will focus on a systematic analysis of AS in plant pathogenic fungi, with an emphasis on deciphering its functional significance for parasitic infections. The findings will significantly advance our understanding of fungal pathogenesis and could be used for the development of novel therapeutic treatments for plant diseases through the pharmaceutical manipulation of fungal AS during infection of the host. The project will also be used as a basis for raising public awareness on infectious fungal diseases and training of a diverse student body in molecular plant sciences. <br/><br/>Most studies on fungal pathogenesis on plants have focused on the discovery and biochemical characterization of virulence factors that contribute to infections and disease, but much less attention has been placed on the epigenetic mechanisms that control transcriptome diversity of virulence-associated genes. AS splicing is perhaps the most crucial posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of gene expression but, despite its importance in generating proteome diversity and functional complexity in eukaryotic cells, its prevalence, biological role, and functional consequence for fungal pathogenicity have been barely studied. The goal in this project is to systematically identify and characterize AS events in plant pathogenic fungi during a complete infection cycle of their host, in order to provide critical answers to fundamental questions regarding its pervasiveness, species conservation, and contribution to microbial virulence. This area of study is important because regulated AS of virulence-associated genes is a relatively unexplored feature of microbial pathogenicity, which potentially enables microbes to quickly modulate and fine-tune interactions with their host. To achieve its goals, the project will integrate genome-wide transcriptome profiling, with selective detection of novel splice isoforms through targeted proteomics approaches, and functional analyses of candidate AS genes by RNAi-mediated isoform-specific gene targeting. To assess the generality of the findings, the analysis will be done in two phylogenetically related plant pathogenic fungi when infecting their common host. The successful completion of this project could trigger a paradigm-shift in the field of host-microbe interactions by highlighting the importance of AS-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in parasite fitness and virulence."

However, little is known about the extent of genetic variation that contributes to sorghum resistance or susceptibility to these insects. The goal of this project is to elucidate previously unknown sorghum resistance mechanisms to aphids in order to help design novel targets for pest control and reduce dependence on costly and harmful insecticides. The knowledge gained from this project identifies key genes, signaling networks, pathways, and/or regulatory mechanisms that underlie sorghum resistance to phloem-feeding insect pests. The broader impacts of the project include an innovative and comprehensive outreach/education program to understand plant resistance to insects by involving middle and secondary school teachers and middle school and undergraduate students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented groups, as they explore solutions to real-world situations involving concepts of plant resistance to insect pests. In addition, this project will provide multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral research associates in the areas of plant biology, genomics, and entomology.<br/><br/>The defense signaling networks underlying monocot crop resistance to aphids remain largely unknown, and this is especially true for sorghum. This project fills an important gap in current research by utilizing genomic resources to gain insight into the underlying genetic networks and phenotypic traits that contribute to sorghum resistance to aphids. Natural variation in a panel of sorghum inbred lines is used to elucidate the novel sources of sorghum resistance to sugarcane aphids. A combination of molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches enable a better understanding of the genetic basis of sorghum resistance to aphids. Four objectives are proposed: 1) characterization of SCA feeding behavior and the early physiological defense responses involved in sorghum resistance to aphids, 2) discovery of novel genes and the underlying transcriptional networks that contribute to sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, 3) determination of key defense metabolites in sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, and 4) development  and delivery of outreach and educational programs in plant insect interactions and plant defense for middle and secondary school teachers and middle students.

Giant clams evolved an elegant system for efficiently harvesting solar energy in areas of extremely high light intensity using algae adapted for much lower light intensities. They do this by arranging algae within their tissues into vertical pillars parallel to incoming sunlight. The surface of the tissue is covered by cells called iridocytes; these function to redistribute light incident on the horizontal surface of the clam tissue evenly over the much larger vertical surfaces of the algal micropillars. The project will explore the wealth of biophysical complexity in the system to understand exactly how the clam optimizes solar energy capture. PI Sweeney will characterize the clams' evolved structural responses to changing light environment over the lifetime of a clam and over evolutionary time as observed in differences between closely related clam species. Co-PI Yang will make new materials inspired by the clam by synthesizing top-down and bottom-up design and fabrication techniques to rival biology in hierarchical structural control. The clam's design will be especially useful for utilizing inexpensive polymer photovoltaics efficiently and with low photodamage in novel devices, and for improved photobioreactor technology. The project includes internships for college students from Palau and Philadelphia to provide pre-college students with cultural knowledge of scientific career paths and concrete lab experiences.<br/><br/>The PIs seek to turn new insights from this biophotonic symbiosis into transformative, high volume, low surface area, defect tolerant photovoltaic devices, and algal fuel culture systems.

Rapid environmental change may happen in many ways, such as the emergence of new pathogens and diseases, invasion by competing species, and shifts in temperature or other climatic conditions. Evolution, however, happens much more slowly because genetic mutations are rare and it takes many generations for favorable mutations to become common. This time delay results in a phenomenon called evolutionary lag, which is the difference between a population's ability to survive and reproduce currently and its ability to do so once favorable mutations have become common.

It will use an experimental approach with wild North American red squirrels to evaluate if elevations in maternal stress levels enable pregnant females to induce changes in the physiology, behavior, and reproductive characteristics of offspring that enable them to better survive altered environments. From a broader perspective, this will aid the understanding of how early life stress can alter the physiology and behavior of mammalian offspring and if these effects are long-lasting; both of these are crucial questions in biomedical studies of humans. The educational activities of the project include crafting novel assessment methods to evaluate the effectiveness of undergraduate teaching in the behavioral sciences, the design of a new first-year undergraduate course in animal behavior to increase the retention of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the STEM pipeline, and development of a new graduate course that integrates concepts from evolutionary biology and neuroscience to better understand the biological and cultural origins of differences between females and males. The project will also engage public stakeholders by providing new training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and developing new after-school activities for elementary-aged students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Plasticity in behavior and characteristics associated with growth, reproduction, and survival (life history traits) may allow animals to persist through changing environments. Parental effects are a type of trans-generational phenotypic plasticity where the parental phenotype or environment induces plasticity of offspring characteristics. Parental effects could allow adaptive adjustments in offspring phenotype in anticipation of specific environments. Alternatively, the long-lasting changes in offspring physiology caused by parental effects could inhibit adaptive responses to changing environments. The main aim of this project is to identify why and how parental effects orchestrate changes in offspring phenotypes in wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and determine whether they facilitate or constrain adaptation to changing environments. This project will use a series of field experiments combined with laboratory measures of physiological characteristics to address three specific knowledge gaps about parental effects: the mechanisms responsible for parental effects, their evolutionary consequences in nature, and how these consequences vary across environments and the sexes.  This work will expand educational opportunities for students at multiple levels and develop a novel assessment method for tracking the effectiveness of animal behavior education for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the mechanisms that provide spatial and temporal control over morphogenesis are conserved in all animals, yet knowledge is still lacking on how these processes work. For example, the current understanding of mechanisms that allow mechanical forces to propagate through a tissue is inadequate to fully explain morphogenesis in many developmental events. Thus investigating these control mechanisms in a simple model organism such as the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) provide understanding of basic developmental processes that are shared by all animals. The Ward lab has identified a number of proteins that appear to function together in several morphogenetic events during embryogenesis in the fly. This research focuses on the molecular functions of these proteins in generating and propagating mechanical forces through a tissue during embryogenesis. In addition to the scientific advancements that will result from this study, this project will increase the participation of first generation and underrepresented minority high school and college students in authentic scientific research. Specifically, the PI will develop a new program to engage high school students from Kansas City, KS in a summer-long research experience centered on using model system genetics to study development. The PI is also a mentor for several programs aimed at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences at the University of Kansas, including teaching a course on developing skills to apply to graduate school in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Morphogenetic events are triggered and controlled by developmentally-regulated signaling pathways that lead to actomyosin dynamics in individual cells. These forces must then be propagated through the epithelium and maintained in order to elicit appropriate tissue-level morphological changes. Although much is known about actomyosin dynamics, less is known about the cellular mechanisms involved in force propagation through a tissue. In preliminary studies, the PI determined that a large collection of genes that encode core septate junction (SJ) components are required for embryonic morphogenetic events in the fly. The SJ is a large protein complex that functions as an occluding junction. Importantly, the requirement for these genes occurs prior to the formation of the occluding junction, indicating a novel function for these proteins in morphogenesis. The overall goal of this project is to provide mechanistic understanding of how SJ proteins facilitate morphogenetic processes during dorsal closure (DC), a well-studied developmental event that occurs midway through Drosophila embryogenesis. The following aims will be addressed: (1) to determine if SJ proteins regulate the assembly and dynamics of actomyosin complexes during DC, (2) to determine if SJ proteins are required for biomechanical or adhesive functions during DC, and (3) to determine if SJ proteins are required to maintain apical/basal polarity. Actomyosin dynamics will be examined by live imaging and on fixed tissues with antibodies that reveal activated myosin complexes, while biomechanical properties will be probed by laser microsurgery experiments."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal function is, in turn, a product of constraint, plasticity, adaptation, and other processes. Constraints can be ecological, evolutionary, developmental, or biomechanical. Thus, understanding complex phenotypes related to animal function requires an integrative approach. To accomplish this, the workshop will bring together a number of fields, from biologists focused on genomics and evolutionary ecology, to biomechanists. This workshop falls under the Rules of Life as it explores how complex phenotypes respond to ecological shifts, resulting in plastic and evolutionary responses. How this occurs is critical for determining if/how animals and plants will survive over the coming years. The results of this workshop will be shared with a broad audience (including the general public). The topic of the workshop will be highlighted as a main discussion topic for upper grades (8-12). In general, the theme of ""How Things Work and Why"" is interesting to young people.  The workshop seeks to stimulate curiosity so that future STEM scholars and professionals emerge. The focus on a diverse panel of participants will ensure that the scientific community is empowering the future of the field, selecting current and future leaders that will serve as role models for students from underrepresented groups in the sciences. In light of this, the participants are diverse. <br/><br/>The quest to understand the origin and ramifications of complex phenotypes has been a goal of evolutionary biologists for a considerable amount of time. However, a major gap in this quest is the incorporation of biomechanically relevant information to understand complex traits. This is despite the fact that functionally-mediated traits are likely critical for survival. Morphological traits have been used as proxies for biomechanical traits, but this has frequently been shown to be inadequate. In addition, ecological variables are key for understanding how organisms function in their environment.  This, in turn, is key for understanding evolutionary processes. What is needed to fully understand complex traits is the integration of ecology, biomechanics, and evolution. In terms of animal function, integration is persistent and important for the successful execution of tasks. How this relates to ecology is currently unknown. This workshop will bring together biomechanists, functional morphologists, evolutionary biologists, and ecologists to generate a paradigm for ecomechanics that will be the foundation for future research that will uncover key information regarding complex phenotypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this feat, plants had to adapt to the much harsher terrestrial environment in a variety of ways, including making specialized structures for anchoring in soil, gathering sunlight, and reproducing, as well as being able to sense and respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions. How early plants were able to do this remains largely unknown. The moss Physcomitrella patens is an excellent species in which to study plant adaption to land, since mosses are among the earliest-arising land plants.  P. patens also has a variety of properties that make it amenable to scientific study, including its small size, transparent cells, small amount of genetic material, ease of growth in the laboratory, and ease of manipulation using molecular tools. Moss lines have been developed that harbor mutations causing the plants to revert to single-celled organisms resembling green algae, the progenitor of land plants. These plants also are able to withstand dehydrating conditions better than normal moss plants. Studies of these mutants will give clues into how normal development of moss proceeds, but also what mechanisms early plants used to adapt to land. These studies also have implications for 1) developing crops that are better able to withstand drought, and 2) developing algae lines to be used in biofuel production that might be easier to harvest, by engineering individual algae cells that will stick together when prompted. <br/><br/>The moss mutants that will be examined are defective in protein prenylation, which is a post-translational modification that adds a lipid group to particular target proteins. This lipid group plays a role in targeting the protein to membranes and in protein-protein interactions. It was previously found that prenylation deficiencies in moss resulted in a lack of cell adhesion after cell division, along with a complete lack of cell differentiation. These moss mutants were also more sensitive to abscisic acid, which resulted in higher survivability under dehydrating conditions. The goals of the current project are threefold: 1) to generate additional mutants defective in various types of protein prenylation, 2) further determine the functional roles of prenylation in cell adhesion, cell fate determination, cell differentiation, cell polarity, and hormone responses, and 3) identify and examine the functional role of key prenylation target proteins in mediating cell adhesion and developmental processes. Studies of prenylation in moss will advance our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of many important plant processes of broad scientific interest. This project will provide training in a wide variety of experimental techniques, and will include extensive participation by students, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences."

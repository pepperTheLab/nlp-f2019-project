Growth in the availability of large environmental datasets has also resulted in the need for a diverse workforce with technical data science skills. A variety of organizations support individuals currently underrepresented in STEM that are interested in entering data science careers through training, mentoring, and networking opportunities. However, many of these initiatives have been developed in isolation, limiting opportunities for an exchange of ideas and lessons learned. The Battelle Memorial Institute and its partners will host a 3-day conference to strengthen initiatives across organizations to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented groups in data science careers. Conference attendees (with selected allied representatives from NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots) will be comprised of academic, training, and business partners that offer training and career opportunities in the data sciences; project leaders conducting research on recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in this and related fields; employers who have an interest in hiring and retaining a diverse data science workforce; and individuals with experience in mentoring interns and early career professionals in research and technical positions. The products of the conference will include a conference proceedings report; specific recommendations for filling the gaps in understanding the multiple career pathways of underrepresented groups in data-intensive environmental science careers; and a strategy for continued development and expansion of a collaborative community focused on increasing workforce diversity in the data sciences.<br/><br/>The Conversation IDEaS (Conversations on Inclusion in Data Science for Ecological and Environmental Sciences) Conference will be a 3-day conference with the ultimate goal of developing a networked improvement community (i.e., Environmental Data Sciences Inclusion Network) that strengthens initiatives across existing alliances and organizations to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented groups in data science careers. By establishing connections between existing organizations and alliances that are working towards a common goal, this conference will build their capacity to provide opportunities and remove barriers for underrepresented groups. Making special efforts to bring in collaborators that may not currently be known as potential stakeholders in these conversations will broaden the network's impact. The conference will be structured around three primary components of potential career pathways (awareness/recruitment, training, and retention/mentoring) at each of three possible entry points (K-12, higher education, career change/advancement).  The conference activities will be designed to address the following questions relevant to each day: (1) what is the problem we are trying to solve?; (2) what expertise is needed to solve the problem?; and (3) how might our network be structured to support our work? The products of the conference will include a conference proceedings report; specific recommendations to the INCLUDES network for filling the gaps in our understanding of the multiple career pathways of underrepresented groups in data-intensive ecological and environmental data science careers; and a strategy for continued development and expansion of the networked improvement community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One teaspoon of soil may contain over a billion bacteria, belonging to thousands of distinct species. These organisms play essential roles in cycling nutrients, decomposing organic matter, and determining the fate of pollutants released by human activities. This project will collect samples of microbes from thousands of sites across Wyoming that differ in their local climate, land use, and plant life. The samples will be analyzed to better understand the environmental roles of the microbes and their responses to changes in precipitation, soil properties, and land use. Species composition and ecological relationships to the ecosystem will be determined using DNA, RNA, and protein sequencing. Statistical methods will be used to uncover the relationships between microbes and how the overall ecosystems function. The results will help predict how different regions will respond to environmental disturbances and provide policy makers tools to better manage natural resources. The project will also train workers in how to handle the huge volumes of data generated by such research; these skills will be transferrable to many sectors of the Wyoming economy. Outreach efforts to Native American, Latino, and hearing-impaired students will promote diversification of the workforce trained in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>The overarching aims of this project are to advance process-based understanding of soil and freshwater microbiomes, to develop cutting-edge data-science training and research and development capacity in Wyoming, and to position the University of Wyoming as a national leader in microbial ecology and data science. To define the causal factors that determine microbial distributions, over nineteen thousand samples of soil-, water-, and plant-associated microbes will be collected and processed, taking advantage of environmental gradients that exist across the state. Samples will be studied using a variety of ?omic? (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic) and biogeochemical technologies, including enzymatic assays and stable isotope probing. Relationships between microbial life and ecological consequences will be modeled and tested by statistical and experimental means. Investments in equipment infrastructure, inter-disciplinary training for diverse students and postdocs, and new faculty hires will enhance the research capacity of Wyoming. The focus on data science training will serve the technology workforce needs of Wyoming and benefit the state economy."

This supply is under increasing pressures from population growth, economic development, and climate change. Effective management of water resources requires detailed understanding of the underground geologic features that determine the flow paths of subsurface water; these features are particularly complex in Hawaii due to its volcanic origins and history. This project will greatly improve understanding of where the water that provides for the needs of Hawaii?s cities, farms, and industries comes from and how to ensure a continued, high quality supply. The project team will engage and collaborate with federal, state, and local agencies and community groups concerned with water management. Training and education initiatives will prepare a diverse workforce capable of meeting the research and policy-making challenges of the future.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>The overarching scientific goal of this project is to generate more accurate and detailed models of Hawaii?s aquifers, water flow, and transport processes. Geophysical imaging will be used to produce high-resolution 3D maps of subsurface geologic structures. Aquifer volume, flow, and connectivity will be measured by well monitoring, geochemical and submarine groundwater discharge analyses, and the use of microbial diversity as a novel groundwater tracer. The project will also establish the Integrated Knowledge Environment, a centralized cyberinfrastructure platform for data storage, high performance computation, numerical modeling, and visualization. This resource will include data from the project as well as legacy and new data from governmental agency collaborators, and will serve as a tool for both research and water management decision support. The modeling tools and knowledge gained through this project will be extensible to other volcanic Pacific islands. The project will provide training in geophysics, hydrology, and data science to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, and also provide career development mentoring to these groups and junior faculty. Emphasis will be placed on the recruitment and retention of women and under-represented minorities, particularly Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders."

The project studies the intersection of human, climate, water, agriculture, and energy systems in the Blue Nile Basin (BNB) of Ethiopia. The main objective of the project is to study and improve decision making under uncertainty. The project interweaves social science, geosciences and engineering research to create new models for water forecasting, then uses these models to understand the political-institutional constraints that affect how communities and decision-makers consider and use scientific information. Since decision-makers globally are faced with the challenge of using data and models that are never completely certain, an understanding of how political-institutional constraints impact use of scientific data will have global ramifications. Performing this research in Ethiopia is especially valuable since Ethiopia's inter-annual variability in local precipitation is one of the highest globally and Ethiopia's socio-political challenges in water management are mirrored in many other developing countries. Therefore, improved water modeling methods developed for the BNB have the potential to be valuable globally, and improved understanding of the political and institutional impacts on water management in the BNB can be applied to other environments with a potentially transformational impact around the globe. <br/><br/>This project will develop hydro-climatic forecasts from data-enhanced models and incorporate social science data that will improve the predictability of sub-basin hydro-agricultural and water management processes in the BNB. A three-stage longitudinal design captures the changing links between new scientific information, political-institutional dynamics, and water, agricultural and energy activities. The project uses a comparative design method to harness and understand variation in both human and natural systems, investigating iteratively how each aspect of the coupled system influences human security in vulnerable hydro-climatic environments. The research proposed provides a novel mechanism to test the traditional understanding of ""pure"" science against a political-institutional model that acknowledges the role of social factors in the use of scientific information. The research will provide a better understanding of how people respond to scientific uncertainty with implications well beyond Ethiopia and the Blue Nile Basin. The project will integrate research, education and outreach, bringing people and resources together across disciplinary, cultural and geographical boundaries. Key likely benefits include: developing a practical roadmap for developing and using water forecasting in low income communities; training a new cadre of US students capable of interdisciplinary and international work on water and human security, and providing e-learning and outreach that will carry this training beyond the students participating in this project; and global public outreach to share the results of this project with scientists as well as many other stakeholders interested in understanding and managing water resources. The research effort aligns with NSF's emerging focus on food, energy, and water systems, and the results of this project are likely to benefit future efforts to understand the food, energy, and water nexus.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."

The research goal of this program is to characterize the status of Nosy Be Island's endangered and charismatic terrestrial and marine species and identify the threats driving their declines. The research team of local and international researchers will train undergraduate students from the US and Madagascar to use a variety of wildlife research methods and social science surveys. Using these acquired skills, students will generate critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial species, including primates (lemurs), sea turtles, and dolphins. During this 3-year project students will, along with mentor, develop an understanding of the drivers of wildlife declines and design sustainable programs to protect them.  Science-based management is particularly important in Madagascar because terrestrial and marine ecosystems are experiencing alarming rates of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction in the face of food security challenges to local human populations. This project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries to adapt field methods to research questions in the context of generating cost-effective data to achieve sustainable conservation goals. Most importantly, this program will produce cohorts of highly trained scientists in the field of conservation biology with a deep understanding of real-world challenges.<br/><br/>Generating baseline ecological data on rare and charismatic endangered species is critical for conservation and wildlife management, particularly in data-poor areas where conflicts between human activities and biodiversity are acute. All research projects will address at least one of three objectives: (1) assess the critical habitats and density trends of six endangered flagship species, including three lemurs, one species of cetacean and one species of sea turtle, (2) investigate the environmental drivers of their abundance and their decline, and (3) assess the impact of potential mitigation measures. Each cohort of students (6 students per year) will base their research questions on the findings of previous cohorts, enabling us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes of decline and measures to preserve Nosy Be's wildlife. This research and professional development program has four stages: 1) pre-field training at Florida International University, 2) data collection in Madagascar, 3) data-analysis and reporting at FIU and 4) future-cohort input and supervision where students will share their experiences and support new cohorts. During field activities, students will be trained to 1) use standard methods to rapidly assess the conservation status of endangered species in the field and 2) use a combination of field and social science survey methods to conduct animal assessments. During class activities students will be trained to 1) write research proposals and field protocols, 2) use advanced statistical methods to analyze field data, 3) write technical and non-technical publications, 4) do oral presentations of their research, and 5) collaborate and mentor other students. Ultimately, this research program will provide critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar, and will provide students with key research and conservation skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improved constraints on the distribution of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes. We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.  <br/><br/>2. We will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c) using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  <br/><br/>3. We will investigate the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.<br/><br/>During each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in the country. Students will collect new data and perform basic data processing and analysis tasks while in Costa Rica, and will develop individualized research projects over the course of subsequent academic year, when they will be enrolled in a university-wide Aresty Research Assistantship program."

Data collected through Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, such as remote sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have the potential to contribute to global data hubs. However, most IoT applications and their data structures are designed to solve local problems, such as crop protection and local food shortage predictions. This IRES SITTE project will train 18 U.S. master's students in multicriteria design of and policies for IoT systems with the aim of making local IoT data available to global data scientists. <br/><br/>The project involves collaborations with professors/mentors at University of Rwanda and Carnegie Mellon Africa, both in Kigali, Rwanda, the former of which serves as the Center of Excellence for IoT under the World Bank's Eastern and Southern Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program. Through the collaboration, students will receive interdisciplinary research training in wireless networks, software engineering, policy studies and sociotechnical systems. This interdisciplinary training will enable designs of low cost IoT systems, usable in a range of contexts, including the U.S., while increasing access to data by biology/agriculture and forced migration scientists. The training will also enhance students' as well as the project's advisory board, consisting of academic scientists and an industry innovation professional, on information and communication technology (ICT) innovations systems in East Africa, expanding global perspectives within the U.S. IT workforce.<br/><br/>Fulfilling the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ongoing systems innovation to incorporate advances in foundational technologies, lower costs, and fulfill the needs of global data scientists. Designing systems for integration of sensor-derived local data into global scientific data platforms, such as the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) hub and the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Migration Data Portal, can simultaneously inform local, regional and global challenges of socioeconomic and environmental development. <br/>This IRES Site Program pursues novel IoT research. The interdisciplinary research combines complementary wireless network, software engineering, policy studies, and sociotechnical systems expertise of the three mentors and the PI.  The program consists of three projects, two technical and one focused on policy analysis. <br/><br/>The first technical project involves unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones) designed for collecting data from refugee gardens. Using cameras, the UAVs collect image data processed through a Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), a standard approach for vegetation monitoring. The UAV will also be controlled by software to optimize its path-planning, enhancing both coverage i.e. canvassing the target area, and network connectivity.  The second technical project targets device-to-device communications (D2D) for systems without access to a power grid, through innovations in hardware, software and data management systems, designed to improve crop information on tea estates.  A third project focuses on IoT policy analyses at national and organizational levels. The analyses will highlight current trends in Rwandan IoT use, system vulnerabilities, as well as national and organizational policies that may affect data sharing practices and hinder access by Big Data scientists.<br/><br/>This IRES Site Program develops interdisciplinary and creative information technology professionals capable of solving multi-criteria design problems. Through intellectually challenging yet appropriately scoped projects, master's students are exposed to international innovation systems and gain insights into the culture of East Africa. The program's design includes both pre-departure and follow-on courses, insuring effective student preparation and widespread dissemination of results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project brings together researchers from the Kansas State University, Oklahoma State University, and Langston University (a Historically Black University), to develop a new way to model and predict important crop production traits in wheat.  One of the greatest challenges of current crop trait prediction is that it falls in an underpopulated borderland between plant physiology, biological engineering, genetics, computational biology, mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Therefore, to bridge this gap, mathematical models will be produced that combine both observational data using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and robots, and genetics data.  These new models are expected to simplify crop modeling for farmers, and will aid in farm management, and can easily be applied to other crops and in other environments.  Many additional benefits will also accrue.  First, commonalities between these mathematical models will mean that results will readily transfer to many other crops. Moreover, the benefits of combining genetic and observational data in this way to predict crop traits will aid on-farm crop management, enhancing food security.  Educational programs for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in these disciplines will enlarge a globally competitive workforce. Involvement of key corporate partners will also speed research transfer to the private sector both directly and by creating a market for project trainees.

Farmers need genetically-informed analytics to predict the outcomes of management options amongst which they may choose and apply in their unique field environments. This project brings together researchers from the sity of Kansas State University, Oklahoma State University, and Langston University (a Historically Black University), and presents new genetically- and physiologically-informed proof-of-concept wheat physiologically-based crop models (CMs).  These CMs will link to state-of-the-art field monitoring technologies with genomic data, thus rebalancing direct monitoring vs. indirect model calculation.  The data will include: (1) airborne imagery to extract morphological features, canopy temperatures, and light interception. (2) Multivariate soil profile data will be collected by robots at 2-30 cm (horizontal/vertical) and three-day temporal resolution.  (3) Gene expression data on selected double haploid lines over 64 combinations of locations, dates, and years will aid in model building. (4) CM and quantitative genetics integration will also be aided by expanding the number of genotyped wheat lines within the Kansas and Oklahoma breeding programs.  Such large data sets ordinarily pose computational challenges for models as complex as CMs.  In contrast to extant CMs, the new models will efficiently combine differential equation solvers, maximum entropy and Bayesian methods, and high-performance computing.  The results will be methods able to predict the traits of novel genotypes in novel environments not used to construct the models. Many additional benefits will also accrue.  First, commonalities between CMs will mean that results will readily transfer to many other crops. Moreover, increased genome to phenome prediction accuracy will aid on-farm crop management, enhancing food security.  Educational programs for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in these disciplines will create and enlarge a globally competitive workforce.

Materials that exhibit electron correlations also exhibit intriguing properties, such as metal-insulator transitions and unconventional superconductivity.  However, whether electron correlation is the sole cause of these observed effects has perplexed scientists for decades. Overcoming this gap in knowledge could open up revolutionary opportunities for novel transistor and ultrafast device applications. In this project, the PI will use the supercomputing capabilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to tackle this challenging problem. Advanced simulations will be performed using tens of thousands of computing processors to model the behavior of electron correlation systems at the atomic scale. The research will generate more than 100 terabytes of data, requiring that Big Data techniques be employed to effectively process and analyze the huge data volume. The project includes efforts to broaden participation in the next-generation scientific computing workforce.  The research topics address several of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments and the Grand Challenges in Basic Energy Sciences, thereby also having potential impacts on U.S. science leadership and an energy-sustainable future.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The project's focus is on modeling quantum many-body phenomena driven away from equilibrium, with the goal of understanding correlated electrons' non-equilibrium behaviors revealed by time-domain spectroscopies at ultra-short time scales. Matrix diagonalization over 100 billion basis states will be tackled by matrix-free and dataflow computing. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium wavefunction-based quantum impurity solvers also will be developed. Non-linear time series regression will be further implemented to alleviate the computational cost for time-evolution calculations. The resulting codes will be employed to simulate ultrafast photon-based spectroscopies on vanadium dioxide (VO2), using effective single-band Hubbard model and multi-orbital Hamiltonian from Wannier projection. The role of structure transition will be addressed by restricted phonon calculations. These simulations could significantly advance the understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena and photo-induced phase transitions in VO2 and other strongly correlated transition-metal oxides. Open-source softwares also will be made freely available to the public for parallel cloud computing to further benefit the scientific community for numerical studies of non-equilibrium many-body problems."

Machine learning is revolutionizing the way these data are observed. As a merger between statistics and computer science, the techniques of machine learning have been used for decades, but recent improvements in high-performance computing, and research investment from the commercial sector have supercharged the utility of these methods. Environmental scientists have been relatively slow to take up these new methods, in part because the rapid pace of discovery makes it difficult to stay at the cutting edge, but as scientific datasets grow ever larger and more complex, it is becoming increasingly important to make use of machine learning as a way to explore and understand the world. In collaboration with colleagues at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the PI aims to stimulate progress in oceanography and genomics by bringing cutting edge tools and techniques from the world of machine learning to Alaska. Acquiring these skills in parallel with an early career scientist, and applying them to ongoing research projects in the Arctic, will enable a substantially improved understanding of ongoing changes in the marine ecosystems of Alaska. Passing on this knowledge to students by designing and teaching a new course on Machine Learning in the Environmental Sciences will ensure that future generations of Alaskans have access to the skills they will need to succeed in science and beyond.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The broad goals of this visit are to advance machine learning in biological oceanography through interdisciplinary collaborations and knowledge transfer. The PI aims to leverage extensive expertise at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) to advance research on Arctic marine microbial communities using machine learning methods. The WHOI Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (WARP) Lab specializes in adaptive sampling, marine robotics, computer vision, autonomous robotic exploration, semantic perception, bayesian nonparametrics, deep learning, surprise detection, and data summarization. Objectives of this project include learning the theory and concepts of machine learning in structured and informal settings, which include several common programming languages and toolkits. Using this base, the PI and a graduate trainee will apply the tools and techniques of machine learning to predict spatiotemporal distributions of Arctic marine microbes, their use and transformations of metals, and advance biological oceanographic sampling techniques.  The PI will accomplish this effort by designing methods for adaptive biological sampling using flow-through systems and ocean profilers. Outcomes of the project will include the development of a new course on Machine Learning in the Environmental Sciences to be taught at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and online via the University of the Arctic. Career development and mentorship of the graduate student will include training in computing fluency in the Software Carpentry program and subsequent training as an instructor.

Not only are infants and young children open to new learning, but older children, young adults, and even older adults are open to new experience that changes their brains and behavior. The broad PIRE network of partnerships will enable investigations in contexts where the form  of language  learning  and  language  contact  differ from the environments that have typically informed research to date. The PIRE will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to conduct translational research across three broad themes: (1) Language learning across the life span; (2) The role of instructional approaches for successful learning outcomes; and (3) The impact of diverse social environments for language learning. The planned research will exploit a range of behavioral, neuroscience, and field methods to identify readiness and need for intervention, to track learning  in real time, and to assess new  learning outcomes."

To do this, students will examine the fitness consequences of inherited genetic, ecological and social traits in wild bottlenose dolphins in collaboration with scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast GenEcology Research Centre in Queensland, Australia and in the field at the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Shark Bay, Australia. Students will contribute to one of the most comprehensive and detailed long-term studies of a wild mammal in an exciting intellectual, cultural, and physical environment. At the core of this work is trying to understand how genetic, social and ecological factors shape evolutionary processes and fitness. By focusing on well-known dolphins, students can broadly investigate how genetic diversity maps onto variation in social and ecological patterns. Such individual variation is increasingly recognized for its importance in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, to date, data on how such variations in social behavior and ecology are transmitted, and how they interact with genetic background are limited. Understanding this relationship is crucial, particularly for species that show high levels of variation like bottlenose dolphins. Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins have well-documented social and ecological variation; some individuals are highly social while others live rather solitary lives; some use all habitats, while others specialize in one or two, with similar variation in home range size and foraging tactics. Lifetime fitness variation is substantial, where 24.3% of females do not produce surviving calves. In this study, students will draw on our longitudinal data and collect new data to empirically address their own research questions regarding the relationship between sociality, ecology, and genetic heritage.<br/><br/>This project was funded by the IRES program of NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)."

Cosmic transients are energetic flashes of light that are millions to billions of times the brightness of the sun, e.g. explosive deaths of massive stars, white dwarf detonations, exotic neutron star mergers and tidal disruption by black holes. Key follow-up observations of fast-fading or fast-moving events must occur at night promptly after discovery but before the sun rises. A relay of telescopes spanning multiple longitudes on earth will pass the baton amongst each other to effectively extend the night-time darkness. GROWTH will enable detailed monitoring of events that would otherwise vanish before the next night?s observations could begin at any single location. The torrent of data thus generated shall be used to improve both astronomical observing techniques and big data management and analysis (such as machine learning algorithms, database design and statistics). In addition, the intrinsically international context of the GROWTH program shall foster the development of relationships and social capital required to navigate effectively among diverse science cultures from around the world. Therefore, participating students will have the quantitative, computational and interpersonal skills to assume leadership roles in the knowledge economy. <br/><br/>GROWTH will address several frontier questions in time domain astronomy systematically. GROWTH aims to characterize the electromagnetic emission from binary neutron star mergers, thereby localizing the prime source of gravitational waves expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Timely spectroscopy may identify the long sought cosmic location of heavy element production. GROWTH would track small near-earth asteroids of the type that may pose hazards, to characterize their orbit, size, type and rotation properties. GROWTH shall have a front-row seat to observe the end points of stellar evolution by routinely obtaining data in the first 24 hours of a new-born supernova and directly probing the chemistry and history of the progenitor star. The GROWTH education program will train students and postdocs and encompass undergraduate course development, international internships, annual workshops and a research conference. GROWTH will thus help the US and international community prepare for the era of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (starting 2022), NSF's highest priority ground-based astronomy project for the next decade."

The students will develop, produce and evaluate paper-based devices used to test pharmaceutical quality and water quality. The primary goal of the project is to help students become more passionate about the power of science and engineering to solve global challenges while also developing valuable analysis and design skills. The project is led by principal investigator (PI) Dr. Toni Barstis of St. Mary's College, with co-PIs Dr. Reena Lamichhane Khadka and Dr. Donald Paetkau also of St. Mary's, and Dr. Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame. The international mentors are Dr. Basant Giri of the Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences in Nepal, and Dr. Beatrice Jakait and Dr. Sonak Pastakia of the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program (AMPATH) in Kenya. <br/><br/>Estimates suggest that in developing countries such as Nepal and Kenya up to 30% of the medicines are falsified or substandard and up to 90% of the water sources may be contaminated with bacteria. However, most tests used in the U.S. to evaluate water or pharmaceutical purity are too complicated for use in developing countries, requiring steady power sources, ultrapure water or other expensive materials. The paper-based assays that this project will develop and evaluate are low-cost, require only small volumes of liquid, use readily available materials, and require no power source. The devices and this training have potential value anywhere a cheap, easy to use testing method is needed. Through this project U.S. students will have the opportunity to build competency as global scientists and engineers by developing collaborative relationships with students and research mentors in Nepal and Kenya, and seeing how their scientific knowledge can make a difference in communities. Applicants will be primarily chosen from St. Mary's College, an all-women liberal arts college, and from alumni of a Notre Dame REU that targeted students from primarily undergraduate institutions and included many women, first generation-to-attend-college students and underrepresented minorities, providing strong potential for this project to include a diverse range of student participants. <br/><br/>Three cohorts of U.S. students will conduct research in the summers of 2017-2019 to develop paper-based, milli-fluidic analytical devices (PADs) to analyze pharmaceuticals and drinking water. Students will design and field-test the devices, comparing the outcomes from the PADs with ""gold standard"" analytical methods including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). Students will work at sites in Nepal and Kenya, where previous international collaborations by the PIs have laid the groundwork for safe living and working conditions for the participants and where the students can make genuinely useful contributions to ongoing projects led by the Nepali and Kenyan mentors. U.S. students traveling to Nepal and Kenya will first work together at their home institutions designing and manufacturing PADs, while in electronic contact with their international mentors and the international students who will be part of the research teams. The U.S. students will then spend at least four weeks in their respective country collecting samples, conducting field and lab testing, engaging in cultural activities, and meeting with experts and community members impacted by the research. Students will also be in electronic contact with the other country group to compare data and experiences during the time abroad. The summer program will conclude at the home institutions with further analyses and data validation, presentation locally and with international students electronically, and report preparation for presentation to the appropriate country agencies. Users of the research results may include: WHO RapidAlert Network, the Nepali Department of Drug Administration, the Nepal Water Supply Corporation, UNICEF-Nepal, and the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board."

The students will develop, produce and evaluate paper-based devices used to test pharmaceutical quality and water quality. The primary goal of the project is to help students become more passionate about the power of science and engineering to solve global challenges while also developing valuable analysis and design skills. The project is led by principal investigator (PI) Dr. Toni Barstis of St. Mary's College, with co-PIs Dr. Reena Lamichhane Khadka and Dr. Donald Paetkau also of St. Mary's, and Dr. Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame. The international mentors are Dr. Basant Giri of the Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences in Nepal, and Dr. Beatrice Jakait and Dr. Sonak Pastakia of the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program (AMPATH) in Kenya. <br/><br/>Estimates suggest that in developing countries such as Nepal and Kenya up to 30% of the medicines are falsified or substandard and up to 90% of the water sources may be contaminated with bacteria. However, most tests used in the U.S. to evaluate water or pharmaceutical purity are too complicated for use in developing countries, requiring steady power sources, ultrapure water or other expensive materials. The paper-based assays that this project will develop and evaluate are low-cost, require only small volumes of liquid, use readily available materials, and require no power source. The devices and this training have potential value anywhere a cheap, easy to use testing method is needed. Through this project U.S. students will have the opportunity to build competency as global scientists and engineers by developing collaborative relationships with students and research mentors in Nepal and Kenya, and seeing how their scientific knowledge can make a difference in communities. Applicants will be primarily chosen from St. Mary's College, an all-women liberal arts college, and from alumni of a Notre Dame REU that targeted students from primarily undergraduate institutions and included many women, first generation-to-attend-college students and underrepresented minorities, providing strong potential for this project to include a diverse range of student participants. <br/><br/>Three cohorts of U.S. students will conduct research in the summers of 2017-2019 to develop paper-based, milli-fluidic analytical devices (PADs) to analyze pharmaceuticals and drinking water. Students will design and field-test the devices, comparing the outcomes from the PADs with ""gold standard"" analytical methods including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). Students will work at sites in Nepal and Kenya, where previous international collaborations by the PIs have laid the groundwork for safe living and working conditions for the participants and where the students can make genuinely useful contributions to ongoing projects led by the Nepali and Kenyan mentors. U.S. students traveling to Nepal and Kenya will first work together at their home institutions designing and manufacturing PADs, while in electronic contact with their international mentors and the international students who will be part of the research teams. The U.S. students will then spend at least four weeks in their respective country collecting samples, conducting field and lab testing, engaging in cultural activities, and meeting with experts and community members impacted by the research. Students will also be in electronic contact with the other country group to compare data and experiences during the time abroad. The summer program will conclude at the home institutions with further analyses and data validation, presentation locally and with international students electronically, and report preparation for presentation to the appropriate country agencies. Users of the research results may include: WHO RapidAlert Network, the Nepali Department of Drug Administration, the Nepal Water Supply Corporation, UNICEF-Nepal, and the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board."

The project combines research on solar thermal energy generation with the understanding of eco-hydrological impacts of solar installation in desert regions to advance the economic and eco-friendly viability of solar electricity generation.  This combination distinguishes this project from several other existing solar energy projects, thus making it a unique model study of relevance to Nevada and other solar installations in the US and around the world.  The major participating institutions in this project are: the University of Nevada, Reno, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute.  Faculty and students from the College of Southern Nevada, Truckee Meadows Community College, and Nevada State College will also be engaged in this project.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Despite plentiful sunlight and cloud-free days which are conducive for solar energy collection, arid regions experience frequent dust storms and receive little or no rain.  Dust accumulated on solar panels absorb sunlight and decrease the efficiency of solar cells; water scarcity increases the cost of meeting the cooling needs of solar thermal collectors.  This project seeks to develop engineering/technological solutions to repel dust and minimize water usage in large solar installations.  In addition, it examines the desert ecosystem responses and provides science-based information for designing effective ways to manage and mitigate environmental impacts associated with large-scale solar installations.  The award establishes a research facility, called the Nevada Environment, Water, and Solar Testing and Research Facility (NEW-STAR) during this project.  Enhancements to the existing cyberinfrastructure capabilities are effected through the creation of the Nevada Research Data Center (NRDC) for data management and communication.  These new facilities promote collaboration among teams of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers on solar-energy-water-environment nexus research and education theme.    <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project has the potential to develop less costly and thus more competitive solar electricity generation techniques aimed at minimizing both water usage and environmental degradation.  The technological solutions to be developed are applicable to other solar energy installations nationally and globally.  Interactions among scientists and collaboration at regional, national, and international levels as well as partnerships with energy industry and environmental agencies in Nevada are expected to promote economic development in the state.  The project involves 41 faculty, 24 technicians, 43 graduate students, and 38 undergraduate students as participants.  The project offers the following programs aimed at pre-college and undergraduate students with a focus to attract underrepresented minority groups, K-12 teachers, and the general public: (1) Pre-college bridging programs to assist K-12 students to develop academic skills and career pathways; (2) Undergraduate research opportunity programs (UROP) to provide research experience at the solar energy-water-environment nexus; (3) Undergraduate and graduate hands-on training (HOT) to facilitate transition from student to professional; activities include industry internships and laboratory experiences in solar energy technology, and proposal writing workshops; (4) Teacher professional development programs that engage K-12 teachers in research, field work, and working with graduate students; (5) programs to educate K-12 students on project related themes and inform their families of opportunities for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers; and (6) Online learning laboratories, which provide wireless access to cyber learning materials and enhance public understanding of solar energy and related impacts on water and environment."

To curb this unprecedented loss of biological diversity, it is critical to understand how organisms respond to and persist in such rapidly-changing environments. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will explore how natural populations survive the challenges of their natural environment, and then leverage this understanding to determine how the same populations respond to novel human-mediated changes. This IRES project, therefore, will provide insights needed to slow the current, unprecedented loss of biodiversity.<br/><br/>This IRES project will train cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities), for a period of six weeks each year in field research and conservation science in the remote Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands serve as an ideal setting for this IRES project, as the archipelago is composed of dynamic ecosystems where organisms face constantly-changing conditions caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. An international team from the University of Miami and local non-government organizations will lead the program, offering diverse perspectives and unique expertise to create a thriving environment for student mentorship. The major goal is for students to first leverage natural systems by executing group experiments that explore how populations meet the challenges of their natural environment. Students will then expand on this understanding of natural systems by developing independent projects to test how the same populations respond to human-mediated disturbances. A follow-up course in the US will provide additional training and career development, with the goal of publishing the student projects. The result is an IRES program where a diverse, international team will equip the next generation of scientists with a more global perspective to tackle our planet's most pressing challenges.<br/><br/>This IRES project has two major broader impacts. First, this project will train undergraduate students in international research and conservation, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities). This IRES project will therefore tackle the lack of diversity in STEM, and provide international experience that is critical for preparing students to compete in a global market. Second, this IRES project will help establish conservation initiatives in a biodiversity hotspot. The conservation initiative includes students working with local stakeholders in collecting field data and conducting outreach to empower local communities in establishing sustainable practices. By collecting baseline data, students involved in this IRES project will help in the establishment of an ambitious conservation area. This IRES project, therefore, addresses a fundamental question in Biology, while providing students with experience in initiating impactful conservation programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute significantly to enhancing expertise and developing the next generation of researchers studying sponges, jellyfish, comb jellies, corals, and sea anemones. These animals are key to understanding the origin of animals and they also play vital roles in marine ecosystems. A series of 3 workshops held in Panama will allow international experts to train these US graduate students and some foreign students in the methods used to collect, identify, and understand these fragile organisms. Staging this training at a field station with access to highly diverse marine habitats will ensure that trainees gain exposure to the greatest diversity of animals and habitats possible. Trainees will become proficient in the skills necessary to document biodiversity, and some trainees will be involved in describing new species. Such skills are vital for providing data for conservation decisions and for various aspects of biosecurity. The project will provide follow-up, in-depth international research training for 6 US trainees. This project will address the current shortage of researchers skilled in applying taxonomic and systematic methods to sponges, jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. <br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to train the next generation of researchers working on sponges, jellyfish, comb jellies and corals by exposing them to tropical biodiversity and by focusing on the methods and approaches that can help resolve the relationships within and among these groups of animals. Conceptually, this project focuses on two major challenges in understanding biodiversity: (1) documenting global biodiversity and (2) determining the relationships within and among animal groups.  Taxonomy, the science of finding, describing and naming organisms, is vital to all biological research and to understanding and conserving biodiversity. The on-going effort to survey, inventory, and preserve the ocean's biological diversity is threatened by a shortage of taxonomic expertise. This project will train taxonomic experts in these groups who can document biodiversity, apply novel methods to help resolve the relationships between these groups, and ultimately understand the origins of animal life. This effort will also promote conservation of marine animals, which are poorly documented compared to terrestrial organisms. This project will support three 21-day workshops in 2019, 2020 and 2021, mixing US and international experts and trainees at a tropical field station in Panama. These workshops will (1) train participants in methods for identification; (2) include in-depth lectures and discussion on information and data relevant to understanding phylogenetic relationships among the groups; (3) broaden trainee perspectives on each group by providing hands-on experience with tropical diversity and meaningful interactions with diverse international colleagues; (4) build lasting international collaborations to promote US biodiversity research and improve accessibility to international field locations. Each workshop will follow a common framework and will share parts of the curriculum common to the 3 groups.

Addressing these human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems as they contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate regulation, and filter pollutants from water and air. Despite their importance, current policies are still largely ineffective as indicated by continued significant tropical forest loss over the past several decades. This NSF International Research Experience for Students award will support U.S. student projects across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda to analyze how international variation in environmental policies influences land use practices and how these practices affect conservation outcomes related to forest condition and primate biology. By examining similar forests with different environmental policies and different forests with similar environmental policies, we will be able to evaluate the largescale effectiveness of conservation incentives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, alongside the effects of agricultural practices linked to deforestation, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Through this research program, underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies and Makerere University Biological Field Station. Students will work closely with local field assistants and communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange. At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and host country scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences. An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure. Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods. <br/><br/>Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities. Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation. Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks. However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas. As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives. Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations. Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1) To utilize international variation in environmental policies that integrate conservation and development objectives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, for an analysis of the effectiveness of conservation strategies for both protecting tropical forests and their primates and maintaining human livelihoods; and 2) To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences. To meet these objectives, 15 upper level undergraduate and early career graduate student projects will examine the extent to which differing economic and participatory incentives and agricultural practices influence conservation outcomes as measured by on the ground data collected on forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, biomass) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, and population size) across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda. At these sites, students will survey primate populations using line transects, quantify differences in primate behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays, conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, government officials and other stakeholders, and quantify forest characteristics using GIS and field methods. Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how these effects influence local perception of environmental policy. Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic and participatory incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes. As a breakdown in socio-environmental systems will negatively affect both humans and biodiversity, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually meeting their sustainability and conservation goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

US students will work in collaborative teams with scientists from UMBC and the Bahamas to study the critically endangered Bahama Oriole. Six students per year will work with mentors doing international research in the Bahamas, followed by data analysis and presentation back at UMBC. These projects will enable students to develop deep understanding of a range of topics in environmental science related to island ecosystems, extinction and climate dynamics. Island ecosystems have always been vulnerable to human impacts, and many island species are endangered or have become extinct. The islands of the Caribbean represent a biodiversity hotspot that is acutely threatened by climate variations. The Caribbean is home to fifteen endangered songbird species, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). The proposed student research experience is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) to determine the status of the Bahama Oriole and to understand how habitat and climate change may affect it.<br/><br/>In the current global extinction crisis, islands are especially vulnerable, and most endangered and extinct avian species are (or were) island species. The Bahama Oriole is now restricted to Andros, having been extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s. The likely threats facing the Bahama Oriole are typical for island species, ranging from introduced predators to anthropogenic habitat change. The impacts of climate change on endemic species in the Caribbean may be especially intense drying and warming are altering fire regimes while rising sea levels and increased hurricane intensity are causing forest mortality. The proposed student research projects address the full scope of these issues facing this critically endangered songbird. Teams of Bahamian and US mentors will together advise undergraduate students on a series of independent research projects. One UMBC PhD student will be continually on-site in the Bahamas to help mentor the students. Student projects will teach the students skills that can be applied in a range of STEM careers. Project topics include 1) population ecology (e.g., estimating population size), 2) remote sensing (e.g., effects of climate change on pine habitat), and 3) predation (e.g., radio tracking to study annual survival). Recently, the research team conducted two pilot trips with diverse teams of students from UMBC and The Bahamas. These student-led efforts confirmed the feasibility of these projects and demonstrated how little is known about the Bahama Oriole.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For each of the three years of this IRES project, cohorts of four U.S. science and engineering students will expand their global competence through a well-integrated, eight-week international research and educational experience in the Czech Republic. Principal Investigator Chittaranjan Ray (UNL), along with lead counterparts Michal Snhota and Martin Sanda (CTU), will serve as mentors.  In their collaboration with CTU scientists and students, U.S. participants will jointly conduct hypothesis-driven laboratory experiments and field investigations designed to characterize water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils with macro pores (large pores due to wormholes, cracks etc.) at site-to-watershed scale in the Czech Republic.  The U.S. students will learn about creative, original, and potentially transformative methods the Czechs are using to study the fate and transport of water and contaminants through the unsaturated zone, particularly in terms of preferential flow.  New research results and knowledge of novel technologies being used in Europe will be shared in the U.S. through this project, thereby contributing to the development of a more globally engaged science workforce as well as to the sustainability of valuable water resources which affect economic competitiveness both domestically and internationally.<br/><br/>U.S. IRES participants will collaborate with the Czech researchers to evaluate the utility and accuracy of these new methods, which promise to significantly expand scientific understanding of vadose zone processes. These are considered critical to protecting and preserving ground water resources. As the ""skin"" of the earth, the vadose zone, or the unsaturated zone, regulates various functions like water percolation and contaminant attenuation, among others. Over the course of their IRES research abroad, U.S. students will learn about and use new technologies and methods developed in Europe.  Understanding flow and transport processes in the vadose zone is a key to identifying ground water pollution potential and to developing mitigation strategies.  IRES participants also will work with Czech partners to evaluate the utility and accuracy of innovative Czech technologies used to study water flow at different scales. Their findings are expected to materially contribute data about the correlation of small-scale measurements of soil properties to watershed processes.  Overall, the IRES experience is intended to encourage a diverse group of undergraduate participants to pursue graduate education in STEM fields.  The U.S. students will be encouraged to publish and to share their experiences via the UNL-maintained IRES website and through presentations at appropriate professional meetings, such as meetings of the American Society of Engineering Education."

The Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence (DAWN, established 2018), an international research center in Copenhagen, Denmark, brings together scholars whose interests span a broad range of observational and theoretical inquiries into Cosmic Dawn. Their expertise, together with Copenhagen's beautiful and enriching setting, make DAWN an ideal host for budding US scholars. We will create the DAWN-IRES Scholars Program to empower future generations of US scientists through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of visiting Copenhagen to immerse themselves into this vibrant international research center. The DAWN-IRES scholars will join a cohort of 7 student researchers in a stimulating 10-week science program that merges research using next-generation telescopes with life in a thousand-year-old city. The program's structure will encourage students to build learning communities within their cohorts, equipping them with practical research and communication skills. At the same time, the international exposure and access to cutting-edge resources will help maintain US leadership within the global astronomical community.<br/><br/>Students will lead observational and/or theoretical projects that contribute towards understanding some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: What caused the reionization of the Universe?  How do the first, massive galaxies form?  What is the origin of galaxy scaling relations? What quenches star formation in massive galaxies?  Over the next decade, the center's mission is to develop and test a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of the earliest galaxies through to the present day. The DAWN-IRES Scholars will join this thriving international research network, bridging the world class research performed by the US-based associate faculty coordinating this program with the DAWN permanent faculty and the local program coordinator.

Over a three year period, fourteen U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and three undergraduate students from the Monroe Community College Geospatial Information Science and Technology program (MCC) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Rwanda Center for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (CGIS). Significant activities include student access to and learning from CGIS on displaced population natural disaster resilience issues unique to Rwanda, East African context student research training activities, and access to disaster management organizations focused on displaced people such as the Rwandan Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR) only available in Rwanda. The project will create unique linkages to East African organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop 17 STEM student research scientists over three years focused on disaster resilience, displacement and GIS. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups as we will fully leverage RIT's existing underrepresented recruitments networks such as RIT's large Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing population, women, and minorities. The MCC student will create a unique opportunity for undergraduate international research experience as well as community college international research capacity development. Displaced people in Rwanda will also benefit through their participation as field research assistants as well as the research providing outreach and advocacy for their situations. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as community-scale resilience maps displacement resilience indexes will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to displacement and disaster resilience research and GIS. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of Rwandan and East African research networks only available by being on-site in Rwanda. CGIS and MIDIMAR for the first time become linked to NSF research. Workshops on disasters and resilience GIS mapping will be conducted by IRES students with Rwandan secondary schools and disaster stakeholder groups for broader project outreach. If successful, findings will be generalizable for additional internationally-focused research beyond displaced population natural disaster resilience in Rwanda (for example, the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises) and particularly US-national interest disaster resilience and displacement issues like seen in hurricanes Harvey and Maria, creating the potential for broader US-national and international research on displaced population natural disaster resilience that can provide future students with the knowledge, motivation and inspiration to pursue internationally-focused science careers to solve US-national and global challenges.<br/><br/>The primary student research project goal is community-level scale field mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of resilience indicators relevant to displaced population natural disaster resilience. Data collected by IRES students will be used as an input for spatially modeling, indexing and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people. The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between displacement and natural disaster resilience. Spatial indexes of displaced population natural disaster resilience currently do not exist at any scale -  let alone at the community-level scale that will only be possible to investigate through the foreign research site. Student research efforts will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) the spatial relationships between displacement and disaster resilience, (b) how developing displacement disaster resilience spatial metrics can inform displacement planning, and (c) how resilience is developed and manifested in displacement and disaster contexts to inform disaster management decision making and risk-reduction. Rwanda is a unique location for research on mapping and quantifying displaced population natural disaster resilience due to both refugee populations and internally displaced Rwandan citizens who face natural disaster risks. Access to these diverse and unique groups is only possible by being in Rwanda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is innovative and potentially transformative displaying considerable possibilities for advancing knowledge and discovery about Sustainable Ecological Aquaculture (SEA) within Maine?s coastal social, economic, and environmental nexus.  Other coastal regions face problems similar to those in Maine and results could inform sustainable solutions to coastal community and aquaculture problems on a global basis.<br/><br/>Maine develops research and education activities to engage a wide number of constituents.  The project will increase public scientific literacy and train a modern STEM workforce.  New STEM programs, mentoring, and research opportunities will specifically recruit females, Native Americans, and other minority students.  Other initiatives include student internships, innovation workshops and the creation of a statewide collaborative network of faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students working together with stakeholders.  Middle and secondary teachers will also be supported to engage in curriculum development.  Economic development activities include the creation of Geographical Information Systems maps that identify the risks and carrying capacity for high valued commercial harvest species.  The activities strengthen areas noted to be important within the State?s Science and Technology Plan such as workforce training and development in the areas of marine ecology and aquaculture.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project seeks develops SEANET to determine the social and environmental carrying capacities of aquaculture systems in Maine?s coastal bioregions.  SEANET is envisioned as a statewide, multi-institutional, academic research network that will advance knowledge and discovery about SEA within coastal Maine?s social, economic, and environmental nexus.  SEANET capitalizes on Maine?s diverse Spcio- ecological systems contexts by comparing and contrasting three coastal bioregions, south, midcoast, and downeast, which comprise important research gradients in amounts of oceanic versus freshwater inputs, physical oceanography, degrees of urbanization and nutrient inputs, social-economic demographics, and intensities of fisheries and aquaculture developments.  A suite of new buoys and sensors, industrial partnerships and models will be used with existing data to assess and monitor the carrying capacity of these areas for aquaculture species over time.  Social research will engage local stakeholders using focus groups, surveys, and interviews and combined with modeling will address perceptions, attitudes and local values related to aquaculture.  The project involves many of the institutes of higher education across the state including community colleges as well as local producer groups and state government agencies."

The researchers will use remote sensing, field work, laboratory experiments, and modeling methods to study boreal forest fires and coastal marine ecosystems. The boreal fire research team will identify drivers of fire weather, map active fire behavior, and evaluate the impacts of wild fire on ecosystem services in affected communities. This project will lead to the development of improved fire spread models and tools for fire risk evaluation, web-based fire forecasts, and will inform fire management. The coastal margins research team will study nearshore coastal ecosystems and evaluate the responses of fish and other marine species to varying glacial environments. The results of both the boreal fire and coastal margins research will benefit natural resource management in Alaska and more generally in regions with wild fires and changing hydrology. The project participants will engage in broadly disseminating the findings of the research to resource managers and Alaskan communities in addition to their efforts to train and mentor students and researchers at all educational levels at K-12 schools and universities. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project focuses on understanding climate-driven changes to 1) fire risk and behavior in Alaska's boreal forest, and 2) glacial and non glacial material flux on the coastal margins of the Gulf of Alaska. This project, will provide comprehensive data streams as well as scenarios, models, tools, and visualizations for use in responding to short-term, climate-driven ecological change. The boreal fires research thrust will identify large-scale climate drivers relevant to fire weather, and use hyperspectral imaging and remote sensing of active wildfires to generate improved maps of fire fuels and active fire behavior. The coastal margins research thrust will determine how glacial melt and increased precipitation are altering material flux across the coastal margin and subsequently influencing nearshore biological communities. Both research thrusts include a human dimensions component that uses social science research to link the project findings to subsistence communities and human populations. The research is combined with the activities of an innovative Diversity, Education, and Workforce Development plan that uses education research to study the effectiveness of diversity recruitment efforts, interventions for helping students overcome stereotype threat, and case studies that explore impact of science identity pathways on student performance within STEM disciplines. The project will advance fundamental knowledge in two vulnerable, understudied and rapidly changing ecosystems and generate findings that will have significant societal and economical relevance to Alaskan communities and natural resource managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flood risk and associated losses can only be understood and eventually reduced through integrated investigation across multiple disciplines, settings, and international<br/>boundaries. There is a critical need for a program-level, trans-disciplinary inquiry in science and engineering that will lay a foundation for decision making aimed at increasing the resiliency of coastal communities. This Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) project takes a comprehensive, multiscale approach to understanding how to reduce risk and vulnerability to damaging coastal floods. By drawing upon knowledge from multiple disciplines and the experience and expertise of partner institutions in Texas and the Netherlands, the PIRE team will pursue six identified case study approaches to cover both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems.  Each case entails integrated assessment, research, and education activities focused on physical flood risk and modeling, as well as understanding socioeconomic characteristics, land use change, the built environment, and mitigation techniques.<br/><br/>Multiple case studies in both countries integrating faculty from engineering, architecture, economics, and planning will address several research questions, including: 1) what are the underlying characteristics of physical flood risks; 2) why are human communities and the built environment so vulnerable to flood impacts, and how will this increase in the future; and 3) which mitigation techniques, both structural and non-structural, are most effective in reducing the adverse impacts of floods? Within each study region in the U.S. and the Netherlands, six sub-case study focal points will be initiated covering both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems. Each case will provide a target area for interdisciplinary assessments of physical flood risk and modeling, socioeconomic characteristics, land use change and built environment, and mitigation techniques. The effectiveness of both structural and non-structural strategies will be investigated, leading to a better understanding of when to pursue avoidance and resistance strategies for mitigating adverse impacts from flood events.  The FRRP will crystalize an existing collaboration consisting of seven participating institutions with 25 faculty supervising dozens of students. Key U.S. partners include Jackson State University, Rice University, TAMU College Station and Galveston, University of Houston, and TX Sea Grant. Dutch partners will include Delft University of Technology and Deltares. U.S. researchers will be able to leverage Dutch data, methods, and facilities associated with flood management."

This project will provide an early-career international research experience for fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme of ""Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)"" as part of a three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) ""Crisis, culture, and heritage"" (2013-2014); 2) ""Sustainable heritage, communities, and economies"" (2014-2015); and 3) ""Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms of value"" (2015-2016).   Students will be trained through a course series in research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing for publication.  International research and training workshops at the two universities will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars, as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers.  <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for interdisciplinary research teambuilding. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Government institutions face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse, multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained in the anthropology of heritage and related fields.  Broader impacts of the project include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international, comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates, 2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally archived by the UMass Amherst library.  Holding an international CHESS workshop at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks, mentoring relationships, and collaborators."

This project will engage several teams of undergraduates from underserved populations - particularly indigenous peoples of the Plains and Southwest states - in scientific research within a culturally sensitive context. A total of 13 students will travel to France over three years to conduct field and lab work on red sediments analogous to the types of sediments and landscapes familiar to them in the U.S. They will work with both U.S. and French scientists in collecting data in both the field and the laboratory, while also learning about the history and culture of a part of France with a geologic history analogous to that of their homeland. This project will further our understanding of how Earth's surface conditions can behave under conditions analogous to the present. <br/><br/>This IRES project will involve three student groups per year undertaking fieldwork in France. Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate. These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis. The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants. Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea. Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea. The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals. In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate interest in science and forge new international collaborations.<br/>"

Increasingly, core applied mathematics topics, ranging from applied probability, to partial differential equation, to optimization, find important applications in areas such as materials science, mathematical biology, operations research, and, more recently, machine learning. Applications of mathematical techniques to real-life problems require both a deep understanding of mathematical theory, as well as acute awareness of both the physical and technical aspects of the problem, as well as implementation details of any numerical algorithms or simulations. For this reason, such successful applications are often a combination of individual and team efforts, with the main problem being divided into more specialized parts, and specific expertise of each team member brought to bear on each such  component.The exact topics of the research projects will change from year to year and will depend on the interest of industry and academic researchers involved.  Generally speaking, the projects will apply mathematical techniques to questions of optimization (such as optimization of rail network throughput), efficient simulation (such as simulation of modern nanophotonic devices) and machine learning (such as analysis of medical mass data sets).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urban decision makers need help to develop ways to meet this challenge that are based in scientific understanding. This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) grant is linked to the Urban Resilience to Extremes (UREx) Sustainability Research Network (SRN). The grant will support three graduate students and one undergraduate student each year for ten weeks work in Valdivia, Chile (2017); Hermosillo, Mexico (2018); and in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (2019). A total of nine UREx IRES graduate students will be trained over three years, broadening their skills in collaboration, transdisciplinary research methods, and in mentoring. They will gain appreciation for the unique challenges of Latin American cities, while benefiting from the opportunity to participate in research that is directly used by decision makers, and receive training and experience in workshop facilitation with local decision-makers and communities. Three UREx IRES undergraduate students will also gain research experience in a foreign country, learn about the process of science through not only conducting their own research project but working closely with graduate students conducting research, and gain skills in research design, data analysis and management, and presentation. This experience will help all of these students learn to work across diverse social and political cultures so that they might be more effective. The students who participate in this program will share their experiences with others in the UREx program through a reading group, blogs, and social media and at a capstone symposium to be organized in 2020 by UREx fellows.<br/><br/><br/>Technical description: Cities are highly vulnerable to extreme, weather-related events, given their location along coastlines and in drylands. As urbanization continues as the main demographic trend worldwide, an ever-greater proportion of the population is exposed to hazard. Little research has been done on Latin American cities, where strategies to enhance their resilience in the face of such events may differ from US cities owing to cultural, political, or biophysical differences. The UREx SRN is a multi-city network of scientists and local practitioners, including Latin American cities, which studies, envisions, and develops innovative solutions to the challenges of these extreme events. Linked to the UREx SRN, the UREx IRES program will train students in working across cultures and disciplines and with local decision-makers. Mentors at the host institutions are collaborators in the UREx SRN and are conducting urban resilience research in these cities. The UREx IRES will afford opportunities for nine UREx fellows to expand their dissertation research into these Latin American cities, enabling projects that can be used to compare resilient solutions between US and Latin American cities. Three UREx IRES undergraduates will be selected to work on research projects in close collaboration with the graduate students, supervised by host mentors. The students' creativity is emphasized: as part of the UREx SRN they will have had experience with interdisciplinary research, training on Latin American cities, and will write a short research proposal that explains how their IRES project will integrate with their dissertation research and contribute to the overall knowledge-to-action efforts in the host city. UREx IRES fellows will be conducting transdisciplinary research with practitioners and host mentors that will advance basic scientific understanding of the characteristics of urban areas in general and infrastructure in particular that will lead to more resilient, and ultimately sustainable, cities in the future."

The goal of this project is to create a new interdisciplinary research center leading to a Sustainable, Modular, Adaptive, Resilient, and Transactive (SMART) next-generation electric grid. NM EPSCoR will establish a SMART Grid Center to address the power, communication, and control needs of the electrical distribution network. The goal is to provide consumers the ability to decide how to generate, store, and manage energy on the existing electricity distribution infrastructure. The Center will align with the New Mexico State Science & Technology Plan?s focus on technology development to ensure energy stability, security, resilience, and sustainability for the State. It will also support the development of a well-trained STEM workforce for New Mexico, the hiring and retention of new faculty, and an increase in diversity at all levels.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The New Mexico SMART Grid Center will transform the existing electricity distribution infrastructure by holistically incorporating microgrid optimization, operations optimization, microgrid controls, and tariff and customer behavior in the design and demonstration of interconnected Distribution Feeder Microgrids (DFMs). With simulation studies and field validations, the research team aims to demonstrate that the DFM-based architecture: 1) is optimally suited to sustainably accommodate the emerging trends in electricity generation, storage, and utilization; 2) is flexible and can be adapted to various geographic and socioeconomic conditions; 3) can be interwoven with a secure and robust communications and controls infrastructure; 4) is more resilient than alternative options; and 5) enables new business models and continued innovation in the delivery of energy services. Building on existing expertise and infrastructures, the SMART Grid Center will develop new technologies, protocols, models, and algorithms for the future electric grid that can be broadly applied to future socio-cyber-physical systems, the Internet-of-Things, smart cities research and deployments, big data applications, and coordination in multi-agent systems.

This project aims to design, synthesize, and characterize molecule-based inorganic 4d/5d transition metals halides with the goal of understanding how magnetic properties are related to their chemical composition and atomic structure, and of facilitating technological applications over time. Currently, major experimental and theoretical efforts have been solely undertaken to search for novel spin-orbit coupling systems in various d5 systems where S=1/2.  We will investigate structure-magnetism interactions and understand the intrinsic interplay of electronic, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom arising from a complex balance of electron-electron correlations (U), spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and crystal-field theory (CFT).

However, understanding the exact link between soil microbial communities and these processes is not always clear. Gaining this understanding is of particular importance in a changing world. One change likely to influence soil microbial communities, and the processes they regulate, are inputs of agricultural antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics has been a topic of recent public and scientific concern because of its potential to increase antibiotic resistance in environmental microbial communities and transfer resistance genes to pathogenic organisms. While this emphasis is important to public health it overlooks the impact, antibiotics may have on soil microbial communities. Through this fellowship the PI will examine the effect of antibiotics on soil microbial communities and the processes that they regulate. This understanding will improve understanding of the response of soil microbial communities to perturbations and may ultimately enable us to better understand the critical role played by these communities in the environment. Furthermore, this fellowship will build research capacity at the University of Idaho and improve the training of faculty, research personnel, and graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The overuse of antibiotics has been a topic of recent public and scientific concern because of its potential to increase antibiotic resistance in environmental microbial communities and transfer resistance genes to pathogenic organisms. While this emphasis is important for public health, it overlooks the broader impacts of antibiotic overuse on soil microbial communities. Given the potential that as much as 14 million kilograms of antibiotics could be entering soils annually through livestock manure, there could be widespread implications for soil microbial communities. This is especially concerning because soil microbial communities are central to the critical functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Research is beginning to indicate that antibiotic inputs can alter microbial-mediated biogeochemical cycles, but the specific changes in the microbial community that lead to these alterations are unclear. The research will clarify the specific changes in microbial community structure via a multi-omic approach. This approach includes the integration of multiple forms of -omic data (e.g., metagenomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes) to give a clearer picture of the response of microbial community structure to antibiotics and the ensuing impact on ecosystem function. Training in multi-omic techniques will occur in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). Through this fellowship, collaborations between PNNL and the University of Idaho will be strengthened allowing for the application of multi-omic techniques across multiple disciplines, from infectious disease to veterinary science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fellowship enables an early career researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a graduate student trainee to collaborate with researchers at the Oregon State University.  While there they will use state-of-the art equipment to determine the age of young volcanic rocks from Alaska's Aleutian and Wrangell arcs.  Precise geological dating of young volcanic rocks is important in understanding the eruptive history of volcanoes in Alaska, volcanic and seismic hazards assessment, and tectonic reconstructions.  The project will investigate how the chemistry and environments of the samples and the sensitivity and precision of available measurement instrumentation contribute to the uncertainties in determining the age of young volcanic rocks.

The amount and composition of DOM affects a range of critical ecosystem functions, and plays important roles in regulating the chemistry of environments as diverse as soils, surface waters, and marine systems. DOM can selectively combine with salts and attach to natural particles, which would change their chemical properties in complex ways. This project aims to determine the molecular-level composition and properties of DOM compounds using advanced analytical techniques available at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Obtaining molecular-level properties for individual molecules will enable more specific identification of the DOM molecules and improve our understanding of their behaviors, fate, and transport in the environment. The outcome of the proposed research has direct implications for environmental and human health as it may be used by water and wastewater treatment facilities to develop novel approaches to achieve more effective approaches for DOM removal.

Such understanding is currently hampered by the high diversity and complexity of DOM and the limited resolution of available mass spectrometers. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the application of ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy techniques to identify DOM molecules that selectively aggregate or selectively sorb to natural particles and the characterization of their structural properties at the individual molecular level. The overall aim of this proposed research is to characterize the molecular composition and properties of DOM compounds susceptible to aggregation or sorption to natural particles as a function of DOM composition, salt type and natural particle properties. This aim will be achieved by characterizing the molecular composition and properties of DOM molecules in solution (that is <10 kDa) before and after mixing with salts of Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Fe3+, and natural clay and metal (Fe, Mn, Al, and Si) oxide  particles using 21 T Electrospray ionization ultrahigh resolution-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Molecular-level characterization of DOM will be performed at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL).

The University of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.  <br/>Our research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people who might spy on them through their data.

The fellowship enables the PI, a social scientist from the University of Montana, to partner with ecologists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to develop a statistical method for identifying evidence of discrete social and ecological transitions that have occurred in the Middle Platte River watershed of central Nebraska since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. This analysis will be applied to distinguish specific policy mechanisms that could be employed to improve degraded agricultural systems through landscape-scale improvements in ecosystem health. This research and the associated partnerships will directly support interdisciplinary graduate education as well as provide a statistical analysis tool designed to overcome persistent disciplinary barriers to data integration between ecological and social scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The goal of this research is to better understand the potential for human-led transformations of degraded agricultural systems across the U.S. Researchers will develop quantitative methods for more robust identification of coupled social and ecological processes that have led to systemic regime shifts. This will be achieved by analyzing time-series datasets for a variety of both social and biophysical processes in the Middle Platte River watershed of central Nebraska. The Middle Platte River agricultural system is a data-rich test case where multiple social-ecological regime shifts have occurred since the Dust Bowl. Research objectives and methods include: (1) gathering available datasets representing key environmental processes (e.g. water use, water quality, agricultural production data) and social shifts (e.g. demographics, public attitudes toward agriculture) since the 1930s agricultural transition in the Great Plains; (2) performing discontinuity analysis using Fisher information to detect and statistically explain evidence of regime shifts in the multivariate data; and (3) characterizing shifts in governance affecting agricultural landscapes before, after, and during identified regime shifts using statistical analysis (QCA) of qualitative, archival data such as local agricultural laws, policies, and industry or community periodicals. Characterizing the governance surrounding past regime shifts in the Middle Platte River watershed will help researchers further explain the potential of governance to either stifle or support social-ecological system transformation from degraded to more sustainable regimes. This research contributes to a growing body of knowledge suggesting adaptive and transformative governance processes as means to mitigate, adapt to, and potentially transform social-ecological systems in response to the impacts global environmental change. Specifically, this research addresses the need for productivity, sustainability, and resilience in the face of natural and human-caused changes."

Future preparation may be guided by a better understanding of how climate varied naturally over the past millennium - preceding the start of the industrial revolution and significant human impact on the environment. Our PIRE brings together a team of international experts from five research institutions in the United States, Brazil and Argentina. By improving our understanding of past climate variations over North and South America, we will place future climate projections within a longer-term framework to better inform international policymakers and stakeholders. PIRE researchers will investigate the nature of extreme events over the two continents during the last one thousand years by merging data from the two largest tree-ring and cave sediment (stalagmite) archives in South America with new, unpublished records. Our research will enlarge our understanding of the underlying causes of past climate perturbations, many of which were associated with large societal impacts (famine, disease and warfare). We will prepare a new generation of students and postdoctoral scholars through the interdisciplinary research training. Results will be translated into visualization models and toolkits of policy-relevant climate information for the scientific community, government and civil society. The international partners are from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. This award is co-funded by the Paleoclimate program. <br/><br/><br/>Technical:<br/>Narrowing the range of possible future outcomes from climate change projections over North and South America demands enhanced scientific understanding of the natural continuum of climate variability. The goal of the PIRE-CREATE is to advance our knowledge of paleoclimate over the Americas to identify drivers of climate change from a paleo-perspective. By combining new tree-ring chronologies and speleothem records, the PIRE's research team will investigate the characteristics and causes of climate extremes spanning North and South America during the last millennium. Specifically, the PIRE will advance the following scientific objectives: 1) document the sensitivity of the South American monsoon to external forcing; 2) create a new reconstruction of the El Nio - Southern Oscillation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation; 3) identify past extreme events and analyze their causes and societal response; 4) merge tree-ring and speleothem records over tropical South America into a new blended product that serves as the basis for a spatiotemporal climate reconstruction over tropical South America; and 5) reduce the uncertainty of future projections by constraining past model performance with observed variability from proxies. This PIRE will produce new climate reconstructions, detect and analyze past climate extremes (droughts, wildfires, floods) and their societal response, create a new paleo-product by synergistically blending different proxies, and better constrain regional-scale future projections based on past model-data comparisons, which will serve as an ideal testbed for model assessment. In addition, this PIRE will prepare a globally competent, interdisciplinary trained, scientific workforce by a) immersing graduate and undergraduate students in research activities involving data collection in the field, analysis of lab observations and models, and dissemination of data and findings; b) strengthening cultural literacy and the enrichment of students, postdocs and faculty through scholarly collaboration with PIRE colleagues, visiting early-career fellowships, and international online courses; c) enhancing the global competence of undergraduate and graduate students with a semester abroad at partner institutions facilitated through PIRE Offices of International Education, mentorship through an international committee, and graduate research activities; d) providing experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students through international summer schools and hands-on training; and e) broadening participation in STEM by hosting six PIRE Academies aimed at undergraduate students across SUNY - particularly, SUNY's 125,000 minority and 225,000 female students. Further, the PIRE will serve to enhance awareness and knowledge of the future risks associated with climate change across the Americas by translating its research findings into novel, easy-to-use visualization tools to increase comprehension of complex paleoclimate data, model projections, and impacts of climate change over the two continents. The PIRE's partners will also co-host two International Forums bringing together scientists, government officials, legislators, ministry staff and other key stakeholders from the Americas to learn about the PIRE's research findings, to disseminate visualization models and toolkits, and to transform the scientific results into actionable planning options and policy considerations for North and South America, as well as the wider global community."

This project will determine: (1) how city habitats, infrastructure and socioeconomic factors, shape the movement of urban rats; and (2) which specific factors consistently influence rat movement across different cities. The PI will use genetic data on rats from four cities to understand the specific effects of urban habitat in four cities: Salvador, Brazil; New York City; New Orleans; and Vancouver, British Columbia. This study will enable more effective rat population control efforts and public health campaigns. The fellowship will promote collaboration between the PI (at Providence College) and scientists at Fordham University, who contribute expertise in DNA sequence analysis and specialized statistics required for this project.

Lakes dominated by large aquatic plants are able to maintain a relatively stable, clear water state, while lakes dominated by algae are more likely to suffer from a decline in both water quality and ecosystem health. The most important factor controlling whether a lake is plant- versus algae-dominated is the input of nutrients such as phosphorous, which has increased in many lakes as a result of human activity. Annual and seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation can amplify nutrient-driven changes in aquatic plant growth.  These short-term climatic impacts have increased concern over the long-term water quality of lakes in the face of predictions of climate change. Lake sediment, which accumulates in layers at the bottom of lakes through time, provides an opportunity to investigate the dynamics between past climate change and aquatic plant growth over longer time-scales and to gain insights into how aquatic ecosystems will be impacted in the future by climate change.  Lake sediment samples from central Vermont contain data on the chemical composition of the sediment and fossils of plants and animals, which will be used to reconstruct changes in both climate and aquatic plant growth during the last 10,000 years.  A network of existing climate reconstructions from the northeast documents several past regional climatic changes, which will provide a context for evaluating how lakes respond to changes in temperature and/or precipitation.  Collaboration with the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming will enable access to critical analyses, as well as training in innovative statistical approaches to data analysis. The results of this project will build a strong collaboration between researchers at Norwich University and the University of Wyoming while establishing new methods for investigating past aquatic ecosystems and contributing to a greater understanding of the long-term connections between aquatic plant growth, water quality, and climate change. This work will inform future management decisions concerning the conservation of Vermont's lakes and will provide additional evidence on the impact that projected climate change will have on valuable freshwater resources.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The fates of lakes and other freshwater resources in Vermont have become of central environmental concern due to increased nutrient loading.  In small lakes, nutrient loading controls the dominance of phytoplankton versus macrophytes, and is a determinant of water quality and ecosystem health. Macrophytes promote a clear-water state while excessive phytoplankton leads to turbid-water and eutrophic conditions. In addition to changes in nutrient loads, fish population size and composition, lake size and depth, and climate, have the potential to induce a shift between macrophyte- and phytoplankton-states.  Climate is the least well-understood of these factors and poses an important set of research questions in Vermont, where during the last 50 years, winter and summer mean annual temperatures and total precipitation have increased. This study will provide long-term insight into these issues by using lake sediment cores from central Vermont to reconstruct past changes in lake primary productivity and climate during the Holocene Epoch (10,000-0 years before present).  Temperature and precipitation changes during the Holocene in the northeastern United States are well-documented by a network of paleoecological sites, and provide an opportunity to examine the role of climate as a driver of aquatic ecosystem change. Carbonate-rich lakes in central Vermont contain multiple depositional environments that preserve unique sets of proxy data that will enable the reconstruction of independent records of climate and paleoproductivity. This work will be done in collaboration with the University of Wyoming and will use a suite of sediment and geochemical analyses that are available within the Departments of Geology and Geophysics' laboratories.  In addition, the collaborator at the University of Wyoming has developed quantitative approaches to analysis of multivariate paleoecological data that will be used to identify statistically significant patterns of variability. The work completed during this fellowship will employ novel approaches to reconstructing past changes in lake productivity that may be adopted more widely by other researchers and will expand the application of paleoecology to understanding modern limnological processes."

Algorithms for shading prediction and fault optimization will advance the state of the art in remote solar array management.  Training students in machine learning, vision and data processing for energy systems is unique and requires an integrative approach.  IRES participants will be immersed in producing and understanding solar analytics and creating algorithms and software to control solar arrays. The IRES program will engage faculty researchers from the Arizona State University SenSIP center and from the University of Cyprus KIOS Center in solar energy research. Programs and workshops will be established so that IRES participants are trained in machine learning for energy systems and present their research results in international settings. Weekly presentations at the international site and guidance by international mentors will enrich the cohort research experience. Embedding students in the KIOS center research labs funded by large European Union (EU) grants will provide knowledge on EU and international research practices, energy standards and policies. Students will spend six summer weeks at the University of Cyprus KIOS center to improve their research skills and elevate their cultural competencies.  This international research endeavor will energize students to innovate and disseminate results globally. <br/><br/> Solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) arrays encounter loss of efficiency under conditions of shading, panel faults and temperature variations.  In fact, shading, weather patterns, soiling, and temperature reduce power output considerably. For example, a malfunction of one panel will cause an entire PV string to fail.  To minimize inefficiencies, individual panel current-voltage (I-V) measurements, weather information, and imaging data are essential. Controlling the power output is possible through solar panel matrix switching and optimization (i.e., changing certain array connections from series to parallel using actuators). Matrix switching using programmable relays allows for different interconnection options. The research goal is to optimize PV array systems by: a) exploiting the measured I-V patterns to detect faults using machine learning, b) employing advanced imaging and vision techniques to predict shading, c)  using temperature, irradiance  and weather data to elevate PV efficiency, and d) include smart grid interfaces.  This collaborative IRES project between Arizona State University and University of Cyprus will engage students in the following research problems: a) How do we use imaging to detect cloud movement, predict shading and elevate efficiency? b) How can the array connections be reconfigured based on imaging, weather, and I-V data to elevate efficiency? c) How can we detect and classify panel faults in real time using machine learning and other algorithms? d) How do we extend these solar monitoring and control concepts from utility-scale solar farms to house rooftop systems?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many large cities of U.S., there are environmental problems similar to Beijing, so the monitoring technology learned by participating students will provide valuable reference and an essential technology reserve. The participating students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of China from Beijing, the culture center of China.<br/><br/>Student participants will learn to design advanced environmental monitoring systems that integrate energy harvest and remote control, which can track all four categories of environmental contaminants including metals, radioisotopes, volatile organic contaminants, and biological contaminants. In this project, tasks for student participants include sensor developments, interface circuits designs, wireless sensor network designs for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems to realize environmental monitoring, testing the proposed monitoring system on laboratory and field sites, and making reliability-based lifetime analyses. The proposed system is a much-needed technology for environmental decision-making that will help substantially reduce ecological and human-health threats from environmental problems, and the implemented prototype and test data will be a significant reference for the other academic researchers and industrial developers. Evaluation data collection will occur sequentially using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The primary goals of this program are to: 1) provide students with training and mentoring in international-based engineering applications that will create a positive effect in their professional and personal lives, 2) create Native American experts in environmental monitoring and protection, and 3) improve specialized environmental management in the remote areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instruments capable of visualization of molecular structures are developing, such that newly developed instruments may be only available at a few locations. This fellowship will enable comprehensive training in an advanced form of microscopy called single-particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy(Cryo-EM). Once trained at the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI), the PI will use this equipment to visualize biomolecular structures at the atomic level. This will strengthen the development of comprehensive structural biological tools at the University of Montana. Knowledge of the three-dimensional arrangement of macromolecular atoms makes it possible to understand fundamental mechanistic details of critical biological processes and the interactions between biomolecules. For many years, X-ray crystallography was the most common method for determining macromolecular structure; however, many important molecules, including membrane proteins, do not readily crystallize. Thanks to the recent development of cryo-EM as a next-generation technology for structural biology, analysis of large and dynamic complex assembles is now possible. The NCMI is one of a few national cryo-EM core facilities staffed with experts to provide training and automated single-particle data acquisition. Through collaborative visits with NCMI at  Baylor University in Houston, TX, the PI and a student trainee will receive in-depth knowledge of cryo-EM and hands-on experience to operate cryo-EM instrumentation. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The fellowship will provide the PI with training on Cryo-EM and associated techniques, which will be used in his work on the analysis of the structure and function of specific proteins. In particular, the project will involve characterization of mammalian Ric-8A and its associated binding compounds, and the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein. The overall cryo-EM training at NCMI includes sample preparation, 2-dimensional (2-D) data imaging, single-particle alignment and averaging, 3-D map construction, and model development. A significant portion of the training will also focus on practicing with the latest software packages developed for data acquisition, 3-D reconstructions, structural analysis and visualization of the cryo-EM results. This cryo-EM training will strengthen collaborations between the NCMI and researchers from the University of Montana who wish to extend their research on structural biology to include cryo-EM technology, especially for samples that exhibit conformational heterogeneity, making them unsuitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis."

While vertical erosion into bedrock landscapes has been extensively studied, there is little consensus on how rivers erode laterally in bedrock landscapes. It is crucial to establish the duration of lateral widening intervals that create bedrock valleys in order to understand how changes in river dynamics shape the Earth's surface. Through a collaboration with the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the PI will learn luminescence dating techniques that will allow her to establish the timing of lateral erosion intervals and apply these techniques to infer transport history of sediments. Determining the timing of past and current river incision is important for predicting the effect of ongoing landscape change on humans who live and work near rivers in Kansas, the PI's home state. The PI's home institution, Kansas State University, will benefit from the professional development of the PI, her extended collaborative network with DRI, and the incorporation of dating techniques in research and teaching to demonstrate how local rivers change on decadal and centennial time scales that humans must be prepared to adapt to.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The processes that control vertical incision in bedrock rivers are widely studied and well characterized; however, the fundamental processes that control lateral erosion have not been quantified in the laboratory or in the field. Field data that describes past channel mobility and defines absolute time constraints on the length of lateral erosion intervals are vital for better understanding the conditions that result in wide bedrock valleys. Analysis of luminescence properties is a key tool for dating fluvial deposits to determine periods of lateral erosion and vertical incision. It also has the potential to illuminate transport processes, such as channel mobility, during periods of sediment deposition. Research conducted during this project has the potential to transform our understanding about the processes and timing of the evolution of bedrock valley systems. Two main project objectives support the overarching goals: (1) learning single-grain luminescence techniques to date the depositional age of sediments with complex transport histories; (2) interpreting luminescence properties as a proxy for fluvial processes, such as channel mobility. Using luminescence techniques to interpret geomorphic processes is an emerging application that has the potential to give insight beyond dating. When this project is complete, the geomorphology community will be closer to interpreting luminescence properties as proxies of transport processes to assess past channel mobility from sediment deposited in association with periods of bedrock valley formation and ultimately a new way of interpreting a wealth of measured, but previously unexamined data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this study, faculty and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound? 1in Cameroon. Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments. Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.<br/><br/>This IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model. Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research topics and graduate student theses. A goal of our IRES program is to attract underrepresented minority students and mentor them to develop self-confidence, independent and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in a research and in careers in the geosciences. By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.<br/><br/>Carbon in estuaries are an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date, there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period, US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping) that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium) affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subduction produces most of Earth's deadliest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, for example around the Pacific Ocean rim's ""Ring of Fire"". ExTerra (Exhumed Terranes) is a broad US geosciences consortium that investigates rocks exhumed from fossil subduction zones - rocks whose evolution uniquely illuminates processes otherwise obscured beneath the surface of active subduction zones. ExTerra will partner with our sister European organization ZIP (Zooming In between Plates) using novel field institutes to promote collaborative research among US and European researchers focused on subduction zone processes. The E-FIRE project develops a new paradigm for collaborative geological research that focuses on collaborative field work to collect materials held communally, augmented by broad interactions through workshops and student exchanges. Each researcher contributes a different analytical expertise to a combined effort aimed at transforming our understanding of active subduction zone processes. International partnership is critical because European researchers actively investigating the geology of each field area will provide foundational field knowledge of the region and actively participate in analysis and interpretation with US researchers. The project will integrate students and post-doctoral scholars (Early-Stage Researchers, ESRs) into a developing international network of scientists, help train ESRs in research and education, and provide a model for future geoscience collaborations across disciplines.

The processes by which rocks, melts, and aqueous fluids exchange and interact among different physical components of the subduction system control all aspects of subduction. These processes occur deep within subduction zones, and a full understanding of these deep processes is a challenge both for investigations using remote geophysical methods and for scientists investigating active volcanoes above subduction zones. Investigations of exhumed rocks from within the subduction zone provide a unique, direct source of information regarding these processes. Specific research questions that we will explore include: 1) How do elements cycle among crust, mantle and Earth's surface?  2) What are the depths, temperatures, and timescales of rock transformation and fluid release within subduction zones? and 3) What is the mechanical behavior of materials within subduction zones? The proposed projects will adopt a variety of approaches to address these questions, including mineralogical and petrological analysis; textural characterization; geochemical analysis of major elements, trace-elements (e.g. HFSE, REE, etc.), stable isotopes (e.g. &#948;37Cl, &#948;13C), and radiogenic isotopes (U-Pb and Sm-Nd); and thermodynamic modeling. E-FIRE will implement a series of Field Institutes and Workshops aimed at developing an international, interdisciplinary network of scientists focused on subduction zone processes. These activities, along with student exchanges among participating institutions, will train early stage researchers (ESRs: students and post-doctoral scholars) in research, communication, and collaborative practice, ultimately developing a career-long collaborative network. Samples and data collected during E-FIRE will be archived and made available to the greater research community."

In cities and towns in low- and middle-income countries, water, sanitation, and electricity services are provided through a patchwork of options: water may be provided only a few times a week through pipes, while houses use groundwater in the interim; electricity may be delivered through unreliable grids combined with decentralized solar home systems. At the same time, utilities in high-income countries are confronting changes in their industries: water and electricity utilities need to generate revenue while also encouraging conservation; wastewater facilities are transitioning from treatment and disposal to recovery of energy and nutrients. This presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine the future of these utilities. The forefront of innovation is occurring in low-income but rapidly developing cities like Nairobi, Kenya, which are open to new ideas given their more limited previous investments in centralized infrastructure. <br/><br/>The IRES project will engage seventeen students over the course of three years to spend 10-12 weeks working alongside collaborators in Nairobi, Kenya, including researchers from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore University. The research focuses on addressing the common challenges faced by water, electricity, and sanitation utilities in rapidly changing cities. Example projects include: designing a sensing system for electric vehicles to provide grid balancing in Kenya; comparing the environmental and human health impacts of neighborhood- and city-wide human waste management options; improving water supply operations and planning; and quantifying the flexibility of industrial electricity consumption in Kenya. Students will be recruited from multiple disciplines, with a focus on ensuring participation by students traditionally underrepresented in STEM. To prepare for the summer spent in Kenya, students will enroll in a one-credit course. Projects will be designed such that students have clear objectives and can accomplish data collection and analysis within the given timespan, and integrate their project into their overall student experience. Students will also have the opportunity for professional development, including engaging with industries and government in Kenya and participating in a one-week workshop on writing and data presentation. The result will be a cohort of US students equipped with the ideas, skills, and motivation to improve the service delivery of the water, sanitation, and electricity utilities of the future and function as members of global workforces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's goal is to address these fundamental challenges by introducing a new adaptive dynamic programming-based learning control framework and integrate it into space robot navigation and scouting applications such as the Mars Rover. The scientific contribution of this project will promote interdisciplinary research in computational intelligence, machine learning, control and robotics. In addition to space applications, the proposed structure can also be applied to robot-assisted pedestrian evacuation application and cyber-physical power systems and is expected to impact general systems beyond this project period. Due to geographic isolation, South Dakota doesn't have a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) research center, and research collaboration opportunities on space technology is very limited. This project will expand the principle investigator (PI)'s research capacity through an extended visit and collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center located in San Jose, CA, and transform the PI's career path from theoretical algorithm/architecture development towards a new direction in complex space applications. Meanwhile, the outcomes of this project align well with the South Dakota's and South Dakota State University's strategic plans. The collaboration fits well with NASA's mission to Mars and technology roadmaps.<br/><br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The proposed project will fundamentally advance the learning and association of biologically-inspired control methods. Three major contributions to the scientific field are expected. First, a new experience network is proposed and systematically integrated into a model-free adaptive dynamic programming-based learning control framework. The PI will design an experience replay tuple (i.e., state-action-reward pair) based on backward temporal difference information from historical data. This design can avoid the model network/prediction noted in existing literature and significantly save computation resources. Second, instead of a uniform sampling method, the PI proposes a prioritized sampling method based on the Bellman's estimation error. This new method is expected to enhance the controller's reflective learning performance with useful long-short term memory. The stability and convergence properties will also be analyzed. Third, this project is closely tied with NASA on robot and optimal control for space program. This new learning control structure will be integrated for robot navigation, exploration and scouting in unknown spaces. The PI and the collaborator will use both a virtual reality platform and a real Rover facility to analyze the control performance of the proposed algorithm at NASA Ames. The PI's outreach and dissemination plans will cultivate the scientific curiosity of K-12 students and motivate their interest in STEM programs. Moreover, the integration of the project's cutting-edge research results into the PI's new courses will aid retention of current STEM students.

The project team will develop a research and training program in the Genomic Ecology of Coastal Organisms (GECO) to advance understanding of the genetic bases of organismal responses to natural environments. The program integrates genomic technologies with field-based ecological and observational data of six species of tidal marsh birds inhabiting a harsh environmental gradient in a coastal ecosystem. The research will reveal insights into the genetic basis of adaptation at a genome-wide level and the links between genotype, phenotype and environment in the context of resulting organismal performance and fitness. These are key questions in evolutionary biology today, which can only be pursued through studies like this one of wild populations in dynamic, natural environments. The project will thereby advance understanding of long-standing questions in evolutionary biology as well as provide novel insight into genetic elements and mechanisms that underlie organismal resilience and adaptive capacity. The latter are important for predicting organismal responses to rapidly changing environments. To facilitate societal benefit, conservation implications of this project will be transferred directly to resource managers and other stakeholders. The project provides extensive training and mentoring opportunities for the team aimed at producing professionals adept at systems-level thinking at all biological scales. Educational activities include the development of a new graduate training certificate in ecological genomics and at the undergraduate-level, the development of active-learning modules aimed at addressing known conceptual difficulties in genetics, ecology, and evolution.

This collaborative project between the Universities of New Hampshire and Maine addresses this knowledge gap through a research and training program in the Genomic Ecology of Coastal Organisms (GECO), focused on advancing understanding of the genetic bases of organismal responses to natural environments. The systems-level approach of this program links genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic data to organismal performance and fitness, using six tidal marsh bird species undergoing parallel evolutionary processes in a dynamic coastal ecosystem. The research will advance understanding of long-standing questions in evolutionary biology about the genetic bases and genomic architecture of adaptation, the influence of phylogeny on parallel evolution, and the relative roles of phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. It will also provide novel insight into genetic elements and mechanisms that underlie organismal resilience and adaptive capacity, as well as the extended effects of genome and phenome variation for ecological communities and ecosystems. The resulting insights are needed for predicting organismal responses to rapidly changing future environments, a critical and timely scientific goal with important societal benefits. Conservation implications of this research will be rapidly transferred to stakeholders from state, federal, and non-governmental organization with a focus on translating research into on-the-ground actions. The program provides training and mentoring for early career faculty, postdoctoral associates and numerous graduate and undergraduate students in ecological genomics. It creates a graduate certificate in Genome to Phenome Adaptation; active-learning, systems-level teaching modules for undergraduate genetics, ecology, and evolution courses; and STEM pedagogical training for post-docs and early career faculty. A Diversity Action Plan guides recruitment and retention of program members and STEM-based outreach programs will expose high school students from underrepresented low-income groups and rural areas to scientific tools and research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit Tsinghua University (THU) over a period of eight (8) weeks. <br/><br/>The vision of IoT is to embed small computers into objects around our daily life to improve our economy and societal well-being. It is estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020. However, one of the biggest challenges is how to power these billions of embedded devices since batteries need frequent recharging and impose health and environmental concerns. In this project, the students will work with renowned research groups at THU to develop future IoT sensors that can reply on energy harvested from ambient environment sources, such as solar energy, radio frequency energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Since ambient energy is intrinsically intermittent, the students will conduct research on nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software to realize computer systems that can work with intermittent energy supply. Such systems will dramatically improve our capability of collecting data while reducing the maintenance costs. Potential applications include smart healthcare, smart building and infrastructure monitoring, smart environmental monitoring, etc. This IRES project will not only offer U.S. students an opportunity to work in one of the best engineering research universities in China, but also fully immerse them in a foreign environment and improve their talents in working with a global team. <br/><br/>The project contains well-planned recruitment, preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research targets at nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software issues in battery-less embedded systems that need to be addressed urgently. The first project aims to develop fast, energy efficient, and uniform write operations for nano-scale memory device, which is critical to tolerate intermittency of harvested energy. The project addresses a fundamental inconsistency issue when the NVP is interacting with external volatile peripheral devices, which is one of the most imminent roadblocks towards wide application of NVPs. <br/>The second project addresses a fundamental inconsistency issue when the battery-less device is collecting data and communicating with external devices. The project aims to develop efficient and accurate binarized neural network for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on nonvolatile IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications. <br/> The third project aims to develop efficient and accurate artificial intelligence for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on battery-less IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications. It can be anticipated that with the close interaction with THU and the Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chips, the breakthroughs made from these projects can have a direct impact on future IoT market.<br/><br/>The project will enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on realizing battery-less embedded systems, in collaboration with their faculty mentors in THU. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the<br/>research of embedded computer systems, on the culture of China, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through the personal social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, Web2.0 based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for local K-12 schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, fertilizer runoff produces many secondary problems such as aquatic dead zones with low oxygen contents, and reduced water quality, increasing the costs of providing safe drinking water in agricultural regions of the country. Genetic gains in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by plants will aid in protecting yield while mitigating both costs and negative environmental impacts associated with high rates of fertilizer application in agriculture. Through this Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) project, researchers at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Alabama and the University of Nebraska will partner to conduct cutting-edge plant genomics research to better understand how nitrogen affects plant growth and development. HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology will bring its biotechnology education and agricultural genomics research expertise to the collaborative project while the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will contribute its expertise in plant transformation and automated phenotyping with their state-of-the-art automated greenhouse system for imaging large plants. Researchers will collect information of how plants respond to nitrogen levels through a variety of genetic, biotechnological, and observational methods in the widely-used grain crop sorghum. Sorghum thrives in climates where many food crops struggle and is more efficient at utilizing resources such as water and nitrogen. It is an ideal crop to target for improvement to meet the predicted doubling of global food demand by 2050. In addition, the project will include an educational component, which will train and inspire students to pursue genetic and biotechnology-based research for agriculture. To accomplish this, HudsonAlpha will develop a three-week summer course for advanced high school students called the ""AgriGenomics Academy."" Additional activities include the recruitment of three undergraduate students who will complete summer internships at both HudsonAlpha and University of Nebraska-Lincoln to learn advanced techniques, and support for the Launching Aspiring Biotechnology Students (LABS) program, which introduces low and moderate-income students to biotechnology. The project will also mentor four early career faculty. In addition to nitrogen use efficacy, the combined efforts of these two institutions will make significant progress toward understanding the biology of other complex agronomic crop traits.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the role of genes in nitrogen (N) responsive co-expression networks in sorghum using a combination of genomics, biotechnology and automated phenotyping by combining the expertise at the Hudson Alpha Institute of Biotechnology and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. We will achieve this goal through three main objectives: (i) Generate transcriptomic and phenotypic data to characterize the molecular responses of sorghum to N availability; (ii) perturb the N response by combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and overexpression of key genes in N network modules; and (iii) characterize plants with targeted changes in components of the N network. Genomic and transcriptomic data will be used to identify key regulatory sequences controlling genes predicted to affect nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), through effects on component traits of NUE from nitrogen assimilation through in planta metabolism. These predicted target regulatory sequences and genes will be validated in sorghum using innovative protocols for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to manipulate the promoters of high-priority gene targets, resulting in expression changes of these genes. Lines confirmed to carry misexpressing alleles will be characterized across development under different levels of nitrogen deficit stress using nondestructive, high throughput phenotyping techniques. Plants exhibiting phenomic changes under N deficit stress will be analyzed for variation in their gene expression networks to understand their roles in regulating sorghum's responses to N deficit stress. The outcome of this program holds great potential to expand our knowledge on N responsive gene regulatory networks and associated gene function in sorghum and closely related C4 grasses. It can also serve as a model for understanding other complex agronomic traits through gene network manipulation. This project will contribute to research infrastructure capacity building by cross-training and motivating students and post-docs to explore strategies to improve the rate of genetic gains in crops by understanding how genomic and phenomic approaches can be integrated using cutting edge genomic, molecular, and whole-plant tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The extraction of geothermal energy from the deep rock requires a man-made geothermal reservoir created by injecting liquid into the rock at high pressure to cause fractures, a process known as hydraulic fracturing. However, our knowledge of fracture development is limited by internal processes within the rocks that have proven challenging to characterize. This fellowship will establish a long-term collaboration between the PI and researchers at Idaho National Laboratory to develop tools that will more effectively estimate the rock properties.  This will be done by incorporating data collected from hydraulic fracturing experiments conducted in a deep mine into a state-of-the-art numerical model for fracture propagation. The proposed research will provide comprehensive training for the PI and a graduate student on hydraulic fracture modeling. The proposed project also has the potential to build a partnership between the PI's home institution and commercial entities that are interested in developing hydraulic fracturing techniques for enhanced oil recovery.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand and quantify fracture growth and the exchange of the heat between rock and fluid in a geothermal reservoir. This will be achieved by leveraging the newly developed network flow-Discrete Element Model (DEM) by Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to model fracture propagation and building on hydraulic fracturing experiments conducted at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, a mined underground research laboratory. Research objectives and methods include: (1) modeling hydraulic fracture propagation under stimulation using network flow-DEM method; and (2) estimating geomechanical properties using monitoring data (e.g., pressure and temperature) via iterative normal-score ensemble smoothing, a novel inverse method developed by the PI for dealing with non-Gaussianity (i.e., connectivity). The proposed coupling of the network flow-DEM method and the iterative normal-score ensemble smoother is unique and will provide a framework for assessing the uncertainty of fracturing propagation due to the heterogeneity of lithology in geothermal engineering systems. The method will be designed to be scalable for other geothermal projects and provide important societal benefits of more efficient geothermal engineering design. This project will foster collaboration among the PI, INL, and industry in a range of potential projects such as carbon sequestration and deep borehole waste disposal, and will fill gaps in the field of geomechanical modeling at the PI's home institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this study, faculty and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound 1  in Cameroon. Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments. Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.<br/><br/>This IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model. Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research topics and graduate student theses. A goal of our IRES program is to attract underrepresented minority students and mentor them to develop self-confidence, independent and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in a research and in careers in the geosciences. By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.<br/><br/>Carbon in estuaries are an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date, there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period, US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping) that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium) affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest are the classroom messages and instructional tasks in classrooms that have discouraged women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with special needs from pursuing careers in STEM fields. This project is a collaboration between researchers and teachers in the United States and Finland that: 1) measures the academic, social, and emotional learning of students in secondary science classes; 2) investigates the effect of the implementation of a new form of science instruction modeled after the new Next Generation Science Standards; and 3) creates an integrated exchange program between the United States and Finland for students, teachers, teacher educators, researchers, and policy leaders to foster the professional development of science teachers and improvement of teacher education programs. The planned educational exchange program will involve teams of U.S. teacher educators, science teachers, and science teacher interns traveling to Finland in order to exchange research findings and teaching expertise with their Finnish counterparts. It is anticipated that these exchanges will expand participants? networks providing them more sources of information to elevate the professionalism of teachers and deepen their STEM knowledge. <br/><br/>To capitalize on science activities in secondary chemistry and physics classrooms in the United States and Finland that have been shown through prior research to enhance engagement and learning, the project will create an instructional intervention which advances reforms in science education, specifically project based learning, and compares it with conventional science instructional techniques. Using both innovative single case study design and smartphone technology this research will test when students participate in the instructional intervention do they experience an increase in science relevance both for themselves and society and science learning? Working with teachers, four science units will be created and replicated over a three year period (with additional new schools, teachers, and students in each successive year). By the end of year three a larger field test will be conducted in which the intervention will be implemented in 40 classrooms in twenty treatment high schools affecting nearly 2,000 students representing diverse backgrounds (with matched control populations).

Emerging industrial platforms such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet (II) in the US and Industrie 4.0 in Europe have tremendously accelerated the development of new generations of CPS that integrate humans and human organizations with physical and computation processes (H-CPS) and extend to societal-scale systems such as traffic networks, electric grids, or networks of autonomous systems (self-driving cars, unmanned air vehicles) where control is dynamically shifted between humans and machines. Societal-scale systems are motivated by societal needs, but must conform to social norms and respond to expectations. If these systems evolve independently in the US and other countries, they will ""hard-wire"" the social context in which they are created, making interoperation hard or impossible, decreasing reusability of results, and narrowing markets for products and services. While impacts of new technology trends on social policies have received attention, the other side of the coin - to make systems adaptable to social policies - is nearly absent from engineering and computer science curricula and design practice. The project brings together a large, interdisciplinary group of researchers from Vanderbilt University, UC Berkeley, Technical University of Munich and University of Oldenburg working on integrated dynamics of humans, human organizations and networked CPS components, systems science foundations for resilient H-CPS, high-confidence design of H-CPS with learning enabled components, and social science. The goal of the project is to develop technologies that can be adapted to varying public policies. The international collaboration exposes students to H-CPS design which is strongly contextual and provides practical experience with the required scientific and technical foundations.  The education goal is to lay the foundation for and collect experience with new engineering and computer science education constructs that prepares students for the design and operation of a new generation of policy-aware H-CPS applications. The experience gained via the joint US and German research collaboration will be generalized and extended to broader international context.<br/>The central technical goal of this joint research activity is to establish foundations for constructing H-CPS systems that can be parameterized by social context.  Our technical approach is three-fold: (1) Understand and compare the nature, scope, and evolution of policies and societal expectations in the operation of societal-scale H-CPS in the US and in Europe. The purpose of the analysis is not to shape social policies, but to determine which factors have the greatest influence on technical solutions. (2) Investigate methods for the explicit and formal representation of societal context (operational, privacy, safety, security policies, incentives, pricing and market policies) that are machine interpretable and impact the structure and behavior of H-CPS. (3) Develop policy-aware architectures that guarantee the enforcement of policy requirements during the operation of a new generation of H-CPS. The expected outcomes of the proposed research program are: (1) H-CPS architecture specifications that can be ?parameterized? by operational, safety and security policies, and by constraints emerging from societal expectations, (2) policy model repositories, (3) design tool chains, and (4) test beds. The international project team will evaluate research results in low-altitude air traffic control, smart-grid and intelligent transportation system testbeds."

The proposed international collaboration<br/>will provide an unparalleled research environment for students, exposing them to the forefront of scientific challenges and technological innovations from an international podium. The projects will encourage the participation of underrepresented groups by leveraging the Vanderbilt-Fisk bridge program and by actively recruiting minority students.

The host Japanese groups will also likely to benefit not only from the research outcomes but through the international cultural exchange and experience.<br/><br/>The US students will pursue time-dependent simulations of electron and ion dynamics in nanomaterials using novel atomistic quantum mechanical approaches. These investigations will be frontier applications of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanical calculations to describe interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, electron transport and scattering and physics of ultracold atoms. The results of these simulations will be valuable in evaluating the experiments probing new frontiers of material science.<br/><br/>In collaboration with Japanese research groups, researchers from VU have developed a linear scaling atomistic approach to simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecules, solids, and nanostructures in time-dependent external fields. The approach allows for the simulation of electron and ion dynamics in systems containing thousands of atoms, incorporating the effect of electromagnetic fields by coupling the time-dependent Maxwell and Schrodinger equations. The participating students will use these computer simulations tools to study various systems, including high harmonics generation in solids, interaction of laser pulses and 2D materials, ionization and fragmentation of molecules by circularly polarized light, low energy scattering of electrons and biomolecules, and other interesting cases.

In addition to the intrinsic archival value of these materials, they are also models for understanding property degradation over long periods of time.  This project aims to develop computational and experimental tools needed to understand how these changes take place. To accomplish this task a research network has been established between Northwestern University and leaders in cultural heritage science from the Rijksmuseum  and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the National Research Council in Italy, and the Synchrotron Soleil in France. This new infrastructure promises to deliver a significant enhancement of research and education resources (networks, partnership and increased access to facilities and instrumentation) to a diverse group of users.  The art objects central to the project provide a series of well-defined case studies for investigating complex materials systems that are both applicable to materials education and push the limits of the existing analytical tools, thus inspiring instrumental innovations across broad sectors of the physical sciences.  Further development of these tools will enable art conservators to more effectively make informed decisions about treatments of works of art, and to understand long-term materials degradation more generally.  The project will also deliver a significant enhancement of research and education infrastructure by a diverse group of users and will provide meaningful, international research experience to 50 participants, with a strong emphasis on scientists at the beginning of their careers. In addition, the connections between science and art will illustrate the creative aspects of both disciplines to a very broad audience, attracting a more representative cross section of people into science.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The purpose of the proposed program is to probe the properties of heterogeneous material composites at multiple length scales, with a focus on the materials used in creating works of art. The grand challenge is to understand the coupling of material structures from nano- to macro- length scales to the visual appearance, and to use this coupling as a probe of material properties. This coupling will be addressed by incorporating light/matter interactions into computational chemistry approaches, which will also be developed to understand the physical-chemical changes that occur in materials over long periods of time. This information can be used to reconstruct the appearance of an object as originally created, and project the appearance into the future. This methodology is of primary importance to the art conservation community, which has developed advanced research infrastructures in Europe that are rare or nonexistent in the U.S. These European resources are essential for the completion of the project goals, which are to provide a greater understanding of the way in which chemical and physical changes within a material gradually distort its visual perception, and to develop a mechanistic understanding of these alteration pathways. The proposed PIRE project integrates teams from leading cultural heritage science institutes in France, the Netherlands and Italy with their American Counterparts. While the tools will be applicable to modern engineered materials as well, examples from art provide a much broader educational impact. A combination of individual and cohort visits to the three primary international sites will provide students with an international perspective on science and research, while building skills in communicating the role of science in society."

However, less than 1% of microbes have been successfully isolated for detailed study in laboratory cultures, using traditional microbiology tools. Although newer ?meta-omics? research tools circumvent the need for laboratory cultivation by analyzing the molecular composition of entire microbial communities, these tools often blend information from highly diverse organisms, making it difficult to directly link the function of specific microbes (the ?phenome?) to their DNA code (the ?genome?). This project will tackle this technological weakness through a new combination of approaches that directly links functional and genomic properties of individual microbial cells. This new approach combines the project team?s ability to sequence the DNA of individual cells with the utilization of specific compounds that microbes incorporate in their cells in proportion to specific biological activities, such as respiration, growth, and uptake of nutrients. The researchers will validate this new approach in environments ranging from the Gulf of Maine to ocean crust and deep continental subsurface. This project will leverage genome research facilities at the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center in Maine, expertise in the synthesis of fluorescent organic probes at the University of New Hampshire, continental geomicrobiology infrastructure at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, and ongoing oceanographic research programs in Maine and New Hampshire. The project will contribute to the development of novel analytical capabilities for the national Research and Development (R&D) community, creation of new jobs, and training of skilled workforce in all three jurisdictions.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>This award is for a multi-jurisdictional project that will capitalize on existing pilot results to achieve a breakthrough in microbial genome-to-phenome methodology at the most fundamental level of biological organization: the single cell. The overarching objective is to tie cell-specific genome data to expressed functions such that rates of environmental processes can be coupled to specific microbial lineages. The research team will: a) develop a new, integrated workflow for genome-to-phenome analyses of individual cells that takes advantage of fluorescent compounds to measure phenotypes; b) validate and utilize this workflow in studies of globally significant environments; c) share novel research tools with the research community through publications and core facility services; d) improve sustainable research infrastructure at collaborating EPSCoR jurisdictions; and e) create a multifaceted workforce development program to ensure expertise in these new research approaches. The project will establish and verify this workflow through three case studies that leverage the team?s expertise and access to environments of differing microbiome complexity: the coastal ocean, the deep dark ocean, and the marine and terrestrial subsurface. To further expand the societal impact and technological potential of the project, an added pilot study will focus on characterization of individual microbes responsible for degradation of an environmental contaminant (polyacrylamide/acrylamide). The overarching broader impact will be the development of a new tool: a pipeline for linking phenotype information to single microbial cells. This will have broad applicability across research communities and industrial applications and address a societal need to understand the critical function of microbes in the environment. The project will leverage the Bigelow Laboratory?s capabilities in single cell genomics and flow cytometry, New Hampshire?s expertise in the marine biogeochemistry of polymers and the synthesis of labeled organic molecules, and the Desert Research Institute?s (DRI) expertise and infrastructure in studying deep subsurface environments.

Plants evolve to produce new toxic chemicals while herbivores, and their associated microbial communities, change such that they become more tolerant to plant toxins. The understanding of plant toxins and herbivore tolerance is important for conservation biologists that manage native herbivores and plants, for the ranching and agricultural community that rely on plants to feed livestock and chemicals to defend crops from pests, and the medical community that relies on plant-derived chemicals to manage human health. A better understanding of these important plant-herbivore systems will require the expertise of many scientists with different specializations that must cooperate across state boundaries. This project will leverage, build, and integrate research and education strengths across Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming to identify the Genomes Underlying Toxin Tolerance (GUTT) in vertebrate herbivores. The GUTT team will integrate a range of expertise to identify how variation in toxin tolerance influences populations of wild mammalian and avian herbivores. The team will work with high school teachers and use Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences in introductory biology, chemistry, and math courses to train, inspire, recruit, and retain a diverse workforce capable of applying genetic understanding of toxin tolerance in animals and microbes to conservation, agriculture and human health. The project will also connect GUTT participants with local agency and industry partners to diversify career and funding opportunities for faculty and students. The research and educational activities will increase the capacity for Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming faculty, students, and community partners to more effectively manage toxic plants and the animals and microbes that interact with these plants.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project identifies the Genomes Underlying Toxin Tolerance (GUTT) by establishing the links between molecular and physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance that predict demographic consequences in vertebrate herbivores. The researchers use metabolomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and molecular modeling to identify molecular interactions between herbivore and gut microbial genomes and toxic chemicals ingested by herbivores. The team will use  in vivo and in vitro experiments to quantify physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance and physiological consequences of toxin exposure. Participants will also work on manipulating molecular and physiological mechanisms of toxin tolerance to develop, validate, and iteratively refine models that predict how toxin exposure influences herbivore demography. The research will result in: 1) An unprecedented, detailed view of concerted herbivore and microbial response to, and modification of, toxins in the herbivore gut that influence demographic rates of native vertebrate herbivores; 2) Discovery and archiving of chemical, genetic, and microbial diversity from unique interactions created in the guts of mammalian and avian herbivores consuming diverse plant chemicals; and 3) Workforce development programs that create and sustain a culture of inclusion for marginalized groups across all career stages who can innovate and lead new frontiers in integrated research and educational practices. High school outreach programs and interactions with predominantly undergraduate institutions will be used to inspire the next generation of scientists. Rentention of these students will be ensured through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences throughout the undergraduate curriculum where students use genetic and chemical data to discover novel mechanisms and consequences of toxin tolerance. Overall, the Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming EPSCoR RII Track-2 GUTT team will foster novel collaborations and contribute to society by predicting and managing how wild, agricultural, and human systems respond molecularly, physiologically, and demographically to chemicals in plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these embedded devices in vehicles are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks, such as modifying the in-vehicle system infrastructure, stealing intellectual property (IP), and misusing the vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Fundamental advancements are needed at the hardware and software levels to create a more reliable vehicle security infrastructure. This research investigates the potential use of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) as a hardware security approach to simplify or solve many important vehicular security problems, such as ECU piracy, ECU counterfeiting, secure authentication, and key management. Collaborators at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have the needed expertise in PUFs, and the project will provide the PI with needed training and mentorship in this area. The proposed research could pave the way for the widespread use of photovoltaic-based PUFs to mitigate vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the impacts of potential attacks, thereby, increasing the public safety of American families and securing driver's personal data. In addition, the project will lead to a stronger research and education program in vehicular security at the University of Kentucky and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The project will provide the foundation for a long-term research program to design hardware security primitives based on intrinsic properties of existing vehicular hardware such as built-in sensors or devices. Building PUFs from existing vehicular hardware has the potential to mitigate cyber-threats in vehicles with minimal redesign costs and performance penalties. Photovoltaic (PV) devices have wide applications in vehicles such as ambient climate control, automatic headlights, to generate electricity in hybrid and electric vehicles, etc. Therefore, the PI plans to investigate new designs and prototypes of PV PUFs for vehicular security. The proposed research will provide a better understanding of the relationship between light intensity and output current in PV devices for the generation of PV PUFs. Novel methodologies and circuit architectures of PV-based PUFs will be designed, and the reliability of the proposed PUFs with respect to temperature variations and aging effects will be tested and evaluated under extreme meteorological test conditions. Simulation and prototyping of PV-based PUF circuits will test the PI's hypothesis that existing devices and sensors in vehicles can be used to mitigate the security threats. Intellectual products will be developed, such as novel circuit designs and architectures of PV-based PUFs, design flow of PV-based PUF generation, and specific PUF designs and prototypes."

ASGM is common in mineral rich developing countries. This type of mining produces about 30% of the gold in the world used in jewelry, finances, electronics, aerospace, and medicine. ASGM causes large-scale deforestation, air/water contamination, and chronic human diseases, especially from the mercury used to process the ore. Despite these impacts, ASGM is a critical livelihood strategy for millions of people worldwide. Existing efforts to introduce sustainable ASGM practices, primarily through mercury-free processing technologies, have not achieved long-term sustainability because they are believed by miners to be inefficient or uneconomical. This project will break this trend by educating US engineers to co-design, implement and evaluate sustainable and culturally appropriate ASGM technologies and practices with miners and affected communities in Colombia and Peru. For the first time, US engineering faculty and students will work with Colombian and Peruvian faculty, students, and mining communities to develop improved technologies and techniques, coupled with social organizations, to make ASGM cleaner, safer, and more sustainable. While tackling this complex international problem, this project will contribute to developing a global US engineering workforce.<br/><br/>ASGM systems are simultaneously social, technical, and ecological, involving miners and communities, geologic deposits, ecosystems, technologies, and scientific and engineering expertise.

Using a combination of social science, human-centered design, and engineering methods, this project will make at least 4 key scholarly contributions: 1) identifying the local knowledge that miners and affected communities hold on mercury exposure, on techniques for minimizing this exposure, and on environmental remediation strategies; 2) advancing engineering and social science research on the role of local knowledge in participatory environmental monitoring; 3) widening the ASGM social science and engineering literatures to include remediation; 4) testing criteria for Engineering for Sustainable Community Development in the real world. This project will also test how engineering students from two different educational models (training in humanitarian engineering vs. expanded curriculum in the humanities & social sciences) compare in how they understand the social context of engineering and how they work with non-US peers and communities. Through the project's affiliation with the Alliance for Responsible Mining, the Governors' Climate and Forests Task Force, and the networks of its Advisory Board, the project can expand its impact beyond Colombia and Peru into other countries as well as beyond gold mining into other minerals like cobalt."

It empowered our military prowess, and enabled civilian aircraft to fly half way around the world. Further advancement in the operating temperature of gas turbines made with metallic materials, however, is limited by their melting points. So the next phase must be based upon high-temperature ceramics. These high-tech materials for gas turbine engines are composites of ceramic fibers infiltrated with a ceramic matrix, both made of non-oxide ceramics such as silicon carbide. The fibers, which are the foundation of this ceramic matrix composite (CMC) technology, are generally derived through thermal decomposition of organosilicon polymers. The CMCs hold the promise of quantum leaps in the operating temperature of gas turbines, which may increase engine thrust by 25% while decreasing fuel consumption by 10% just within the next few years. Unfortunately, the United States is far behind Japan and Europe that lead the science and technology of processing and innovation in non-oxide fiber fabrication. To make the US competitive this PIRE program will expand research in the basic science and technology and train professionals with expertise in fiber processing and properties. The program will leverage the relationships that researchers in the US have established with their counterparts overseas. Specifically, the US PIRE team members will bring expertise in structure and thermo-chemo-mechanical property characterization of polymer-derived ceramics (PDC), whereas international partners will offer expertise in pre-ceramic polymers and non-oxide ceramic fibers. Together they will train the next generation of students in this crucial area of materials science and engineering. Seven to ten doctoral and twenty undergraduate research scholars from the US will receive training on ceramic fiber research via dual degree programs and exchange visits to PIRE member institutions in Japan and Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy). The community built under this program will include young researchers comprising of at least 50% female, underrepresented and first-generation-to-attend-college students. They will serve as the backbone for continued innovation and scientific research on ceramic fibers far into the future. The research team foresees that the fiber program will evolve into a full-fledged CMC program, where the matrix and the fibers are manufactured from polymers in the United States, within a decade.<br/><br/>The research component of this PIRE project will focus on developing the next generation multi-component PDC fibers of carefully selected compositions within the Si/C/N/O systems through systematic understanding of structure-property-processing correlations, leading to superior properties. Key aspects of the project are: (a) design of new pre-ceramic polymers suitable for drawing fibers, (b) thermolysis of pre-ceramic polymers to obtain multi-component ceramic fibers with desired morphology, chemical stability and microstructure, (c) measurements of creep and thermochemical properties, and (d) modeling of the oxidation behavior of ceramic fibers. Ab-initio calculations will be performed to correlate experimental measurements, such as from high temperature calorimetry, to the nanostructure of ceramic fibers. Further, economic evaluation and the impact of PDC fiber manufacture on resources will be assessed to determine the implications and viability of new, science-based technologies at the earliest stages. Successful completion of the project will thus lead to: (i) the creation of new US-based CMC science and technology, (ii) a cadre of undergraduate and graduate students who will implement this know-how in US academia, industry and national laboratories, and (iii) a vibrant international community that through its diversity will greatly accelerate progress in this critical field."

The project seeks to merge water and energy concerns with appropriate cultural models of local knowledge, institutions, and resource limits. It also seeks to initiate a cultural shift in individual and university research and education programs by developing international research competence and building capacity through global partnerships.  Engineering systems will be adapted to environmental and cultural changes associated with growth in human populations, urbanization, and resource consumption by focusing on the interstices of geographical context, cultural analysis, and how the scale of implementation of a solution impacts results.  The overarching research question is: can effective, geographically-appropriate, and culturally relevant engineered systems be established that utilize wastewater as a resource for recovery of energy, water, and nutrients.<br/> The project will be carried out by a team of researchers from engineering, anthropology, marine science, and science education to enable a new integrated, interdisciplinary model in context sensitive implementation of synergistic water-energy systems.  Their combined expertise and perspective will be applied to explore the viability of two technologies to manage wastewater: anaerobic digestion and algal-based resource recovery.  Two specific research tasks address advancing the methods and materials involved in the technologies themselves, and steps needed to be taken to protect human health; two other tasks explore these technologies in the context of geographical location and environmental impacts; and the remaining two tasks focus on comprehensive systems research across social, economic, and environmental domains through life cycle assessment and systems dynamics modeling. <br/> The project will involve academic partners from Europe (U.K., The Netherlands, Czech Republic) and the Caribbean Basin (U.S. Virgin Islands, Belize, Mexico), providing a range of expertise in technological innovation, cultural histories, and geographic locations, in order to address integrated resource management challenges due to differences of scale, political will, environmental worldview, level of interest, and financial constraint.  Caribbean Basin partners will provide opportunities to investigate deployment and sustainability of technology and management strategies that take place at different stages of economic development and population density.  The three European partners are located in areas with examples of integrated resource recovery, allowing the team to develop solutions where water and energy infrastructure are highly developed and serve higher population densities.<br/> These education and research partnerships will create an international team of at least 40 undergraduate and 60 graduate students, 4 postdoctoral research associates, and 31 faculty members, who will immerse themselves in issues of national and global importance.  The application of research to international locations will provide social, economic, and environmental contrast for students and early career researchers.  The educational activities will help develop global competency and knowledge of sustainable systems, and provide participants with opportunities to participate in international partnerships.  Education and research opportunities are also provided to students from the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), a historically black university with BS programs in math and basic and environmental science, but limited research opportunities.  A collaborative undergraduate program with UVI will broaden access of under-represented minority students to career opportunities in engineering, and provide a dual degree option and opportunities for student research.  In addition, existing and planned Peace Corps graduate school partnerships will utilize the Peace Corps? unique training in language, culture, participatory approaches to community assessment, and sustainable development to build global competency.<br/> This project is jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.

These problems are increasingly global in nature and transcend political boundaries. The only effective way to solve these global challenges is for scientists to engage in international collaborations to find solutions; however, doing this is not a trivial task. How can we find and contact collaborators from foreign countries? Where do we obtain the resources to support international projects? How can communication with foreign scientist be productive despite language and culture barriers? Few graduate academic programs provide guidance or training in conducting international research. The Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) has developed the Limnology and Oceanography Research Exchange (LOREX) program to address this deficiency. Over the next 3 years ASLO will offer an international research engagement program for graduate level professional development in limnology and oceanography. This program will provide all graduate student society members training in designing and coordinating international collaborative research through seminars, workshops and web-based materials. In addition, thirty student members will be selected each year to apply this knowledge and carry out research projects that they design in collaboration with scientists from one of several collaborating limnologic and marine institutes overseas (Australia, Sweden, Israel and Canada) which represent different aquatic systems and related challenges.

It focuses on advancing secondary school teachers' motivation and ability to lead their students in science fair projects, and develop a long-term appreciation for the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning. The five-year program targets rural, high-need schools, and economically disadvantaged students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups. The high quality, competitive, inquiry-based science fair projects lead students through a strong STEM pipeline leading to increased participation in higher education and potentially STEM careers.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The project goals are to: (1) establish a network of STEM teachers and area administrators that pro-actively engage students in project-based learning and give them access to university resources and guidance to empower inquiry-based STEM learning; (2) increase the number of students from underrepresented groups in rural Alabama that participate in high-quality science fair projects; (3) develop a sustainable relationship between Auburn University and local public schools for continued growth beyond the scope of the project; and (4) increase positive student attitudes towards STEM through exposure to higher education, career options, and interactions with university research mentors. To accomplish these goals, the project leadership engages middle and high school teachers and administrators from vertically aligned schools (e.g., a middle school that feeds into a specific high school) in professional development workshops that focus on science and engineering fair project development and hosting local science fair competitions. Teachers and students develop high-quality science fair projects using university laboratories and faculty guidance.  Trained teachers and administrators become agents of expanding the network and establishing a STEM culture in their schools.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The project leverages Auburn University?s College of Sciences and Mathematics Outreach Center activities to establish partnerships between Auburn University science and engineering faculty and high-need public schools in southeast Alabama. Over 720 students, 48 science teachers, and 12 administrators from 34 school districts are gaining access to Auburn University research facilities and faculty expertise in developing high-quality science fair projects. The program promotes a culture of project-based STEM learning and positive STEM identity among students who might not consider STEM higher education as an option. The model of university and local school system interaction to enhance URM interest and engagement in STEM higher education can be scaled and replicated nationwide."

As a Member of the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey for the academic year 2018-19, the PI intends to continue ongoing ethnographic research on the relationship between fossil fuel disasters and environmental protections, synthesize findings in direct conversation with leading scholars from across the social sciences, and finish a book length manuscript on the place of the environment in the tumultuous present. With sites ranging from the history of pollution and landmark legislation on clean air and clean water in the United States to present day venues working to measure and manage hydrocarbon pollution, this book describes how the negative ecologies of fossil fuels help draw the coordinates of the environment into effective scientific and political relief. Although fossil fuels loom large in present concerns over climate change, the longer history of petro-problems and environmental protections is often neglected. This understudied relation has serious implications for the resurgent place of environmental concerns in theory and politics today. <br/>?<br/>??<br/>Technical Description<br/>In advocacy, science, and governance, the environment has become a vital field of knowledge and responsibility in the contemporary. While much is done with the environment, less attention has focused on the emergence of the environment itself as a converging field of action for advocacy, science, and regulation. The research describes how the environment gained potent empirical and ethical definition in response to the problems of fossil fuels from the 1960s to the present, and explores the implications of this neglected relationship for theory, politics, and people today. To a striking degree the specific crisis that the environment realized, the forms of understanding and responsibility it authorized, and the horizons of action and anticipation it routinized all bear the imprint of hydrocarbon afterlives. Whether by way of urban smog or petrochemical runoff or even oil spills, as fossil fuels unravel the conditions of life they also instigate new state authority to monitor and police those conditions. Yet the resulting definition of the defendable environment, wedged in between hydrocarbon excess and public outrage, has often been effective to the extent it sidesteps the underlying petro-problems and focuses attention instead on stabilizing the mediums of exposure, like clean air and clean water, and perhaps now a stable climate. This has serious consequence, for not only has the environment been designed to divorce measures of harm from measures of gain but the category has found its most forceful definition through moralizing and managing an ahistorical, moderately contaminated, and exceedingly technical understanding of legitimate life. Today, as the disruptions of fossil fuels snap back into focus around rising planetary concerns like global warming, ocean acidification, and the so-called Anthropocene, this history of our present is significant not only for its previous neglect but also for its reworking of environmental crisis and critique today. As the first faculty member from Bennington College to be invited to IAS, this work will also raise the intellectual profile of the PI's home institution, stimulate ambitious research agendas among faculty and students while improving infrastructures of support for such work, and catalyze new research among current collaborators, both at the home institution and beyond.<br/>?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, national security practitioners typically do not have the structures, opportunities, or clear incentives to have longer-term engagement with a broad range of research agendas and findings. The national security community typically engages with environmental scholars through commissioned applied research targeted at specific ongoing problems and the findings of this work are often proprietary. Therefore, both environmental researchers and national security practitioners have limited understandings of the connections between their domains.

By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 5%. Urbanization is one of the most significant forms of habitat change, resulting in biodiversity loss through local extinction processes. Urban expansion is expected to impact 25% of all endangered species in the next decade. The overall objective of this project is to investigate how some animals are able to thrive in urban environments while others are not, with a particular focus on how the natural stress response of some birds allows them to respond to factors such as light, noise, and pollution. This stress response differs between individuals that live in urban versus rural areas. This project will determine whether the stress response is genetically inherited by studying house sparrows living in a range of urban and urban settings. There is increasing global effort to build more environmentally-friendly cities, which may reduce stress levels of humans living in densely populated areas. Basic knowledge on how individuals adapt to city life can guide such strategies. The PI will visit a laboratory at Princeton University to learn the genetic techniques required for this project. Increasing her competence in modern molecular genetics through cooperation with Princeton will both establish an important new collaboration, and will significantly contribute to development of her career at the University of Nevada at Reno.  In addition, a number of outreach activities are planned, such as the involvement of citizen scientists who will learn about the research process through collection of data from urban nest box studies.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Urbanization affects biological systems worldwide. Phenotypic differences between urban and rural populations demonstrate that some individuals have adapted to city life while others are displaced. A key trait facilitating adaptation is the degree to which animals respond to stress. This stress response has a heritable component and exhibits intra-individual plasticity. However, the mechanisms behind this variability and whether they might be responsible for adaptation to different environments are not known. The overarching hypothesis guiding this work is that an epigenetic mechanism, specifically DNA methylation, is responsible for modifying an individual?s stress response to environmental pressures. Variation in DNA methylation is a prime candidate to explain how organisms adapt to urban environments. Using house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from a gradient of urbanized habitats, the PI will first examine urban-rural differences in DNA methylation patterns at specific candidate genes and relate these patterns to the stress response. To unravel if differences in the stress response are due to heritable adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, an unprecedented cross-fostering field experiment will be integrated with multi-generational screening of the stress phenotype and methylation patterns. This experiment disentangles the contribution of genes, expression, and environmental effects across generations to variation in the stress response. By linking the fields of urban ecology, endocrinology, and epigenetics, this project will pioneer insights into the epigenetic variation underlying a physiological response. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind observed phenotypic differences will enable us to better assess the potential for adaptation of animals to city life, and thereby the impact of urbanization on wild populations. The information acquired is becoming essential in a world that is increasingly experiencing the stress of urbanization."

Beyond tragic loss of life and property associated with extreme events of the past two decades, wildfire trends also prompt growing concerns with health impacts from biomass smoke.  Notably, the high concentration of particulate matter, also known as aerosols is of particular concern for human health effects, atmospheric visibility impacts, and the planetary radiation budget.  Smoke aerosols are highly diverse in terms of their size, chemical composition, shape and optical properties.  This research examines these properties in laboratory combustion experiments using relevant fuels as well as ambient measurements of smoke aerosols.  A particular focus is how these particles interact with atmospheric relative humidity, which changes these optical properties.  In the end, parameters measured here are important to understanding the magnitude and extent of smoke impacts; these are also key inputs needed in computer models that predict smoke impacts on air quality and the climate system.  The study under this fellowship will allow unparalleled opportunities for the career advancement of the PI and a student.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Biomass burning aerosols increasingly degrade global air quality and remain poorly constrained with respect to climate effects. The Southwestern U.S. lacks detailed measurements of fundamental smoke properties for relevant fuels, for both endemic and invasive species.  This project addresses these gaps with laboratory experiments on biomass burning emissions with a focus on aerosol water uptake, or hygroscopicity.  The research focuses on laboratory aerosol measurements of biomass smoke?from emission to aging exploring the dynamics between aerosol hygroscopicity, optical properties, and chemical composition. Specific goals of this research are: (1) Explore the connection of aerosol hygroscopicity to fuels and soils, (2) Refine a new technique for measuring humidity dependence of aerosol light extinction using the Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift-Single Scattering Albedo (CAPS-SSA) method, (3) Use other advanced aerosol measurement techniques to describe a framework that drives smoke aerosol properties.  An array of techniques will be employed to provide unique insights to biomass smoke microphysical properties.  These include several contributed by New Mexico Tech (controlled RH nephelometry, multi-wavelength nephelometry, and a photoacoustic extinctiometer) that will be combined with resources at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). The latter includes photoacoustic spectrometry, particle size distribution methods, and advanced aerosol techniques such as aerosol mass spectrometry and a photochemical aging reactor.  A main collaborative task is the development of a new instrument, a humidified CAPS-SSA. In conjunction with traditional humidity controlled nephelometry, this will allow probing of the RH dependence of light absorption and SSA.  The latter determines whether aerosols cause a net cooling or warming impact.  This study also includes analysis of plants and soils to determine key drivers of hygroscopicity. Ultimately, the results enable development of a predictive framework of key aerosol properties from smoke, fuel, and soils composition, combustion properties and aging.  Wildfire trends as well as the Southwest U.S. region's changing forest ecosystems, a hydrological connection, and scarce data in this region make this an important topic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the demand for large bandwidth and high data rate for mobile applications is at all-time high, future 5G (5th Generation) mobile terminals must operate at unused millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. It is also expected that existing lower frequency 4G bands will continue to be needed for wide area coverage. In this project, it is proposed to investigate the performance of a new generation of smart dispersed array antenna architecture for future 5G new radios (NRs). The mmWave arrays will be integrated into recently designed 4G/LTE multi-slot antennas for interoperability between cells of 4G networks and future 5G heterogeneous cells. This will provide a unified connectivity platform for existing and emerging connected services. This fellowship will be a unique opportunity for the PI and a graduate student to access state-of-the-art facilities and advanced fabrication equipment. The project outcomes will be utilized to attract members of minority and underrepresented groups to engineering education in the Gulf Coast region. This will also boost the University of South Alabama?s recruiting effort to attract outstanding undergraduate students, and drive up new mobile-based economic development opportunities in the Gulf Coast and in the State of Alabama.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The objective of project is to investigate the performance of 3-D dispersed antenna arrays that will be implemented in multiple planes of mobile terminals for future 5G networks, called New Radios (NRs). Orthogonal arrays dispersedly located on various planes of NRs will be studied for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) operation and beam scanning in nearly full spherical region. Miniaturized metasurface-inspired antenna array elements will be based on Dolph-Tschebysheff amplitude weighting, where excitation co-efficient of elements will be related to Tschebysheff polynomials. Smart beamforming algorithm will be developed for a fine scan step with narrow beamwidths in all planes. Two types of array elements will be integrated into a newly designed 4G multi-slot-based MIMO antenna system that will enable NRs to operate in almost all 4G/LTE bands, and multiple mmWave bands, such as 28 GHz and 39 GHz. This will enable NRs with a harmonized connectivity platform for existing and future wireless services. Dispersed arrays, equipped with advanced beamforming and associated feed networks will be developed using 3D printing technology. In this collaborative project, PI Latif and a graduate student will model, simulate and design smart arrays, and implement several prototypes and evaluate the MIMO performance of both LTE and 5G antenna systems. The proposed project will provide the PI a strong platform to develop a thriving research program at the University of South Alabama with a long-lasting impact on his research career in the field of 5G/mmWave technology, that will be benefit other academic institutions, and wireless and auto industries in the State of Alabama.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If left unchecked, this condition can lead to tissue trauma, ulcerations, infections and ultimately amputation. Since small nerve fibers innervate small blood vessels, early detection is possible by monitoring changes in tissue perfusion and blood flow. In this project, the PI will combine diffuse optics with laser-based imaging techniques to generate person-specific heat maps capable of highlighting DPN markers that include tissue perfusion and blood flow rates in feet. A model incorporating skin tones and disorders will inform the imaging data to ensure the spatial heat maps are accurate and reliable for DPN detection. This low-cost, non-invasive approach will provide opportunities for routine monitoring, providing earlier detection of small nerve fiber damage and reducing the risk of further complications. Additionally, this project establishes collaborations between the Tilbury Biophotonics group at the University of Maine with the BOTLab at Boston University which will result in several studies. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), a common diabetic complication, is the loss of sensation particularly in the lower limbs and increases the risk of tissue trauma, resulting in ulcerations, infections and increased risk of amputation. Current screening approaches are unable to quantify early nerve damage despite the onset of several early symptoms including: burning, itching, restlessness, and poor thermal sensation. Current gold standard assays are due to cost and or degree of invasiveness suggesting that a new approach is needed. Small nerve fibers innervate both sweat glands and small arterioles and when damaged, both perspiration and blood flow characteristics are altered. Several functional small nerve fiber tests are based on the loss of perspiration and alterations of the rhythmic blood flow characteristics; yet excitement of each approach is dampened by low specificity or complications of skin tones and disorders. In this proposal we will build a three-wavelength Time Modulated Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (TM-SFDI) and Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) system for wide-field imaging of both blood flow rates and concentrations of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin. A 2-layer Monte Carlo method will minimize error due to skin tones and disorders and will also inform the selection of optimal spatial frequencies projected onto the tissue to maximize sensitivity of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Collectively, the TM-SFDI/LSCI system is a low-cost, non-invasive approach for longitudinally monitoring diabetics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the opportunity to greatly improve food security, the mechanisms that cause stalk lodging have not been established. This RII Track-2 FEC FY 2018 project entitled ""Understanding the relationship between genome and phenome"" brings together a unique team from mathematics, engineering, chemistry, genomics, and biology to provide a unique approach to solving this complex problem. Three interjurisdictional Universities, the University of Kentucky, University of Idaho, and Clemson University have leveraged their research expertise to create the Kentucky/Idaho/Clemson Plant Biomechanics Consortium (KIC-Consortium). This consortium will combine mathematical modeling with innovative technology designed to test stem strength on large populations of plants to predict the underlying features that both cause, and may be used to overcome, stem lodging. These features will be systematically used in the future to improve grain crop varieties; thus, aiding in both food and energy security. The project will provide early career opportunities and exposure to interdisciplinary research for seven early career faculty and build a robust intellectual infrastructure in this field through several training programs.<br/> <br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project will focus on stalk-lodging, a problem that has faced agriculture (maize and sorghum in particular) for decades and limits food security nationally and globally. Stalk lodging is the breakage of plant stems prior to harvest and may reduce worldwide grain yields by up to 20% annually. Improving stalk lodging by a mere 1% in maize would lead to a production increase of 20 billion pounds (~$2 billion) each year.  The genetic regulation of stalk lodging resistance has proven to be elusive. While currently available state-of-the-art genomics approaches like genome wide association (GWAS), gene co-expression networks, and expression quantitative locus (eQTL) analyses have been successful in linking specific genes/variants/transcripts to specific phenotypes, they tend to either underestimate (missing heritability), or overestimate genome-to-phenome interactions. A more flexible mathematical/statistical framework capable of capturing complex multiscale, nonlinear interactions and functional relationships will provide a comprehensive picture of genome-to-phenome relationships. The proposed interjurisdictional plant biomechanics consortium involving the University of Kentucky, the University of Idaho, and Clemson University (KIC-Consortium) is focused on the hypothesis that the relationship between a genome and phenotypic traits is governed by complex functional relationships and nonlinear interactions existing at multiple temporal and spatial scales. To pursue this hypothesis, the KIC-Consortium will develop a multiscale, multiphysics modeling framework that is flexible enough to account for sophisticated nonlinear interactions and that utilizes advanced statistical methods, finite element methods, and intermediate phenotype data typically excluded from genome-to-phenome mapping efforts.

This work will focus on understanding the initiation of epileptic brain seizures and longer-term impacts on brain function such as memory. Epileptic seizures directly impact roughly 1% of humans, and have indirect impacts on loved ones and caregivers as well as economic impacts on society. Epilepsy has been called a ?window to brain function? because the condition impairs different brain functions depending on the location of the seizure in the brain and the impacted network of neurons, and because it provides a unique opportunity to study an impaired brain?s function over time and space. The project will develop minimally invasive implantable sensors that can be used for monitoring before, during, and for several months following seizure events. Researchers will relate changes occurring during seizure events with those observed in the intervals between events. The project includes hiring four new faculty, design and purchase of equipment, development of new undergraduate and graduate courses, recruitment and training of a diverse student population to better reflect the regional community, and new student research and workforce opportunities. <br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>The activities of the team across three institutions (Louisiana Tech University, the University of Arkansas, and the University of Alabama) are organized under four thrust areas that focus on recording and analysis of electrical activity, magnetic activity, neurochemical and optical signals, and memory function of the brain. A series of coordinated and synergistic investigations will be conducted using innovative methods and tools designed to probe brain function at the molecular, cellular, and macro levels in epileptic rats and human subjects. Patients with focal epilepsy, during their presurgical evaluation, will undergo implantation of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) electrodes for subsequent long-term (days) recording and monitoring of their spontaneous seizures. Non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging is also used to provide important complementary information on the electromagnetic activity of the brain.

These programs are designed to increase students' scientific content knowledge and skills, promote STEM engagement, increase self-efficacy, and prepare underserved and underrepresented minority high school students for success in undergraduate programs. However, even after demonstrating significant knowledge gains and success in these programs, students are often unable to authenticate their knowledge gains to receive favorable consideration on college applications. In fact, there is currently no systematic credentialing mechanism to assess and validate the scientific rigor of and competency gains within STEM precollege programs for college admissions purposes. This NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot seeks to address this gap by developing and testing credentialing and badging processes for four STEM precollege programs. Working with College Admissions Officers and project partners, the University of Pittsburgh endeavors to employ a collaborative impact approach to build and document the collaborative infrastructure needed to support STEM precollege program authentication processes. This will seed the development of a networked improvement community that supports all aspects of the work from participant support to the collaborative impact to the greater network of urban education university ecosystems involved in the pilot. <br/><br/>Over a two-year period, this pilot will examine a mechanism to strengthen the STEM pathway for disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students to enter postsecondary STEM programs and eventually STEM careers. Building on two social innovation theories, the technical approach will focus on four specific aims: (1) create a community engagement framework to recruit underserved and underrepresented high school students to STEM precollege programs, (2) develop a STEM Success Matrix that identifies student competencies acquired in precollege programs that prepare students for collegiate success in STEM, (3) credential precollege programs using the STEM Success Matrix, and (4) develop a student badging system for precollege program participants using the STEM Success Matrix.  Four University of Pittsburgh STEM precollege programs will serve as the context for development and testing with support from a range of partners representing the broader Pittsburgh STEM ecosystem. Approximately 300 high school students are expected to participate in the pilot, across the four precollege programs. Data will be collected via participant surveys and interviews. Formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by an experienced, external evaluator. Shareable metrics, tools, and processes will be developed and disseminated using various platforms and mechanisms. If successful, this pilot could be transformative - changing admissions considerations by credentialing STEM precollege programs and increasing student interest and motivation in STEM through student badging. It would also transform the STEM ecosystem of underserved and underrepresented minority students by creating an important STEM pathway from precollege to undergraduate admissions and ultimately, STEM Careers. This pilot could serve as a baseline for a more expansive alliance with other urban education ecosystems or assisting others interested in establishing their own collaborative infrastructure and networked improvement community model to achieve similar results."

Despite their small size, diatoms' collective importance in marine ecosystems is immense.  They produce as much oxygen globally as all the rain forests combined.  Their glass shell (i.e. diatomaceous earth) also has many industrial applications.  Unlike land plants which grow relatively slow, diatom biomass accumulates fast and is rapidly recycled in seawater.  The recycling of diatom biomass releases 5-10 billion metric tons of carbon back into the ocean annually -a quantity of carbon which exceeds global fossil-fuel emissions.  This project will use state-of-the-art technology to examine the properties of the glass shell and determine how they affect diatom-biomass recycling.  This technology uses single-cell analysis, instead of traditional methods which require thousands of cells, thereby enabling new understanding and insight of single-cell material composition and structure.  This project will help entrench this technology into diatom-based research and provide training for a Ph.D. student.  The project collaboration with Stony Brook University based scientist will help researchers at the  Alabama-based Dauphin Island Sea Lab personnel to emerge as leaders in their subfields. Also considering the vast industrial application for diatomaceous earth, these approaches may be useful for industry.  This expertise will enable future work to serve the unique environmental research needs in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana).<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Diatoms are aquatic phytoplankton, characterized by their silica shell, which account for 20-40% of marine primary production.  Post-mortem silica dissolution liberates diatom organic matter within days or weeks after production, this equates to 5-10 Pg of carbon being recycled back into the ocean annually -a quantity of carbon which exceeds global fossil-fuel emissions.  Because the long-term fate of diatom organic matter is governed in part by whether their shell dissolves, this project aims to understand how organic matter within diatom silica affects its dissolution.  This project will move away from reliance on current methods (which require thousands of cells) and examine processes at the single-cell level.  Raman spectroscopy can provide detailed single-cell information on material composition and structure.  Sample analyses will be done at the NARMIL facility at Stony Brook University.  This facility houses the state-of-the-art instrumentation necessary to test hypotheses related to understanding how silica-encased organic matter is affected by diatom growth conditions and whether sediment-preserved diatoms share common organic-matter traits.  This project will have broader impact beyond its duration.  The PI's group will build a methodological tool set that has yet to be fully utilized in his subfield and considering the vast industrial application of diatom silica (diatomaceous earth) these approaches may be useful for industry.

This collaboration will also foster data set development and publications which will enable the Alabama-based PI to be competitive for future proposals by applying these approaches to address novel questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This rapid technological growth was enabled by the creation of new materials and efforts to fully understand their chemical and physical properties. In order to sustain this level of growth, the search for new materials must continue. This project supports collaboration between university researchers and scientists from government laboratories in this search.  In one area, fundamental research into the properties of block copolymers, a type of nanostructured rubbery plastic material, promises a new route to lithographic patterning on the nano-scale to facilitate the move from micro-electronics to nano-electronics that are faster and capable of greater data storage.  In a second area, studies on biocompatible, biodegradable, semi-crystalline polymers will reduce the need for undesirable small molecule additives to control crystallization, thereby enhancing biocompatibility and safety for use in medical applications. The project promotes scientific advancement by supporting experiments that can be conducted only in state-of-the-art national laboratories.  By nurturing close interactions between academia and government, the project trains students to connect their educational experiences to the goals of national health, prosperity, welfare, and the production of civically-mindful scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The cyclic molecular architecture endows polymer materials with unique and useful physical properties compared to linear counterparts such as smaller nanostructure domain sizes in block copolymers and greater thin film stability. These polymers show great promise as additives for endowing linear polymer systems with desirable properties.  However, the molecular level integration of linear and cyclic materials in topological blends is not well-understood.  Advanced characterization experiments made possible through this fellowship produce the fundamental knowledge necessary to understand how topological blends (linear plus cyclic polymers) can be used to (1) enhance block copolymer nanostructure properties for nanolithgraphy and (2) regulate crystallization kinetics and morphology in semi-crystalline polymer films.  These goals are achieved by revealing molecular mechanisms in these systems using resonant soft X-ray reflectivity (RSoXR) for the characterization of molecular distributions in block copolymer systems and broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) for mapping the localization components in semi-crystalline polymer blend films.  Host site visits, in which the PI and students work closely with experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, are important for understanding organization of materials at the molecular level and for sustaining long-term academic-government collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's interconnected world.<br/> <br/>The project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency gravitational waves. The IPTA currently consists of consortia from Australia, Europe, and North America, using a total of seven telescopes. In order to further increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international research experiences. The undergraduate students will be drawn from a range of U.S. institutions, including minority serving institutions and those in rural areas. They will work closely with both a U.S. graduate student also trained in IPTA research and their foreign mentor and students in the host country. The students will be trained in astrophysics, big data analysis, and radio instrumentation, preparing them for a range of careers."

While there is a high-level understanding of viral impacts on ecosystems, the details of the viral-microbe interactions are largely unknown. The ability to predict the biological and ecological features, or phenome, of any particular virus-microbe system based on DNA sequence alone is highly limited. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award seeks to advance the ability to predict the phenomic features of the viruses of microbes (VoMs) from genomic data. A collaborative team of researchers from Delaware, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Hawaii will study viruses that infect marine and freshwater phytoplankton, and viruses that infect a bacterial group that forms a symbiosis with important legume crops, most notably, soybean. Collectively, global phytoplankton populations are responsible for creating vast stores of biomass that support the nutritional needs of larger aquatic organisms. In this process phytoplankton sustain half of the oxygen within the atmosphere.  Enhanced understanding of genome to phenome links within phytoplankton viruses will aid in improving models that predict the impacts of excess carbon and nutrients on ecosystems.  Within the food supply chain, legumes, soybeans in particular, are an extraordinarily important source of plant protein supporting the nutritional needs of billions of people.  Better understanding of genome to phenome connections for viruses infecting bacterial symbionts of legumes could eventually lead to new technologies for improving the productivity of critical agronomic crops such as soybean.  The project team includes faculty, postdocs and students who will engage in collaborative research and share methodologies, best practices, and results through workshops and meetings.  Four early career faculty will be mentored by six other well-established faculty investigators.  The entire project team will prepare educational materials and provide summer camp opportunities for middle and elementary schools students.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>This RII Track-2 FEC award is for a collaborative effort among University of Delaware, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Hawaii, and Roger Williams University.  The planned research seeks to connect genomic features of viruses of microbes (VoMs) with phenotypic life-history traits and use these connections to advance scientific understanding of the role of VoMs in ecosystems.  The project team will test several genome to phoneme hypotheses in VoMs, focusing on phenomic features such as host range, burst size, latent period and infectivity.  An integrated high-throughput approach including emulsion-droplet microfluidic technologies, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatics, will be used to study viral-host systems representative of picophytoplankton, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and diazotrophic bacteria.  The project team will collect samples across environmental gradients from soybean fields, tropical oceans, and lakes, hypothesized to select for different VoM phenomic traits.  The researchers will build a new bioinformatics analysis tool known as the Viral Informatics Rulebook for Genome Organization ? VIRGO and incorporated it into an existing community resource for bioinformatic annotation of viral metagenomes known as the Viral Informatics Resource fOr Metagenome Exploration (VIROME).  Four early-career faculty members engaged in this project will be mentored by successful mid and later career faculty.  The team will work together in training postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students as well as in communicating the importance of environmental virology to diverse audiences including K-12 students and the general public."

In many locations, these systems serve only a segment of an urban area. This project will provide US students a clear understanding of the specific challenges of decentralized water systems through hands-on experiences. Students will develop sensor systems, connected through cellular networks, to form data acquisition networks that can significantly improve the understanding and operation of decentralized water systems. <br/><br/>The U.S. students and faculty team will work with five mentors from Addis Ababa University (AAU) who bring significant expertise in context-appropriate, decentralized water infrastructure and expertise. The U.S. students will be paired directly with AAU graduate students, using a peer-to-peer learning model likely to increase the technical impact and cultural exchange impacts of the project. Addis Ababa is excellent site for the proposed research. It is rapidly growing, with a strong existing decentralized water system and strong cellular networks to support the cyber-systems research. In addition, the city has need for more efficiency and further development of the water infrastructure. <br/><br/>Strong dissemination efforts are planned that should increase the impact of this project beyond the cohort of participating students.

Each year, a cohort of five U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience with collaborators at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and the University of Bonn (UBonn)  - both located in Bonn, Germany. Highlights of collaborative activities include student access to and learning from UNU-EHS, UBonn, and other international disaster risk reduction experts, student research training activities, spatial data set acquisition, and access to international scientific networks only available in Bonn. The primary student research project is to create and rigorously evaluate a Disaster Risk Reduction - Information Capacity Index (DRR-ICI). A DRR-ICI currently does not exist. The scientific purpose of the DRR-ICI is to quantify and evaluate how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities such as information availability, scale and relevancy vary within Germany and from country to country. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating unique linkages to international organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop the next generation of interdisciplinary STEM research scientists focused on disaster risk reduction and GIS. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as the DRR-ICI, will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to disaster risk reduction research and GIS potentially saving lives when disasters occur.

The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient. For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally, the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically, this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the patient-specific KAFO.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury. The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies.

These unifying concepts between culture and marine ecology make the holistic study of Pacific Island life ideal for a cross-disciplinary research experience.  The PAC-ISLEs program is a year-long research experience punctuated by a six-week trip to Oceania, where students will conduct independent research projects in marine biology and anthropology, and connect the shared themes uniting the two disciplines.

Students working with fish communities will focus mainly on the evolution and community structure of cryptobenthic reef fishes, a poorly studied group that can serve as an ideal indicator for evolutionary and contemporary change across Pacific Islands. Students working on Pacific Island anthropology will focus on aspects of culture that are directly linked to the ocean either through their material origins, or role in passing on knowledge about the ocean to future generations. Much like the biological communities of Pacific Islands, cultural items may be compared across different islands to show the history of change, local adaptation, and technological progression. When these data are analyzed and contextualized with existing and extensive biological and anthropological collections from Oceania at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, findings from PAC-ISLEs have the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biological and cultural diversity on and around Pacific Islands, while promoting an equitable exchange of knowledge between scientists and Pacific Islander communities.

The fellowship will also generate new opportunities for sustained collaboration with the host institution (Ohio State University). Findings will advance understanding of whether whole communities have the ability to respond to environmental change together, or as individual species. This information will aid in conservation and management of US forest fauna.<br/><br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>Understanding the impact of different historical events and recurrent microevolutionary processes on how co-distributed species show concerted versus independent responses to environmental change allows stronger predictions about how ecological communities will respond to future change. Such a comparative approach can probe the importance of the strength of ecological co-associations among species in constraining or facilitating their responses. As part of this fellowship, population genomic data will be generated and analyzed for a set of four southern Appalachian forest invertebrate species that together enable the impact of strength of ecological co-association on phylogeographic congruence to be assessed. The host institution (Ohio State University) will work with the PI in sequencing reduced representation libraries, computational approaches for performing downstream bioinformatics processing, and implementation of established and emerging phylogeographic analyses. The PI and host will also collaborate on developing analyses that extend the scope of comparative phylogeographic inference."

Despite their small size, these organisms can have significant impacts on their environment, which includes animal and human hosts. Modern analysis of complex populations of diverse microorganisms (the microbiome) associated with a particular environment relies on DNA extracted from samples. Analysis of such DNA can be highly complex, requiring advanced statistical techniques (bioinformatics) to unravel the structures and properties of microbiomes. This fellowship will allow the PI to work with experts at the University of California at San Diego, a leader in application of bioinformatics to ecological research. The PI will develop his own expertise in the rapidly developing field of bioinformatics, acquiring skills that he will then be able to apply to a variety of applications at his home institution (Boise State University).  This research project will study the microbiomes of the digestive systems of animals that eat sagebrush, a toxic plant. By comparing the microbiomes of digestive systems following consumption of toxic and non-toxic food, the PI and his collaborators will discover how the microbes deal with these plant-derived chemicals, which may lead to new ways to chemically synthesize plant molecules, discover new antimicrobial drugs, or combat animals that eat commercially and ecologically important plants.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Microbial DNA sequence data are accumulating rapidly, but approaches that uncover the specific functions of microbes are lagging behind. This project will conduct experiments aimed at uncovering the microbial functions that facilitate the ability of animals to eat toxic sagebrush. The PI and collaborators will collect and sequence DNA from the microbiomes of digestive tracts of these animals, and do so over time and between plants with different chemical toxins. This time-series and comparative metagenomics approach will uncover specific microbes and specific genes that enable rapid seasonal adaptation to sagebrush by pigmy rabbits, and adaptation to unique sagebrush chemical profiles in Lepidoptera caterpillars. It is hypothesized that many of the solutions employed by the microbiomes inhabiting these specific organisms will be found in other organisms around the world. In addition, the PI and collaborators will search for non-coding RNA regulatory elements that have evolved in these contexts and enable the microbes to detect and act on chemical signals. This research will advance understanding of sagebrush herbivores and herbivore specialization to toxic plants around the world. Herbivore-plant interactions such as this drive the bio-diversification of the planet, and have numerous ecological and economic consequences for people."

This knowledge will be used to empower managers to effectively adapt socio-ecological systems to climate variability and educate Oklahomans about the expected consequences of regional environmental change.  Three interlinked research focus areas are proposed to examine complex human, climate, and natural resource systems.  These are: a socio-ecological observatory network; a socio-ecological forecasting system, and a decision support system.  Each of the three components is linked with feedback loops, providing integration among the constituent parts.  The major participants in this proposal are: Oklahoma State University (OSU), the University of Oklahoma (OU), the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation (SRNF), and the University of Tulsa (TU).  OSU and OU are the state?s public Ph.D. granting institutions serving 23,500 and 22,600 students respectively , TU is a Ph.D. granting private institution serving approximately 4,000 students and SRNF is an independent non-profit institute that moves science and innovation from the laboratory to agricultural producers.

The proposed activities enable Oklahoma to examine socio-ecological feedback loops, to study the connections between different scales of analysis (e.g., community, landscape), and to consider whether proposed solutions for sustainability can be applied at levels where effective social or ecological changes can occur.  Research activities support the development of decision support systems that provide information for stakeholders regarding their vulnerability and options to respond to an increasingly variable and changing climate.  The majority of activities are focused on drought, complementing existing State activities within the areas of hydrology, ecology, and meteorological sciences. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Oklahoma EPSCoR develops research and education activities to engage a wide number of constituents.  STEM activities are directed at providing research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, STEM activity kits for girls through the girl scouts of America, and summer internships among other activities.  Some of these activities specifically recruite females, Native Americans, and other minorities, while K-12 activities focus on rural populations.  Education pedagogy specialists will assist K-12 teachers in translating thematic science content into classroom lessons that are shared virtually across the state.  The Oklahoma EPSCoR website and social media are used to provide a clearinghouse for information such as climate-related brochures, videos, and classroom resources, event information, and funding opportunities.  The activities particularly focus on engaging Native Americans in both research and education.  Tribal liaisons (federal, state, and tribal employees) and anthropologists will be engaged to ensure that research questions are inclusive of the views and needs of tribal environmental specialists.

Only 4% of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including: increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and students at North Carolina A&T University (NCA&T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships that create the conditions for joint global projects. <br/><br/>Ethiopia serves as an ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied. The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&T, Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between NCA&T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications, including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships between regional air quality and climate change."

The specific research focuses on the preparation of a series of specialized compounds that present carbohydrates in a precise fashion to study fundamental carbohydrate-protein interactions. These interactions are important because they play critical roles in a number of biological processes from cell communication to microbial infectivity and cancer. Despite their importance, many questions remain as to how the precise presentation of carbohydrates impacts their ability to be recognized by proteins, and how the resulting carbohydrate-protein interaction impacts downstream biological events. The research outlined in this award aims to address this knowledge gap while simultaneously providing valuable research opportunities in a high-impact international research setting. Undergraduate participants will receive training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that will enhance their education and prepare them for a competitive international workforce. Furthermore, results from this award will promote the progress of science by directly advancing the fields of carbohydrate and polymer science, including initiatives highlighted under the National Academy of Sciences report, ""Transforming the Glycosciences: A Roadmap to the Future (2012)"", which specifically emphasizes a broader understanding of the roles of carbohydrate polymers in chemical, biological and industrial processes. Long term, the results from this research may ultimately lead to advancements in national health, prosperity and welfare by providing a better understanding of the fundamental roles carbohydrates play in human health and disease. <br/><br/>One of the major challenges in studying molecular interactions between carbohydrates and other biomolecules is the low binding affinity of individual carbohydrate subunits. Biological systems overcome this issue by increasing localized concentrations of carbohydrate residues or by the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands on proteins, lipids or cell surfaces. Molecular scaffolds, which can be selectively tuned to vary the number and density of sugar ligands along a defined oligomeric backbone, can be used to gain fundamental insights into multivalent carbohydrate interactions and the processes they govern. The research in this proposal, which will be conducted with Davidson College undergraduate participants and in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann and her team at Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, uses a systematic approach to synthesize several precision glycoconjugates to study the relationships between the ways in which carbohydrate ligands are presented (e.g. on a rigid oligoproline scaffold versus a more flexible oligo(amidoamine) scaffold), and how that presentation impacts carbohydrate binding in two classes of carbohydrate binding proteins: galectins and the C-type lectins. The overarching research question that will be addressed by the proposed research is: How does the presentation of carbohydrates on well-defined rigid or flexible scaffolds impact their ability to engage proteins involved in specific recognition events? The outcomes of this research will provide greater insight into factors that govern carbohydrate recognition and may help scientists better understand how recognition events and the corresponding biological outcomes of those events are tuned by carbohydrate display.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing technologies fail to meet the energy storage demand and novel solutions are needed. An attractive technology that can potentially meet the growing demand is solid oxide electrolysis, where electrical energy produced by renewables is converted into chemical energy and stored for later use. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are complex, integrated material systems that use electrical energy as input to catalyze chemical reactions that produce chemical fuels. However, at present SOECs last for only a few hundreds of hours primarily because of degradation and failure at interfaces and in the bulk. In this project, an international partnership, comprising the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of California at Berkeley, and Northwestern University in the U.S. and Kyushu University in Japan, has been formed to demonstrate an integrated approach to enabling SOEC technology. This PIRE award uniquely combines the world-class experimental resources and expertise at KU with the complimentary experimental expertise at UCB and NU, and the world-class computational facilities and expertise at Illinois to solve the energy storage grand challenge. This project will have a lasting institutional impact, including long-term synergistic collaborations between U.S. and Japan; extensive research and training for students and early career investigators in cutting-edge interdisciplinary topics in an international collaborative context, and outreach to K-12 teachers, science museums and summer camps. The integrated PIRE project will advance research in a number of disciplinary areas, including materials, physics, chemistry, engineering and computational science, and create a global citizenry to power the future. <br/><br/>This project will develop an integrated computational and experimental approach to design efficient, reliable, low temperature, extended lifetime SOECs. The novel aspects of the proposal are: 1) Computational and experimental design of novel proton and oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes. This effort will involve the design and development of proton conducting oxides with sufficient stability, operating temperature of 600?aC or lower, higher energy efficiencies at acceptable current density and high proton conductivity. 2) Computational and experimental design of novel electrodes focusing on chemistry and microstructure. This effort will involve the design and development of high-activity electrodes based on microstructure optimization and materials activity. In addition, a detailed understanding of new electrodes such as the Ruddlesden-Popper structures and ordered perovskites will be developed. 3) Computational models and experimental validation of degradation modes in SOECs. This will involve the development of a comprehensive understanding of degradation modes at electrolyte/electrode interfaces focusing on relationships between temperature and applied potential to cation segregation, bubble formation, delamination and fracture. The computational effort is strongly tied with the experimental effort and all computational predictions will be validated with experiments. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers will be engaged in a rich US-Japan exchange program and their PIRE research and education experience will prepare them for challenging positions in the global workplace. Outreach activities will focus on K-12 engagement, teacher training, disseminating knowledge via science museums, and summer camps.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering."

The course is being designed to be relevant to American Indians by including culturally rich examples and real-life applications. Possible topics include water and wastewater treatment, Missouri River water quality, organic farming, alternative energy, ethnobotany, honey bee colony collapse disorder, and Type 2 diabetes. These topics are being developed into case studies, the findings of which will be disseminated at faculty workshops and enrollment campaigns. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>American Indian students are underrepresented in all STEM fields. This proposal addresses an opportunity and a need to create an introductory chemistry course sequence at NICC, to be disseminated to other tribal colleges, including nearby Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC).  Science education studies have shown that science courses are made relevant to American Indian students through the inclusion of culturally rich examples. To do this for chemistry, the project team is developing case studies based on community topics, each of which is linked to specific laboratory methods or measurements. The laboratory experiences are modular for use in a variety of courses. This project advances and improves current STEM education practices at tribal colleges by developing a sustainable process that involves community engagement. Students learn how to connect topics of interest to the community to curricular materials by way of a partnership that involves community leaders, college faculty, college students, and community outreach. This facilitates student learning and deepens existing Native American student knowledge and engagement in STEM fields. The resulting materials and practices are applicable to all educators seeking to increase participation of underrepresented STEM groups.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project promotes STEM learning by Native American students, as well as learning about chemistry instruction by studying these students? attitudes toward continued enrollment in chemistry courses.  The process for making deep connections between community-relevant topics and laboratory exercises shows how to connect the mission of community colleges to the sciences in a way that attracts and retains individuals from other underrepresented groups to STEM education - leading to more students pursuing higher education in STEM fields and a more diverse and stronger STEM workforce. The results of the methodology and assessment lead to measurable outcomes that are used to inform others through local outreach, publications in tribal college and science education literature, and presentations"

T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interdisciplinary PIRE project Water and Commerce: Technologies to Enable Environmental Sustainability in Global Markets will perform innovative research and educate young US scientists and engineers in an international context to provide these solutions. Participating U.S. institutions are Duke University, Michigan State University, and North Carolina Central University. Foreign partners include Istanbul Technical University and Gebze Institute of Technology (Turkey), National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University (Singapore), and Centre Europen de Recherche et d'Enseignement des Gosciences de l'Environnement (France). The specific objectives of the Partnership are to: (i) educate students to work within and manage projects executed by international teams; (ii) perform innovative research with foreign collaborators and industrial partners to develop new technologies and methods that enable the sustainability of water resources and to carry out life cycle assessments of various energy/technology mixes, (iii) develop the awareness of global issues and sustainability, and (iv) increase the number and diversity of students entering careers in science and engineering. Research within the project is organized by international research teams that engage industrial partners to address critical elements of energy transport and production including treatment of ballast water, methods for diagnosing and fingerprinting contamination, and advanced technologies for oil-water separations. Life cycle assessments will produce a multi-level analysis of impacts and trade-offs resulting from energy production and transport scenarios and from the technological innovations developed by the PIRE team. This effort addresses fundamental advances in membrane materials design, methods for controlling the dispersion of non-indigenous and potentially invasive species in ballast water, means for decreasing the environmental footprint of the oil industry, recovering oil, and developing a suite of technologies to diagnose and mitigate the chronic and acute impacts of oil exploration and transportation. Our educational program directly addresses the need for a diverse STEM workforce with the capacity for international collaboration and leadership. The Partnership will cement collaborations between academic participants and industrial partners to form a synergistic Industry/University consortium as an integral part of education and research. Collaborations with industrial partners will help reduce technologies to practice and provide students with opportunities for internships. Students will obtain certification in a rigorous plan of study in science, engineering, management, environmental policy, and systems analysis that emphasizes environmental sustainability in commerce viewed from the perspective of materials, energy and transportation. Leveraging highly successful recruitment programs at Duke, MSU and NCCU (86.7% minority enrollment) and closely coordinating research and education activities between all partner institutions will expand opportunities for underrepresented groups of students to participate in multiple university and global learning/research activities with the goal of increasing the number of these students entering into STEM related fields. The project is funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) through the PIRE."

These responsibilities take two forms: participating in governance of the Institute through participation in the IIASA Council and direct interaction with the organization; and facilitating and encouraging U.S. interest in IIASA's activities. The Board on International Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the U.S. Committee for IIASA, chaired by Professor Don Saari of the University of California, Irvine.  IIASA was established in 1972 as a multilateral, non-governmental research institution devoted to interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research.  At IIASA, multidisciplinary, international teams of researchers conduct research on issues related to environmental, technological, and economic aspects of global change, including energy and technology, population, and natural resources. The Institute thus serves as a neutral forum for sustained investigation and discussion of global and international issues. It is located in Laxenburg, Austria, near Vienna.  The intellectual merit of the proposal consists of the work by the U.S. NMO, in collaboration with interested U.S. researchers and Government agencies, to formulate U.S. views regarding IIASA's research, budget, and administration. This helps to insure the integrity of the Institute and guides the IIASA research program in ways that will maintain its quality and its relevance to U.S. research and policy concerns. The NMO works to broaden the impact of the Institute and its work by serving as a liaison to the U.S. science, technology, and policy communities, with the goal of increasing participation in and awareness of IIASA by Americans in academia, government, business, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This includes recruiting for and funding IIASA's Young Scientists Summer Program for advanced graduate students; helping to find suitable candidates for IIASA's job vacancies; serving as the hub of a national network of interested scholars and policymakers; and helping IIASA to find opportunities to participate in national policy debates.  The chairman of the U.S. Committee represents the U.S. NMO at IIASA's Council meetings. The Council is composed of representatives from the 16 NMO's; each NMO country pays an annual membership contribution. The U.S. Council member works with the Director of IIASA, the IIASA Council Program Committee, and the IIASA Science Advisory Committee to guide and strengthen the IIASA research program. The U.S. national committee carries out an annual review of IIASA's research progress, soliciting comments from academic, government, and other experts in the U.S. scientific community."

High-resolution coastal oceanographic models are being developed to increase understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  These efforts are creating a comprehensive understanding of the effects of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems, and assisting in the development of potential climate change mitigation strategies.  <br/> <br/>The project is increasing the intellectual involvement of Virgin Islanders with coral reef ecosystems and the stewardship of natural resources.  The Virgin Islands Institute for STEM Education Research and Practice uses five strategies to understand and develop best practices for formal and informal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the Territory.  <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The research will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and its resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states (i.e., ecological resilience).  Understanding these complex relationships is of paramount importance, especially considering that within the last decade corals in the U.S.  Virgin Islands have experienced nearly 50% mortality due to climate-induced stress from warm-water bleaching and disease.  Reef degradation increases the risk of coastal flooding, reduces fishery resources for local communities, is linked to reduced human health, and represents a tremendous loss of yet-undiscovered biological diversity.  Studies integrate ecological, oceanographic, environmental, and socio-economic factors to investigate the complex relationships found within coral reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>The U.S. Virgin Islands' ability to enhance environmental stewardship and implement economic change relies on an informed public, trained workforce and improved educational system.  Specific broader impacts include an increase in 1) the numbers of K-12 through graduate students in STEM research activities and educational advancement; 2) underrepresented minorities in STEM fields; 3) opportunities to improve STEM teaching at all levels; and 4) the knowledge of and participation in coral reef science by the general public and students of all levels."

Scientifically, the research project will advance the engineering of biological macromolecules (DNA and proteins) for formation of materials with their structures controlled on the nanometer length scale. The team leader will recruit participants from groups commonly underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines including minority and female students. This international research training experience will provide participants with unique opportunities to enlarge their scientific networks and to experience first-hand the benefits of cultural mixing. The project is important and deserves NSF funding, because it will develop molecular tools as well as scientific personnel capable of advancing nanoscience goals critical to the electronics and medical fields. US participants will benefit from significant scientific and social interactions with foreign students and faculty on-site in Denmark. The project will produce significant outcomes including cutting-edge research results and impactful research training experiences for participating American students. The senior investigators involved have received funding through the Danish National Research Foundation which primarily funds Danish students both in Denmark and on visits to the NCSU lab. IRES funding complements the Danish investment by allowing US students to participate in research at Aarhus.<br/><br/> The project's scientific focus will be on the development of self-assembling DNA nanostructures and on their application toward nanofabrication of electronic, photonic, and biomedical devices. The NCSU team has used DNA as a building material to implement molecular computers, and to organize proteins and metallic nanoparticles with molecular-scale precision, while the Aarhus team is expert in DNA-guided chemistry for programmed synthesis of very large organic molecules. Developing ways to control matter on the nanoscale by exploiting the same construction principles used by biology (i.e. molecular recognition) holds great promise for diverse nanofabrication and biomedical applications. Engineered supramolecular complexes comprised of DNA, polypeptides, and inorganic nanomaterials provide the right length scale, range of physicochemical interactions, and complexity of shapes for interfacing effectively with biological structures. As such, DNA nanotechnology represents a perfect approach for creating custom diagnostic and ?smart? therapeutic agents for medical applications. Likewise, these same principles and materials are ideal for developing bionanofabrication procedures to compete with lithography for generation of electronic devices and circuits. Pursuit of biomimetic materials science, including molecular engineering for bottom-up assembly of complex nanostructures with diverse chemical, biological, photonic, or electronic functions, requires highly interdisciplinary teams. This cross-disciplinary work will therefore provide opportunities for very broad-based educational experiences to the participants. The cross-pollination provided by IRES funded international travel will lead to molecular materials engineering advances which could impact many fields of science and technology through applications in low-power nanoelectronics, programmable nanochemistry, novel biosensors, and smart therapeutics for biomedicine."

However, any computer is only as good as the materials it is built from: for instance, the success of our present day computers is due to the remarkable properties of silicon which can be crafted into processors. This PIRE will establish a multidisciplinary partnership between universities, research centers and corporations in the U.S. and France, led by the University of Pittsburgh. The aim of the partnership is the discovery and investigation of materials that hold exceptional promise for fundamental quantum physics and quantum device engineering. In particular, the focus will be on hybrid materials which combine disparate materials kinds, such as semiconductors and superconductors, in a single structure. Hybrid materials are as diverse as nanowires and atom-thick sheets, with atomically sharp interfaces between one material and the other. This PIRE program will bring together materials engineers, surface scientists, computational chemists, and experimental and theoretical physicists. The approach will extend from crystal growth to fabrication and testing of quantum devices based on newly synthesized materials, guided and aided by theoretical and computational studies. U.S. and French students will receive quantum technology training in the multicultural and multidisciplinary environment of the project.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Due to the inherent fragility of quantum information, the materials requirements for quantum computers are more stringent than for classical computers. Furthermore, new physical phenomena may need to be discovered and mastered before a practical quantum computer can be built. The primary research goal of this PIRE is the discovery of new hybrid materials and the search for emergent phenomena that can only be realized at hybrid interfaces. Hybrid materials are those which combine layers of dissimilar material classes, such as superconductors and semiconductors. This partnership will focus on a diverse universe of hybrid materials including nanowires, van der Waals heterostructures and two-dimensional epitaxial interfaces. The approach will extend from in-situ observation of crystal growth to low temperature measurements of quantum devices based on these materials, guided by first-principles and mesoscopic theory studies. Two-dimensional materials will be primarily pursued in the U.S., while one-dimensional materials will be the focus in France. Scalability of quantum architectures comprising thousands of quantum bits demands a precise understanding of and control over the materials that will comprise quantum circuits. Interfacing superconductors with semiconductors may pave the way to realizing such large-scale quantum circuits by combining the virtues of both, namely the electrical tunability of semiconductors with the long coherence times observed in superconductors. Superconductor/semiconductor interfaces are also the basis for proposed fault tolerant qubits encoded in topologically protected quantum states immune to local noise. Undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs from U.S. will perform research visits to France and participate in international research projects that will take advantage of unique research infrastructure and a well-established International Internship Program in Grenoble. Laboratories in the US will welcome French students for reciprocal visits. Summer schools and online courses on the frontier subjects in materials science and quantum computing will be organized for the junior researchers in the program."

Immediate applications of this research field include artificial intellegence and national security (including cyber-security), interactive robotics, improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children and elderly.<br/>This project will place students from the University of Central Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke, the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany for each year of the grant period.<br/>This research project is motivated by an ancient art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent, the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person. This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. <br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Storytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books. Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner, the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information."

However, the inclusion of large quantities of additional elements typically causes alloys to become brittle. Recent work, including that by American undergraduate students working with researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia and Prof. Lori Bassman of Harvey Mudd College (HMC), has led to the development of novel metal alloys using a new strategy. These advanced alloys, called high entropy alloys (HEAs), have carefully selected compositions with approximately equal amounts of several elements and have demonstrated excellent material properties. This project will greatly expand the range of combinations of elements that can be used to create successful HEAs. With the proposed new strategy will come increased promise for creating alloys with improved combinations of strength, ductility and cost. During ten week periods in the summers of 2017 to 2019, twelve undergraduate students will conduct experimental and computational research at UNSW towards this goal. The lead collaborators, Dr. Kevin Laws and Prof. Michael Ferry in the UNSW School of Materials Science and Engineering, and researchers in the UNSW Electron Microscope Unit have worked with HMC undergraduates for many years. They will continue to provide students with discipline-specific expertise and mentoring unavailable at HMC as well as extensive access to physical metallurgy laboratories, microscope facilities and training.<br/><br/>Progress in the HEA field so far has focused on identification of specific systems of elements that can form one or two simple solid solution phases with high thermal stability and no brittle intermetallic phases. In this project new HEAs will be developed by increasing the ductility of intermetallic phases that occur in other systems. Through this alloy development, the students and their UNSW mentors will refine the fundamental principles that govern HEA formation and atomic ordering and explore the deformation mechanisms associated with greatly enhanced strength and ductility in HEAs over conventional alloys. The specific experimental projects to be performed by HMC undergraduates include alloy design, alloy fabrication, mechanical characterization and microstructural characterization. Computational projects will involve first-principles modeling of alloy structures and properties. These experiences will contribute to the maturation of the students into confident, enthusiastic researchers who are prepared for science and engineering careers in international research environments. At least half of the participating students will be female, and underrepresented minority students will be specifically recruited. <br/><br/>This research is funded by the IRES program of the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering."

Wasserman & Peter A. Beck, Environmental Science & Policy, St. Edward's University<br/><br/><br/>Non-technical Project Description<br/><br/>Biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution are major threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life, especially for societies that directly depend upon the local environment for resources.  Addressing human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems. These ecosystems contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate change mitigation through carbon storage, and filter pollutants from water and air.  However, traditional conservation strategies that exclude local populations have often been ineffective leading to significant forest loss over the past several decades.  This NSF IRES research program will evaluate the effectiveness of alternative conservation strategies to maintain tropical forest ecosystems and primate populations, while also maintaining the livelihoods of local communities surrounding the forests.  Through this research program, underrepresented students in the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience.  The investigators will integrate ecological and social research methods to address questions critical to fields of ecology, anthropology, and environmental policy, address current environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, and provide STEM training for underrepresented students at two biological field stations in Costa Rica (La Selva and Las Cruces) in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies.  Students will work closely with Costa Rican field assistants and local communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange.  Interested Costa Rican university students will be included in the projects and encouraged to apply for the master's program in environmental management and sustainability at St. Edward's University.  At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and Costa Rican scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences.  An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure to a developing country.  Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods, particularly in tropical forest regions.  <br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities.  Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation.  Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.  Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks.  However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached in developing countries, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas.  As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives.  Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations.  Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1. To quantify how policies integrating conservation and development objectives, such as ecotourism, academic research activities, and multiple-use protected areas, influence tropical forests and their primates, as well as how effective these environmental policies are at maintaining human livelihoods.  2. To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in the environmental sciences.  To meet these objectives, student projects will examine differences in forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, carbon storage, diversity) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, population size) across a number of forests at and surrounding Las Cruces and La Selva Biological Stations in Costa Rica that are protected for various objectives (i.e., ecotourism, research, national conservation).  Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how this influences local perception of environmental policy.  Specifically, 15 ten-week independent master's student research projects will occur across a three-year period to survey primate populations, quantify behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays in country (an environmental endocrinology laboratory will be established in Costa Rica), conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, other stakeholders, and tourists, and quantify forest characteristics.  By examining interactions between people, parks, and primates through independent, yet interrelated, student projects, we will be able to provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of private ecotourism, public protected areas, and academic research stations to maintain livelihoods for human populations and promote conservation of biodiversity.  Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic, participatory, and research incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes.  As a breakdown in either natural ecosystems or human society will negatively affect the other, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain both biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually promoting sustainability and conservation."

Examples of such materials include nuclear waste, biological contagions for which there is no cure (like the Ebola virus), and even return samples from outer space that may harbor unknown compounds or life forms. The chance of contamination of the general public by any of these materials is extremely small, however, there are professionals that are exposed to these types of dangers on a regular basis. Since these professionals must handle these materials, it is paramount not only for their safety, but for the safety of the general public, to take extreme measures to ensure that any and all possible mistakes are minimized and contained. <br/><br/>This workshop explores current practices and difficulties of handling these types of materials with the goal of learning common methods and practices that cut across all such materials. This is referred to as the ""science of safety"" and it promises to benefit national priorities by making dangerous materials safer and more productive, by protecting citizens, healthcare workers, emergency responders, and researchers from accidental exposure, and by promoting business by streamlining procedures and improving work environments. The workshop will bring together 20 experts in US and 10 experts from Japan, France, Korea, Sweden, UK, Spain, and Italy. International collaboration will be expanded through this project via lessons learned from our international partners. International participation is particularly important because the unique nature and infrequent occurrence of exposure events make it desirable to gather the most pertinent experiences from around the world.

We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Expert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westflische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Blmich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media."

With an increasing number of aging structures in the United States, there is a growing need for workforce development to address the potential for historic preservation in coming years.  The goal of this project is to develop a cadre of experts with specialized training and global awareness in the engineering aspects of historical preservation projects.  To address this need, Dr. Erdogmus from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will collaborate with the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) of Turkey.  This 3-year program will bring a group of nine US students to Turkey for a seven-week summer research in historic preservation engineering.  It is the intention of the PI to recruit at least 50% of the cohort each year from underrepresented groups.  The Turkish mentors from IZTECH are Dr. Mine Turan and Dr. Engin Aktas, representing the Architectural Restoration and Civil Engineering Departments, respectively.  Under the experienced leadership of the hosts and the PI, the US students participating in the program will be provided with meaningful and comprehensive research experiences comprised of lab-work at IZTECH campus and a variety of field-applications that involve historical sites. <br/><br/>This three year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will involve American graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the interface of structural engineering and conservation with three focus themes: 1) Engineering- conservation coordination for assessment of historical structures and materials prior to an intervention, 2) Engineering- conservation coordination for the development of compatible materials for historical retrofits, and 3) Post-Intervention assessment and risk analysis for the collapse-safety of structures. Under each of these focus themes, the IRES students will conduct specific projects and tasks; namely, the students will: a) Develop a novel method to provide a closed feedback loop on complex sites, which involves a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) based rating system for each element correlating the visual assessments to its interior damage levels.  This will then inform variant constitutive models and aid in the design for the conservation intervention. b) Investigate chemical and mechanical properties of modern cements from different locations in order to evaluate their behavior under extreme heat, salt water, and freeze-thaw cycles when paired with different historical stones. c) Develop a decision making algorithm for historical structures using probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses to identify safety concerns and to predict design event recurrence intervals for which a given structure remains safe. This algorithm will then support decisions for or against intervention, ensuring only a minimum level of invasive intervention applied to the historic site.

These reefs are an extremely important biological and economic resource locally and globally, but are severely threatened by human impacts and climate change; as such, these reefs are important conservation targets. We will be deploying a novel monitoring tool called Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to measure marine biodiversity gradients across the Indonesian Archipelago and determine what organisms are present on these reefs and how this biodiversity is impacted by human caused environmental stress. ARMS are particularly good at capturing the hidden biodiversity that comprises the vast majority of marine biodiversity (e.g., viruses, microbes, smaller animals, algae etc). With this information, we will be able to better understand the processes shaping the marine biodiversity in the Coral Triangle, thereby improving the ability of resource managers to develop strategies to promote sustainability of these valuable marine ecosystems. A key innovation of this project is that it will be conducted in an international collaborative framework that  increases local scientific capacity in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous developing countries, while simultaneously preparing U.S. post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students to be global leaders in the science of marine biodiversity, capable of international research in the world's most diverse marine environments.

Currently only 20-23% of the population in Africa has access to electricity.  Large percentage of the population lives far from urban centers.  Only portable energy sources will be able to meet, at least partially, the energy needs of rural populations.  A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in this program will engage in research on a novel concept of renewable energy harvesting.  They will develop working modules that will be tested in the field with the aim of producing efficient portable energy sources to improve the lives of people living in rural Africa.  In addition, the cultural experience gained through interactions with the tribal communities in Africa, and the knowledge gained on the way of life in each tribe, their societal rules and norms, and the struggles they face in day-to-day life, will transform their view of the world.  Their efforts will be highly rewarding, as they will be contributing to increase the renewable and portable power generation in these remote areas that will greatly improve the quality of life for the segment of the world population that is lagging behind the norms. <br/>To implement the project the PI at the University of South Florida (USF) will collaborate with the researchers at the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST).  After completing a 3-week research program at USF, students will travel to Botswana and will team up with a cohort of students at BIUST for a 5-week period where they will learn, live, work, and travel together. <br/><br/>The primary goal of research is to study the feasibility of combining thermoelectric modules and solar devices to generate much higher electrical power than what is possible with individual devices.  Thermoelectric modules formed with materials of high Seebeck coefficient can produce high voltages but low conductivity that leads to low currents.  Typical solar cell open-circuit voltages are relatively low, but high absorption of radiation can generate high density of carriers.  However, high carrier recombination losses lead to low short circuit current.  This project will investigate a novel paradigm in which the relatively high voltage (1-4 V) produced by the thermoelectric modules from the recovery of waste heat of cooking stoves used in rural Africa will be used to reverse-bias the solar cell for generating a high photo-generated current.  The combination of the high voltage, high current, combined with a suitable circuit design, has the potential to enhance power generation and more efficient charging of batteries or capacitors.  The outcome will be educating a cohort of graduate and undereducated students on energy challenges of the rural communities in the world, and developing innovative concepts based on fundamental science to resolve issues of the global society. Though the initial effort is to develop a power source for rural Africa, the concept can be extended to multitude of commercial products and military applications where power can be generated when plugging into the power grid is not an option.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

QUIST endeavors to exploit the weirdness of elementary particle physics with the ultimate objectives of deploying a Quantum Internet, designing secure communication systems that cannot be compromised by eavesdropping, and providing national security agencies with quantum computers able to crack encryption with unprecedented speed. At a more fundamental level, QUIST underpins innovative developments across a significant range of disciplines including mathematics, computer science, physics, control engineering, semiconductor device technology, and medicine. This program will be run jointly with British scientists and students from Cardiff University and Swansea University, in Wales, UK, capitalizing on Wales' unique position in quantum devices based on compound semiconductor technologies. A cohort of five US students are sent to the United Kingdom, where they are offered a unique combination of hands-on research training, courses and workshops on scientific and complementary transferable skills, and they interact with a cohort of British students, strengthening the unique US-UK bond in sensitive technology and national security. <br/><br/>In this program, the PI-team focuses on high fidelity control of spintronic networks that transmit information by spin wave rather than charged particle transport. Controller design will be based on optimization of fidelity relative to static bias fields. One of the unique pitches of this research is to bring the concept of robustness in the quantum control arena, specifically, robustness against spin coupling uncertainty and bias field focusing errors. This in itself is already a transformative research, as robustness in quantum systems escapes the classical paradigms because of the unique, and fundamentally quantum mechanical, global phase factor that has no classical counterpart. This yields such amazing results that the best fidelity controllers are also the most robust, in defiance of the classical limitations. This would allow, among other things, control to shed light on such physics research topics as Anderson localization, Multi Body Localization (MBL) and Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The next innovative feature is the introduction of decoherence, which was shown but not yet theoretically proved to make robustness classical, consistently with the very speculative concept that decoherence makes physics classical. The last and probably most innovative pitch of the research will be to approach spintronics from the networking angle, first for the objective of constructing quantum network-on-chip, but also for the reason that many students opt for a networking educational track and that quite a lot of young talent can be tapped from this pool.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at Estacin de Biologa, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from Mxico and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations. This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community. <br/><br/>The Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance, SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF."

Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases, it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities, and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.  Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught. This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18 highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. <br/><br/>Today?s global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education, but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition, the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for others to seek out international research opportunities."

This IRES will provide at least 18 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with unique hands-on experience and significant knowledge of cutting-edge NF fabrication methods, as well as NF testing and application by providing an intense research program at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in catalysis and bio-fuels in Poland. Students will develop practical skills needed to address the knowledge gaps in NF science and technology, bring their experiences back to their home institutions, and help to develop a global-capable workforce for this emerging market. By using a cohesive approach and drawing on complementary expertise, facilities and traditions across the nations and regions, will enhance the intellectual as well as the societal and economic returns of this IRES program.<br/><br/>This program will provide 18 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a unique opportunity to carry out 8 week of cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofiber science, technology, and biomedical and energy applications at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis, Poland.  Nanofibers (NF) form a large class of materials that can exhibit nano-enabled unique properties, which are unattainable at a larger scale.  However, the growth potential of the NF materials market is still hindered by the limited ability to efficiently generate sizeable quantities of nanofibers with predictable and controllable complex, macroscopic architectures and desirable properties.  Students will work at TUL with a new, high-rate, alternating-current electrospinning (ac-electrospinning) process that unveils several new physical phenomena which help to overcome major disadvantages of commonly used dc-electrospinning, such as ?whipping? instability and residual electric charge, while increasing the process productivity by 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude. Students will explore selected NF-based materials for advanced catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions at UT-Lodz, along with other applications tested at TUL.  During the pre-trip training, foreign site work, and post-trip activities, students will focus on advancing basic understanding of all aspects of emerging high-rate ac-electrospinning, in order to direct the assembly of NF into desired configurations and to stimulate the development of commercializable processes for nanofiber-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis, biomedical uses, and other potential applications.  Overall, this program shall facilitate a broader long-term collaboration between the US and international research groups within the nanofiber research and manufacturing domain by bringing new collaborators and facilitating multiple international links between the researchers and students in related areas."

The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).<br/><br/>The unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To better understand the impacts of dam-building, research is needed to integrate direct environmental effects, indirect effects of how dams change the ways people interact with their environment, and the interactions between these two effects. With its first large dam under construction and another planned, Mongolia's Selenge River watershed represents an excellent study site for such an investigation.  It is also a compelling site because Northern Mongolia's shifting precipitation patterns and rising air temperatures (which have warmed three times faster than the global average), have made traditional herding a more difficult and economically risky livelihood.  Some herders have responded by intensifying their use of other natural resources, including fish.  By combining research methods from the social and environmental sciences, and by using high-technology tools as well as field work, 18 U.S. students, working with scientists/mentors from several U.S. institutions and from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, will develop an integrated set of approaches for examining social and ecological dynamics of hydroelectric development.  This project will also give U.S. students hands-on experience in working across cultures and in a team-based approach to large complex projects.<br/><br/>This IRES project enables students to use multiple approaches to evaluate the impact of dams on the Selenge River's human and natural systems. Among the projects they will undertake are: 1) surveying for critically endangered fish species using analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) shed by fish in the water; 2) estimating the abundance of Taimen, the world's largest salmonid, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) as a rapid and unobtrusive visual survey platform; 3) conducting swimming performance trials to forecast fishes' ability to utilize fish ladders designed to mitigate dam impacts; 4) interviewing community elders to gauge rates of community change in the past and since dam construction started;  5) interviewing young villagers to understand how dam-building and other factors influence their desire to leave their villages for urban area; and 6) assessing the impacts of possible dam-caused fish declines on foreign sport fisherman (who bring valuable foreign currency to the region) and on Mongolians who increasingly depend on fish for food."

In line with NSF's mission, this project will lead to a deeper understanding of how small, prebiotic molecules interact with surfaces and participate in the emergence of biologically applicable precursors. On a fundamental level, this project will study how amino acid molecules interact and how those interactions correlate to biologically relevant structures like proteins. Importantly, the association of single-molecule studies performed on a high-end microscope (low temperature, high vacuum) with studies performed on a less-ideal microscope (room temperature, typical atmospheric pressure) is both novel and essential to studying biologically relevant systems. While single molecule studies are often performed in pristine conditions, it is rare that those studies are combined with the same systems in the real-world.  Research outcomes will make significant contributions to our understanding of prebiotic molecules and the evolution of those molecules on metallic surfaces. The findings of this research will be used at educational events to demonstrate how fundamental science can be used to make broader predictions about amino acids and the beginning of biologically-active molecules on this planet. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/> The preference for a specific handedness of biological molecules has long intrigued scientists. The question of how chiral symmetry was broken and subsequently biased towards left-handed molecules is central to the understanding of the origin of life on this planet. As a step towards understanding such processes, the assembly of individual molecules on surfaces can be studied with modern surface science techniques. Low-temperature, ultra-high vacuum, scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-UHV STM) will be used to capture exact molecular arrangements, which will then be coupled with liquid and electrochemical STM (EC-STM) to replicate biological conditions for model systems such as amino acids on metals. In addition to imaging molecular self-assembly with nanoscale resolution, STM images will be used to understand chiral propagation and recognition, which is directly applicable to origin of life studies. Beyond the transfer of chirality, these biological systems are relevant for the study of the preference for secondary structures by different amino acid residues. In order to study these systems, several research objectives are proposed: (1) Establish a baseline for molecular assembly and how molecular adsorption alters the underlying metal substrate in UHV. (2) Use ambient, liquid, and EC-STM to determine if the observed UHV behavior can be extended to more realistic conditions. (3) Investigate how the chirality of L-amino acids is transmitted across a 2D surface in UHV.  This proposal addresses the critical need to ascertain a connection between model chiral surface studies and studies performed with similar resolution under relevant biochemical conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project takes advantage of the instrumentation, computing capabilities, and theoretical expertise at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to develop a theoretical framework that will improve our understanding of these forces. When this goal is achieved, it will be possible to predict reactions that take place under extreme conditions, from stellar explosions to the interior of nuclear reactors. Improving our knowledge of nuclear reactions will help us further understand 'nuclei-fueled' astrophysical processes, and safely and economically harness nuclear phenomena in support of the broad scope of humanitarian needs. Future advances in nuclear science and technology hold promise for a growing number of applications for medicine, industry, energy, and national security. The development of advanced instrumentation and applications of nuclear isotopes in disease treatments provide two prominent examples that rely on elementary properties of atomic nuclei. In addition to providing access to the facilities and expertise at LLNL, this project will provide training and unique research experiences for the PI and a postdoctoral fellow, with indirect benefits to graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project aims to dramatically expand the reach as well as the impact of nuclear reaction theory with the aim of predicting properties of experimentally inaccessible nuclei and reactions, while supporting and informing experiments at current and upcoming radioactive beam facilities.  The goal is to develop and implement a symmetry-guided theory that will enable pioneering ab initio investigations of reactions for heavier nuclear species, while accounting for the challenging structure of the participating nuclei. This will be achieved by capitalizing on approximate symmetries known to dominate in nuclei. In this approach all participating particles in the target and incoming proton or neutron are treated on the same footing within a 'shell model' concept of the quantum many-particle system and the compound nucleus. In addition, state-of-the-art chiral effective field theory interactions between protons and neutrons will be employed. New predictions, possible through the unique combination of expertise of theoretical and experimental nuclear physicists at Louisiana State University and LLNL are anticipated for processes inaccessible to experiments, which can facilitate neutrino- and fusion-related research and are key to advancing knowledge about astrophysical processes, as well as of fundamental symmetries in nature. This, in turn, can help address two of the most fundamental questions of physics today: the origin of elements, and if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. While the proposed applications focus on specific important questions, the new developments will have wider impact, as multi-physics simulations in the areas of nuclear energy and national security have similar needs. As part of this research, future leaders will be trained in research in low-energy nuclear science, while learning and working in massively parallel environments at petascale computing facilities."

LiFE collaborators will address this problem at its source: the early learning experiences of elementary school girls. The elementary-middle school period is critical because by 8th grade, many girls have left the STEM pathway forever. The key to reversing the trend is finding effective ways to showcase STEM as a collaborative, people-rich space in which girls can participate together, be themselves, and engage in exploration. Research indicates that girls prefer collaborative activities that can make a difference in the world. Partnering with a coalition of economically and racially diverse New Jersey elementary schools, LiFE will employ ""iSTEAM"" learning strategies that encourage girls to apply the tools of various disciplines to investigate and solve real-world problems in an open environment of innovation, collaboration, and communication. This approach promises to be especially effective in engaging girls.<br/><br/>LiFE will build on a successful Girls Science Club (GSC) model that introduces girls in grades 3-4 to hands-on iSTEAM exploration activities using Problem/Project-Based Learning strategies. Additional activities will leverage the expertise of the project's corporate/government partners (including Apple and USARMY) to build communication and leadership skills. LiFE will sustain the GSC's benefits by developing clubs for grades 5-6 involving enriched content and long-term independent projects. Eventually, a tiered peer network will link girls from elementary school through women college students and female STEM professionals--each tier mentoring the tiers below. This network will sustain a crucial ""sense of community"" to retain women in STEM.  Within LiFE's social innovation framework approach, participating districts will tailor the GSC to their community while also working together toward shared common goals. LiFE will study the impact of GSCs on persistence of girls' interest in STEM into grade 7. Based on this research, LiFE will develop a cost-effective template that can be replicated across the US. LiFE will bring problem-based iSTEAM concepts to girls of all academic levels in their elementary schools years while, having a community focus with participant-developed projects in a non-competitive environment and leveraging the resources of academic, corporate and government partners to foster broader participation by women in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These exosuits will integrate electro-mechanical actuation (motor-tendons) with the functional electrical stimulation (FES) of muscles to provide ease of movement by assistance and rehabilitation. This research will advance the University of Alabama's (UA) rehabilitation research through the development of design methodologies for motor-tendon driven soft exosuits by adapting principles from fields of compliant mechanisms and composite materials for soft structures. The resulting multi-layer soft material composite exosuits, with reinforced fibers, will address stress concentration and distribution problems specific to electromechanical actuators. This will include addressing anchor-point stress concentration and efficient transfer of actuator forces between components. Nonlinear controllers will be developed to integrate electromechanical and neuromuscular actuation in soft exosuits to effect ease of movement.

Examples include materials production; the formation, destruction, and remediation of contaminants; cloud formation; and host-pathogen interactions. Explaining the nature and processes occurring on surfaces is necessary to control, modify, and use them to achieve further scientific knowledge and economic advantage. One environmental issue that depends on surface interactions is the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs). EPFRs are present in significant amount in atmospheric particles, forming when byproducts emitted from the burning of waste and fuels interact with metal-containing nanoparticles. Unlike previously identified atmospheric free radicals, which exist for only a fraction of a second, EPFRs can persist for several months, allowing them to be transported over a wider area from their source. Health risks associated with inhaled particles that contain EPFRs include a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions as well as an increased susceptibility to infection. These concerns, in conjunction with the trends and predicted impact of nanotechnology in the coming years, present an urgent need to address and fill the critical knowledge gaps about EPFR formation. Understanding the structure and nature of EPFRs is a key step towards improving strategies to mitigate their adverse health impacts, which will enhance public health and quality of life. Access to instrumentation available at National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHFML; located at  Florida State University) will allow detailed characterization of EPFRs, enabling a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which they interact with other chemcials and potentially impact human health. This collaboration with scientists at NHMFL is important to the PI's current and future research at the University of South Carolina at Coumbia. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Elucidating the physical and chemical interactions occurring on surfaces of nanoparticles will provide wider avenues of research about aerosol science, chemistry, and catalysis that will be key to collaboratively addressing critical environmental and human health questions. The overarching theme of this research is to understand the various ways these surface processes impact society, including the formation of persistent contaminants catalyzed by manufactured nanoparticles, the interaction of nanoparticles with volatile contaminants, the synthesis of nanocatalysts for environmental remediation and energy production, and the development of specialized nanoparticles for mitigating influenza infection. The facilities at the NHMFL will provide an excellent research environment for this fellowship. NHMFL is equipped with state-of-the-science equipment for characterizing and analyzing nanoscale surfaces and for determining complex chemical structures.  Using a combination of advanced electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques available at the NHMFL, the research goals are to identify the molecular structures of surface-bound organic EPFRs and elucidate the mechanisms of EPFRs. The fellowship's goals will not only address an existing critical need, that is, to investigate the environmental and human health risks associated with EPFRs, but also enhance the PI's capabilities for other current and future projects."

Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. <br/><br/>A range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy.

Several students each year will undertake projects designed to acquire new and useful information about the carnivores inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, and to develop strong, long-lasting professional relationships with Kenyan scientists. A strong team of American and Kenyan trainers will help students address a broad array of research questions about the behavior, conservation and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to the effects of human activity on their stress physiology. Pairs of undergraduate and graduate students will be linked by topical research focus, and work closely with local experts. While in Kenya, students will receive explicit training in science writing, and present their work at an annual conference on carnivore biology sponsored by the Kenya Wildlife Service. The research opportunities offered to students here are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain very poorly understood, but also to make important contributions to behavioral ecology, stress physiology and conservation biology. The knowledge acquired in this research should facilitate conservation of African carnivores, and thus contribute to the economic well-being of Kenya, which is intimately linked with revenues from eco-tourism. This research program will also contribute significantly to the professional development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The intellectual focus of this project is the behavioral ecology, physiology, and conservation of African carnivores.  Mammalian carnivores are critical to the stability and integrity of ecosystems around the world, largely because they play key roles in regulating such important ecosystem processes as interspecific competition and predator-prey dynamics.  Despite their importance, however, carnivores are in global decline due to a combination of habitat degradation and direct human persecution. In fact, today many carnivore populations are declining even within protected areas. It has become clear in recent years that our ability to conserve mammalian carnivores, including most of those in Africa, is limited by a dearth of knowledge about many aspects of their basic biology. This international research training program aims to fill these gaps in our knowledge in regard to African carnivores, and to apply that new knowledge to improving carnivore management; this program should thus ultimately facilitate carnivore conservation across the African continent. During the proposed funding period, students will use experimental and observational methods to test hypotheses suggesting 1) relationships among social complexity, foraging demands and general intelligence, 2) endocrine substrates of cooperative behavior, 3) how anthropogenic activities affect the behavior, physiology and demography of mammalian carnivores, and 4) best carnivore management practices. This is the only training program in the United States where both undergraduate and graduate students can obtain field research experience investigating the biology of free-living African carnivores. Most past participants in this program have reported their experiences in Kenya to be life-changing, setting them on trajectories of professional development they otherwise never would have dreamed possible."

These ACTs will generate fundamental scientific understanding that enables the design of novel materials and properties for the robust collection and purification of water, elimination/reduction of disease transmission, and efficient generation and storage of energy, and hence, will address societal needs that have high relevance for the world and the U.S. To this aim, the University of Pennsylvania has formed an international partnership with fourteen collaborators from six institutions within the Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies (GIANT) in Grenoble, France. The collaboration with Giant provides the complementary expertise and resources critical for the research. The domestic partners, namely, Alabama State University, Villanova University and Bryn Mawr College further increase the research depth and diversity of participants, who will take part in every aspect of the project including research and education at GIANT. Through the planned research programs every summer, the US team consisting of a post doc, an early career faculty, and graduate and undergraduate students from these domestic institutions and UPenn, will gain invaluable international research experiences at Grenoble.  Other important educational components include industrial internships at Salvoy, a world leader in the area, as well as workshops to develop broader career skills, training for the communication of technical information, and the opportunity to innovate on a prototype ""Relief Tent"" that will showcase ACT research.  The research will address fundamental and up-to-now unsolved, materials-related scientific problems that will be applicable to engineering better human habitats and emergency response structures.  The integrated research and educational components of the project will contribute to preparing a globally-engaged science and engineering workforce and a new cadre of US scientists poised to be international scientific leaders.<br/><br/>Part 2:<br/>To enable coatings that transform the human habitat, each ACT utilizes the versatility afforded by polymers, nanoparticles and their mixtures to create coatings with tailored chemistry, surface texture and function.  ACT 1 (water management) seeks to understand how the size, geometry, and surface energy of hierarchically structured coatings influence wetting and water transport.  GIANT adds expertise in photoreactive nanomaterials that, when combined with Penn's structured coatings, open new opportunities to manage water. US scientists can investigate wetting of structured coatings using micro beam x-ray scattering tools at GIANT. ACT 2 (suppression of disease transmission) will relate the mechanics and texture of nanobilayer and layer-by-layer coatings to bacteria adhesion and proliferation. GIANT's expertise in synthesis and visualization of biomacromolecules is critical for understanding how bacteria interact with novel surfaces.  ACT 3 (energy conversion and storage) will design multilayered coatings to efficiently collect and convert light using textured surfaces from ACT 1 in combination with unique nanoparticles.  These photovoltaic cells will be coupled with solid polymer electrolytes designed with fast ion pathways for next generation lithium ion batteries. GIANT's expertise in interrogating energy materials in-situ and in-operando is particularly unique.  Five unifying principles and methods integrate the ACTs, including commonality of materials and approaches, the unifying role of theory and simulation, a need for mechanical characterization and robustness, novel methods for structure/property studies at GIANT, and the translation of basic research into applications in collaboration with industry."

Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled ""Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris"" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.<br/><br/>Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French ""Grandes Ecoles"", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The result of this increased activity will be intensified urban development in extreme conditions. The purpose of this project is to promote greater urban sustainability in the Arctic so that the ultimate human impact on the larger environment will be as small as possible. To achieve such a broad international goal, this Partnership for International Research and Education (PIRE) will bring together scientists from the U.S., Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Norway and Russia. Developing strong cooperation among the various Arctic countries, as well as other European and Asian countries with growing interests in the north, is necessary to ensure that future development in this polar region is managed effectively. With the U.S. chairing the Arctic Council from May 2015 to May 2017, this PIRE will improve the ability of policy-makers to promote sustainability by providing tools to measure progress, identify areas of most urgent need, select verifiable best practices, examine opportunity costs, and determine where external actors can have the greatest impact.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will develop an Arctic Urban Sustainability Index, which will make it possible to assess the consequences of human activities in the region across a number of important dimensions. The Index will be used to measure sustainability outcomes and progress toward achieving those outcomes in a wide variety of Arctic cities. Key elements of the index will include thawing permafrost, a boom-bust economic cycle, and an influx of migrant workers with the resulting increase in social tensions. Our central hypothesis posits that: Measuring sustainability efforts across the full range of scale and mechanisms and compiling the results in the form of an index will trigger efforts to improve urban planning. The project will be multi-disciplinary in nature, incorporating the analytical tools of geography, climatology, architecture, design, sociology, and political science.  Importantly, the Index will not be limited to use in the Arctic. It could be effective in measuring sustainability in other extreme climate conditions, such as in the new cities rising in the Persian Gulf and in places like Phoenix, Arizona."

Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved, providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds will document the project to share the overall experience of international research with a broad audience through public outreach programs. <br/><br/>Through this 3-year project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of volcano anatomy. In the Jin Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise (esk rj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100 m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation, and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as: 1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry, exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

Plant DNA viruses have emerged as leading pathogens that threaten crops worldwide. These studies will focus on Cassava mosaic disease, which is endemic to Africa and severely limits the production of cassava, a major food crop across the continent.  Because Africa is one of the fastest growing regions in the world, with a population projected to double to 2.4 billion people by 2050, producing sufficient quantities of high quality, nutritious food is a challenge there. Agriculture is increasingly a global enterprise and finding solutions to food security problems will depend on research partnerships such as this one that explores the basic science of how plant DNA viruses evolve and what limits their ability to adapt over time. Such fundamental knowledge can then be used by others to develop rational, durable strategies to control these important plant pathogens. The project, which relies on the combined expertise and resources of U.S. and African participants, provides an excellent framework for training U.S. students to develop their scientific skills and to work in a global community to help ensure the future security of the developing and developed world.<br/><br/>Molecular evolution of plant viruses occurs through mutation, recombination and reassortment of viral genome components, resulting in a high degree of variation. In complex pathogen-host systems, the evolutionary outcomes are influenced by many ecological factors including agricultural practices, insect vector populations, interactions between crops and reservoir plants, and climate. Most of our knowledge of viral evolution is based on field-collected samples, which only provide snapshots of viral diversity at specific times and locations. To examine the full evolutionary potential of plant DNA viruses and the bottlenecks that constrain their evolution, we propose a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of viral genetic diversity, emergence, persistence and spread under tightly controlled experimental conditions. We will focus on the DNA viruses that cause Cassava mosaic disease using NexGen sequencing to compare their diversity during vegetative and whitefly transmission, in mixed infections, and in wild plants that serve as reservoir hosts. We will ask if movement through the host plant and/or transmission by insect vectors serve as bottlenecks that limit viral diversity. Our study of the evolutionary potential and factors that contribute to Cassava mosaic disease is transformative in that it will provide a comprehensive framework for examining viral evolution in relationship to the host, the insect vector and the environment using a crop and inoculation methods that accurately reflect real world conditions. Our integrated approach will also serve as a model for examining viral evolution and will inform the development of control strategies for other insect-transmitted viruses that negatively impact plant, animal and human health. Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates will be mentored by a strong international research team, which includes experts on viral population genetics, insect vector transmission and population dynamics, virus/vector/plant interactions, and STEM education. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will provide trainees experience in laboratory and field-based research as well as bioinformatics. This will prepare them to become globally engaged, independent scientists with a solid foundation in a range of research methodologies and environments and first-hand experience in international and multidisciplinary collaborations."

First, to develop students? cross-disciplinary scientific research skills by embedding them in projects and facilities that are not available at a small undergraduate institution.  To achieve this goal, each student will join a research group and project in the Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry at Strathcylde for a summer of research.  The second goal is to prepare students to thrive in an interdependent and multicultural scientific environment (and future career) by emphasizing the cultural aspects of the experience.  This program produces increased cross-cultural awareness and competence - derived from a pre-trip cultural competence course, cultural seminars overseas, and the experience of living and working in another culture for a summer. In order to support broader participation in this project, special effort is given to recruiting into the program students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  <br/><br/>The research that the students will undertake is cutting-edge and highly relevant to today?s world. While at Strathclyde, our students will carry out individual projects related to alternative energy technology, nanoscience and materials chemistry.  In particular, they will work on self-assembled organic photovoltaic materials, redox flow battery systems, and nanoparticle assemblies for healthcare diagnostics and therapy.  The students will benefit from working on some of the most advanced instrumentation available, while collaborating with researchers who are pre-eminent in their fields. All students will present their work at local and national meetings, and we expect that many of the students will also contribute to peer-reviewed publications, thus helping to disseminate their results to the broader scientific community."

At the workshop these experts will identify the main barriers to underrepresented group participation in international research, develop a set of best practices for increasing inclusion, explore methods for project evaluation, and discuss the types of institutional support needed to establish, maintain and promote such experiences to a more diverse set of American undergraduate students. This workshop aims to assemble a network of experts to explore the dynamics of international engagement by minority students, distill their findings into a report, and disseminate effective practices to various groups, including higher education institutions, professional societies, NGOs, and the private sector, that can broaden participation and enable a more diverse set of undergraduate students to undertake research abroad opportunities.  <br/><br/>This two-day workshop will bring together a set of STEM faculty that have been successful in developing sustainable research abroad programs with a focus on recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students. The workshop will explore how to increase the number of URMs undertaking international STEM research opportunities, recognizing the complexity of this effort.  A more diverse set of U.S. students doing international research will result when we successfully navigate complex interactions between, for example, the educational and cultural perspectives of different U.S. minority groups, the ways that different scientific disciplines engage internationally, the variation in support structures for diversity and international engagement across different educational institutions, and the cultural and scientific landscapes of the many countries where the students might conduct research. <br/><br/>The materials produced by the workshop will be broadly disseminated through various means such as academic networks, professional societies, and networks and PI meetings of various NSF programs focused on diversity and international research. <br/><br/>The workshop has the potential to deliver many positive outcomes, including 1) increased awareness of the national need both for U.S. STEM students to be globally engaged, and for greater diversity in that population of students; 2) increased opportunities for URM students to participate in research abroad; 3) enhanced ability both of minority-serving institutions to participate in STEM research abroad programs, as well as of majority institutions to diversify the range of students who participate in STEM research abroad; and 4) strengthened relationships among a broad range of organizations that can help implement such programs, e.g., scientific societies, educational organizations, funding agencies, and international counterpart organizations of all of these groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalysis represents the most important general technology in industrial chemistry. More than 80 percent of all chemical products, from pharmaceuticals to high-performance materials, result from use of catalysts at least once during their synthesis. Thus, the development of new and improved catalysts is a central topic in chemistry with huge environmental and economic benefits. Given Heidelberg's prominence in the field of catalysis (as evidenced by the work of several of the 18 winners of the Chemistry Nobel Prize affiliated with the University of Heidelberg) and the structured, long-term character of the proposed program, the students will not only gain the skills and experience but also have networking opportunities to thrive in today's international, interconnected world of science and business.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The research is divided into four broad areas covering a range of modern topics in catalysis that are common areas of strength researchers at the Universities of Notre Dame and Heidelberg: (i) Ligands, methodology and mechanisms in gold catalysis (Hashmi), (ii) chiral catalysts with polydentate stereodirecting ligands (Gade), (iii) Oxidation catalysis with high-valent transition metal complexes (Comba) and (iv) Single-Molecule Catalysis (Herten). The individual projects cover organic, metalorganic and physical chemistry aspects of catalysis are designed to interface the research interests of faculty members at the two participating universities. They incorporate a large number of new concepts such as a) new privileged ligand scaffolds that allow the precise positioning of directing groups, e.g. for nitrogen transfer reactions, b) new types of gold-catalyzed reactions such as photoredox catalysis without a secondary metal, c) novel ligands for the stabilization of biomimetic high-valent metals in catalysis and (d) the study of elementary reaction steps of important catalytic reactions such as metathesis or epoxidation reactions at the single molecule level. Their unifying principle is a rigorous structure- and mechanism-based approach whereby a range of advanced experimental and computational tools are used to generate a hypothesis, which is then tested experimentally in an iterative and accelerated fashion."

Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.<br/><br/>The integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

PI: Guillermo Aguilar, University of California, Riverside (UCR)<br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract: <br/>This award grant provides funding for the development of an international partnership for research and education between UCR - one of America's few research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) - and three premier institutions in Mxico: Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico (UNAM) in Mexico City; and Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica, ptica y Electrnica (INAOE) in Puebla. SOMBRERO aims at further developing the concept of a transparent cranial implant made of nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized-zirconia (nc-YSZ) - the so called Windows to the Brain (WttB) platform - to replace portions of the skull and thus allow non-invasive optical interrogation of the brain facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of brain pathologies and neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.  Although a number of materials (e.g., titanium, alumina, acrylic, etc.) have been evaluated for use in cranial reconstruction, none provide the requisite combination of properties required for clinically-viable transparent implants. Our preliminary efforts have already demonstrated that nc-YSZ offers significant promise in this regard. Furthermore, the educational component of this award aims at jointly training students from the US and Mxico in line with various current education policy initiatives in both countries, including: a) the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative, as well as the ""100,000 strong in the Americas"" initiative to increase study in Latin America and the Caribbean, among others in Mxico and within the UC system. SOMBRERO's innovations will provide a new neurotechnology platform that will eventually serve as a critical enabler for longitudinal studies of the brain, as well as the development of a host of emerging laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for neurological disorders. Concurrently, SOMBRERO will provide research opportunities to a diverse cadre of US students, preparing them to innovate as independent, globally engaged engineers. <br/><br/>Technical<br/>This study encompasses international collaborative research between UCR and three premier institutions in Mxico: Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico (UNAM) in Mexico City; and Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica, ptica y Electrnica (INAOE) in Puebla. So far, these collaborations have produced numerous advances in opto-ceramics. Particularly noteworthy is the recent report of the first transparent nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized-zirconia (nc-YSZ) cranial implants capable of replacing portions of the skull to allow non-invasive optical interrogation of the brain on an ongoing recurring basis, i.e. the Windows to the Brain (WttB) platform, which is the primary integrative technology goal of the project. The significance of SOMBRERO lies in the potential the WttB platform may eventually afford for: a) advancing understanding of the brain, by facilitating the clinical translation of emerging optogenetic neurotechnologies under development in the BRAIN Initiative; and b) facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of brain pathologies and neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.  Although a number of materials (e.g., titanium, alumina, acrylic, etc.) have been evaluated for use in cranial reconstruction, none provide the requisite combination of properties required for clinically-viable transparent implants. As such, this award proposes to take the next steps towards clinical translation of the WttB concept by advancing both our fundamental understanding and technological capabilities within this context. SOMBRERO's innovations will provide a new neurotechnology platform that will eventually serve as a critical enabler for longitudinal studies of the brain, as well as the development of a host of emerging laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for neurological disorders. The impact of SOMBRERO will lie in the unique capabilities it will provide to the neuroscience community, which will advance understanding and improve disease management, thus improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs. Furthermore, the advances made in the science and technology of novel opto-ceramics will have potential to extend to numerous other fields, including medical lasers, defense, energy, etc. Finally, SOMBRERO will recruit UCR STEM students in multiple disciplines for training in both countries, and build upon UCR's strong record of minority undergraduate retention and graduate recruitment by leveraging well-established programs and student organizations, such as the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS), and the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)."

Some plant chemicals are ingredients in products including cosmetics and botanical supplements. The most common plant chemicals have been discovered and rediscovered leaving only those present at very low concentrations to be found. Chemicals structures can change when living tissue is harvest and those concentrated in specific plant parts may be diluted in complex plant extracts. A method capable of detecting tissue and cell specific compounds from live, intact plant material would be very useful. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Tsutomu Masujima at the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center in Osaka, Japan. Dr. Masujima has developed a technique of live single cell mass spectrometry (LiveSC/MS). LiveSC/MS is capable of detecting hundreds of compounds in a non-destructive manner from individual cells in living plant tissue. Using LiveSC/MS to probe single plant cells may lead to the discovery of new compounds present at low concentrations that often are not detected by standard mass spectrometry methods. <br/><br/>LiveSC/MS will be applied to medicinal plants to compare chemical profiles of intact live cells to those of a bulk extracts. The degree of cell heterogeneity and the distribution of specific chemicals among plant cells will be established. To increase the concentrations of novel compounds plants will be exposed to methyl jasmonate, a plant hormone that induces plant defense mechanisms including the synthesis of certain chemicals. Using LiveSC/MS to evaluate intact plant material may facilitate the discovery of novel compounds present at high levels in individual cells that are not detectable in homogenized bulk extractions. Development of LiveSC/MS using highly tractable plant cells will be applicable to other biological systems to better understand molecular biology on a cell specific level.

Hydrogen fuel cells are one of the most promising technologies for addressing and mastering this task. This project takes on the challenge to advance the knowledge of processes and mechanisms occurring during operation of fuel cells at the atomic and molecular levels. The structure of materials of fuel cells at the nanometer scale of electronic structures will be probed using the instrumentation available at the Advanced Light Source facility, part of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The ability to characterize solid-liquid interfaces in fuel cells at the atomic and molecular levels under realistic operational conditions is the key to tackling some of the most fundamental and profound problems in nature as well as electrochemistry. This opportunity is extending the capacity of scientists and students from the University of New Mexico  (UNM) to conduct scientific research in this area. It will allow research faculty and students from UNM to realize New Mexico's potential for sustainable energy development through building a collaboration with state-of-the-science facilities not available at this time within the state of NM. This fellowship will not only support training of the research faculty at the forefront of analytical chemistry but also training of graduate students, thereby creating an opportunity for graduate students to conduct research at the interface between basic and applied science.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The best performing hydrogen-based fuel cells rely on platinum-derived electrocatalysts. The most promising class of alternative platinum-group-metal-free materials is based on graphene-like carbon containing nitrogen and transition metal (Metal, Nitrogen, Carbon material; MNC). Understanding the specific roles of nitrogen and metal in fuel cell properties, such as activity, stability, and durability, is a prerequisite for the rational design of fuel cell electrocatalysts with improved performance. The goal of the project is the investigation of structures of electrodes using operando spectroscopic techniques and determining specific roles of chemical structures in the reaction within complete fuel cell operating under applied potential in the presence of oxidants for cathodic and reductants for anodic reactions. The chemical structure of electrode materials, reactants, and products will be studied under applied potential using ambient-pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) utilizing the synchrotron light source in a realistic fuel cell experiment. Of fundamental interest to this project is understanding the mechanism of fuel cell reactions at the molecular level. The conversion between electrical and chemical energy occurs in the interface region between a solid electrode material, liquid electrolyte, and gaseous phase. Developing methods for probing the tri-phase interphase under different applied potentials in operando will be pursued. probing the tri-phase interphase under different applied potentials in operando will be pursued. Comprehensive understanding based on a study of full electrode systems under operando conditions will result in the identification of the role that each type of chemistry present in an MNC electrode has in the reaction.

Yet even the same genes can have very different effects depending on the environment in which an organism develops and lives, with life-long or even multigenerational effects on physical traits when exposed to environmental stress.  How these changes are accomplished at the molecular level is poorly understood, despite being critical for successful adjustment of the body to acute and chronic stress conditions.  In this project, the researchers will investigate the epigenetic response to stressful temperatures in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, along with closely related species living in diverse environments, as a model for uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which cells detect and respond to environmental stress.  This work will provide research and training opportunities for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge genomic sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analysis, with STEM outreach to high-school students from under-served urban and rural communities in three EPSCoR jurisdictions (Vermont, Rhode Island, and Kentucky). In addition, five new faculty members will be mentored as part of this project.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>In this project, a team of researchers from VT, RI, and KY will work collaboratively to test the hypothesis that epigenetic regulators act as an intermediary between environmental sensors and protein production, altering the set of genes available for transcription at the level of chromatin accessibility and then fine-tuning expression through the action of epitranscriptomic molecules. The primary objectives are to determine: 1) whether and how epigenetic mechanisms mediate plastic changes in thermal tolerance; 2) the extent to which epigenetic variation underlies natural segregating variation in phenotypic plasticity; and 3) the role of epigenetic divergence in shifting capacity for acclimation over evolutionary time.  To identify epigenetic mechanisms driving plasticity, the project team will characterize changes in chromatin accessibility, post-translational histone modification, miRNA and lncRNA associated with developmental acclimation, adult-reversible acclimation, and rapid hardening in response to high and low temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster. Functional genetic manipulations will be used to validate candidate causal epigenetic mechanisms.  Genome-wide association mapping and experimental evolution approaches will be employed to evaluate the genetic architecture of thermal plasticity.  Finally, to test whether niche transitions to colder or warmer habitats are accompanied by evolutionary gains or losses of these plastic responses, the researchers will reconstruct the history of evolutionary shifts in capacity for thermal plasticity in species across New World species of Drosophila.  The project will establish comparative and experimental models for understanding the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms of thermal plasticity that are ideally suited to address long-standing hypotheses concerning the drivers of plasticity, and investigate the ecological and evolutionary role of plasticity in promoting organismal resilience in the face of rapid, progressive shifts in climate.

This research will study the function of two crustacean species, the mantis shrimp and a copepod, which have vastly different eyes than most other animals. This fellowship will take place in the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware, working with an internationally recognized researcher in crustacean visual physiology and behavior. The fellowship will provide training to the PI and a graduate student in techniques that measure changes in electrical output of cells to characterize changes in eye function over the course of development. By studying these two species in particular, and coupling newly learned techniques with the PI's expertise in evolutionary studies through DNA analysis, the proposed research will reveal how developmental changes in visual systems affect the behavior of an animal. The knowledge gained in the project will be integrated into a newly developed course in Sensory Biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM). In addition, the work will be used to provide summer research experience to undergraduates through two funded UHM NSF funded REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) summer programs, one of which specifically targets the involvement of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This fellowship will provide training for the PI and a graduate student in crustacean-specific electrophysiology and behavioral techniques, providing them with the interdisciplinary tools to link molecular evolution with physiological function and behavioral output for a truly integrated research program in visual system evolution. The work will focus on generating novel ontogenetic datasets for two crustaceans with unique eyes, the stomatopodSquilla empusaand the copepodLabidocera aestiva, to investigate the development and evolution of sensory system diversification. Specific project goals are to characterize complex stomatopod and simple copepod eyes using electrophysiology to describe underlying photoreceptor diversity and function, and behavioral assays to establish when particular visual capabilities become functional during development. The addition of two new methodologies for studies of visual system form and function will be transformative for the PI's research program, generating broad, integrative training for both undergraduate and graduate students and making future proposals more competitive through more integrated experimental designs. Conversely, time spent at the University of Delaware will allow for reciprocal training in molecular techniques for members of the host laboratory, thus providing the same integrative training across two institutions. The proposed project will establish a collaboration between leaders in the fields of crustacean molecular evolution and visual physiology, as well as strengthen newly-initiated collaborations with other research units at the PI's home institution."

The study of metabolites produced in living cells and  tissues is broadly termed 'metabolomics'. Metabolomics can provide information on how changes in a cell?s environment impacts those complex biochemical networks. Monitoring the concentrations of metabolites over time can provide essential information about the health of an organism. Metabolomics is emerging as an integral technology to understand the function of a wide variety of biological systems in response to a range of conditions, including disease, drug treatment, and exposure to pests or pathogens. The PI will work with colleagues at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to answer fundamental questions about the flow of metabolites in bacterial cells, which will broadly impact areas of research where understanding basic cellular metabolic processes are important. The project will not only improve the PI's research trajectory, but is also likely to result in significant advances in methods used to study metabolic processes in industrially and environmentally important bacteria. This project will provide interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at Boise State University and regional high school students from demographically diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The goal of this project is to decipher carbon utilization in the metabolic pathways of two strains of live fermenting bacteria, Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium thermocellum, both available at NREL. Achieving this goal will provide insights into pathway reversibility and carbon flux at the systems level. Information gained from this study will guide rational bioengineering efforts to optimize biofuel and chemical product output, and increase carbon utilization efficiency. The overarching strategy of this project is to combine advanced in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with 13C-isotope enriched metabolic tracers and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) to measure intra- and extracellular metabolic flux (13C-fluxomics) in these microbes. The proposed research will: (1) expand basic science knowledge of metabolic flux in living systems across the molecular, subcellular, and cellular scales using in-cell NMR; and (2) unlock deep fundamental insights into the cellular bioenergetics of fermenting biomass while mitigating CO2 production. This research integrates several novel approaches that will allow real time analysis of 13C-fluxomics."

Accompanying the winter warming trends are fewer days with snow cover, reductions in snow water equivalent, an increased proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain instead of snow, and more frequent mid-winter thaw events. The rapid pace of winter climate change is hypothesized to have large impacts on the natural functioning of ecosystems and corresponding ecosystem services. The vision of the proposed project is to directly address the need for high-resolution, comprehensive historical and future climate model simulations to investigate future winter climate under higher and lower emissions scenarios across the United States. The PI will collaborate with scientists at the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, a premier, internationally recognized center for climate modeling. The project outcomes will provide high quality, foundational climate model simulations to advance understanding of winter climate impacts on ecosystem services, engage external partners in the winter tourism industry, and support competitive research at the University of New Hampshire, including in the areas of crop and hydrological modeling. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this project is that changes in winter climate will have profound impacts on a suite of ecosystem services across the contiguous United States as climate responds to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.

As one of the apex predators and by having extensive lipid-rich blubber layers, the bottlenose dolphin is more susceptible to the bioaccumulation of lipid soluble marine contaminants. Many of these contaminants are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phthalates, that can adversely impact the female reproductive functions of marine mammals. Studies related to investigating the effect of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphin reproduction are dependent on recording whether a dolphin can be pregnant and produce a viable calf. However, it is difficult to monitor the specific impact of EDC's on the ovary and its related functions. The central objective of this research proposal is to use the cryopreservation and 3D microfluidic technologies to engineer the bottlenose dolphin ovarian function in vitro. The proposed research will allow the establishment of a high-throughput ovarian toxicity screening platform to determine the reproductive toxicity of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphins as well as other marine mammals.<br/><br/>Technical description of the project<br/>The ovary is the primary female reproductive organ and contains follicles at various developmental stages. The follicle primarily functions to secrete sex steroid hormones and to support its enclosed germ cell oocyte for maturation, ovulation, and fertilization. The goal of the proposed research is to visit the host site at Oregon Health and Science University to learn ovarian tissue cryopreservation and the in vitro growth of follicles from large mammalian species. The first research objective of research one is to cryopreserve mouse ovarian follicles through vitrification for establishing a long-term follicle storage platform. The PI will culture follicles in vitro and examine the follicle reproductive outcomes to investigate the effect of vitrification on follicle and oocyte health and also determine the vitrification-induced cell injury. The second research objective is to cryopreserve bottlenose dolphin ovarian follicles and use microfluidic technology to engineer dolphin ovarian function in vitro. We will collect and cryopreserve ovaries from fresh-dead, stranded bottlenose dolphins, use the microfluidic platform to support a long-term dolphin follicle development and maturation, and validate this system by testing known ovarian toxic chemicals. The proposed work will allow the development of a high-throughput platform to study the female reproductive toxicity of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphins and enhance PI and his team's research ability in female reproductive toxicology in marine animals. The broader impact of this study will result in a platform that can be used for cryopreserving ovarian tissues and for other cell/tissue types.

This information, in turn, will elucidate how these changes modify the characteristics of organisms. This research will contribute to basic scientific knowledge and will benefit society by advancing biotechnology, agriculture, and human health. The work on protein binding, for example, will improve the ability to predict which pathogens will evade drug therapy or which molecules might interfere with protein function. The project will provide resources to support early-career faculty and mentor them in building robust, interdisciplinary, collaborative research programs. It will also provide collaborative opportunities to students and postdocs and prepare them for cutting-edge scientific careers. The research is team-based, involving scientists and students in Idaho, Vermont, and Rhode Island. Findings will be shared with the public via interactive animations, a website for dissemination of results, and presentations for diverse audiences in all three states including local science centers, schools, and regional Tribal communities. The project will promote a diverse, vibrant, and sustainable workforce and provide opportunities for research, education, and outreach.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The research will utilize protein biophysical tools to develop genome to phenome analyses that predict the impact of mutations and combinations of mutations on a broad range of systems. The central scientific hypothesis for the project is that protein biophysical models provide an efficient framework for predicting how mutations influence protein stability, affinity for substrates and partners, and the mappings to higher-level phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, the research team will computationally predict the effect of mutations on folding and binding stabilities and experimentally validate the predictions by protein purification, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry. The use of computational approach first to select biophysically viable mutants will lead to efficient experimental efforts. Initial studies will focus on beta-lactamase and the respiratory syncytial virus F protein because they represent two fundamental interaction types: protein-substrate and protein-protein.  The researchers will investigate how single mutations and combinations of mutations affect biophysical phenotypes and their mappings to higher-level phenotypes in these two systems. Further studies will focus on larger, naturally occurring, mutational combinations and the role of the environment in modifying the genotype to phenotype mappings. The research will identify generic and system-specific lessons about the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, such as how often biophysical and higher-level phenotypes show epistasis and how well models predict deviations from additivity. Participating early career faculty will receive mentoring for advancement in their academic career and will have networking opportunities for professional development.  The project will develop a website to aid in the communication of project results, tools, and activities.  Students and scientists will work with animators and virtual technology and design experts to produce interactive animations called ""Geno-Pheno-Mations"" to disseminate the project results to the general public."

The UNVEIL network will also provide an ideal environment for the development of early career faculty and for training postdoctoral fellows and students in cutting-edge science and the ethical complexities of using genomic insights in conservation.<br/> <br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Newly developed systems genetics approaches to understand the links between genotype and phenotype have rarely been applied to natural populations in the context of environmental gradients.  This project seeks to meet this challenge by harnessing systems genetics to advance the understanding of the genetic basis of fitness-related traits in natural populations. The focus will be on three distinct species: the snowshoe hare for its seasonal color molts; deer mice for its hypoxia response to altitude changes; and Yellowstone monkeyflowers for its survival on hot soils. These scientific research activities are paired with an ethics project explicitly considering whether, when, and how to translate genomic knowledge into conservation interventions. The project engages early-career faculty in research, education, and outreach activities and mentors them for leading positions as they progress in their careers.  In addition, the project will provide independent research opportunities to postdoctoral fellows and interdisciplinary training to graduate students and empower the next generation of genome scientists to apply genomic insights to conservation challenges. Recruitment of postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students will focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented minority groups. Annual symposia, workshops, exchange visits, and other training opportunities will be coordinated by faculty members at UM and UNL together with other network members from state and federal organizations. Stakeholder communications will be facilitated by video products created by media arts students and scientists working together in translating the research results and scientific concepts for general audiences."

Experimental assessment of IAQ is not always feasible and is very expensive. As a result, engineers and building scientists employ computer simulations to model the movement of indoor air and contaminants. These simulations, however, are severely limited by their computational intensity. This fellowship will enable the PI to develop a new approximation methodology for modeling indoor air patterns. This approach is called Event Based Modeling (EBM). The PI will collaborate with colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) to develop and validate the EBM approach in the Building Science Lab at UC Berkeley, which is among the largest university laboratories in the world. A successful development of EBM will result in method to optimize building energy consumption while improving air quality. Providing clean air in hospitals is crucial as pathogens can be transported through air, leading to healthcare associated infection (HAI). In the United States, HAIs cost between $35- $45 billion and claim 90,000 lives each year. EBM will be a new tool for designing hospitals that are safe and efficient. This research will support dissemination of this new knowledge in the classroom, where the future generation of designers is educated.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a new and innovative methodology called the event-based modeling (EBM) approach to simulate airflow patterns for realistic human-environment interactions. EBM can provide a path to simulate complex, random human-environment interactions that are pragmatically impossible to solve using current approaches. The PI will investigate the validity, characterize a range of applicability, and determine the practical limitations of EBM. The fellowship will take place in the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) at the University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with internationally recognized building scientists. The fellowship will provide an opportunity for the PI to conduct experiments in an environmental chamber that allows control over the levels of temperature, humidity, and ventilation. This project will advance the knowledge of indoor air modeling by: (1) developing a new approximation approach (i.e., EBM) to air movement in the indoor environment; (2) testing the accuracy and validity of the approach; and (3) characterizing circumstances under which this approach may be utilized. This work has the potential to transform the future of research on transient indoor airflow patterns. An accurate assessment of indoor air quality improves our quality of life. EBM will transform the current approach to building ventilation design by enabling just enough air to be conditioned and distributed to where it is needed, thus saving energy. A promising application of the proposed work is in hospitals where controlling airborne disease transmission is critical. Using the event-based modeling approach, smart air control systems could be designed to improve healthcare outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy poverty, or lack of access to modern energy services, has serious implications for the well-being of individuals and communities, the environment, and impacts economic growth. This project seeks to understand the impact of strategies to improve access to modern energy in Southern Africa, a region with low energy access. The researchers will evaluate the environmental and human impacts of approaches that rely on promotion of new technologies and/or incentives for behavior change to mitigate energy poverty. They will investigate the social, demographic, and spatial dimensions of energy poverty by analyzing geographic variables, and consider the optimal scale of interventions for maximizing environmental benefits and human well-being. The researchers will use social ecological systems frameworks and theories of population and environment dynamics to study energy poverty. They will foster and sustain a network of academic, practitioner, and policy communities to fill critical gaps in the strategies used to mitigate energy poverty. This project will train over 70 postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers from disciplines as diverse as anthropology and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>Sub-Saharan Africa is an epicenter of energy poverty, defined as the lack of access to electricity and reliance on biomass fuels. In Southern Africa, the absolute number of energy poor is projected to increase through 2050. Energy poverty has implications for climate, environmental sustainability, human health, and well-being, with negative impacts realized at individual and collective-scales, and in local, regional, and global contexts. The researchers' goal is to build an interdisciplinary evidence base and network for transformative change. They will center their research and educational program around two themes: evaluating technology and incentives; and population and environment dynamics. Using rigorous impact evaluation research designs, they will measure the air quality, land use, and human welfare impacts of a representative set of novel and scalable technology and behavioral interventions designed to mitigate energy poverty. The researchers will use life-cycle analysis to evaluate temporal trade-offs and synergies between environmental and social outcomes. In the second theme, they will investigate the social, demographic, and spatial dimensions of energy poverty by analyzing geographic variables as determinants of energy poverty, and consider the question of optimal scale of implementation of interventions for maximizing environmental benefits and human well-being. Using their comparative research design, they will explore the relationship between energy poverty and urbanization and migration, and shocks such as droughts and political instability. The research is innovative for two reasons. First, it uses rigorous interdisciplinary impact evaluation as the anchor. The team will study what works, why it works, and over what spatial and temporal scale. Second, the study of energy poverty is highly fragmented across a large number of disciplines with very little cross-fertilization or engagement with interdisciplinary frameworks (e.g., complex socio-ecological systems and population and environment dynamics). The researchers will use these  theoretical lenses to shed new light on this problem, and  guide a coherent body of empirical research in an understudied region.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences."

Halting AMR is a complex task because natural background levels of AMR vary worldwide, there are many ways that humans impact AMR, and because natural and human impacts interact in different ways around the world to influence how multi-antimicrobial resistant ""super-bugs"" arise and are transmitted.  Although substantial effort has focused on lessening hospital-derived resistance, the spread of AMR has continued to accelerate, thus creating new attention to diminishing the spread and/or transmission of AMR in the wastewater environment. Wastewater treatment plants are a logical focus because they serve as collection points for resistant organisms and antimicrobial compounds from a wide variety of sources (i.e., hospitals, industries, households) and they are potential breeding grounds for environmental dissemination of AMR. Antimicrobial drugs and other chemical stressors (e.g., heavy metals, biocides) regularly enter wastewater treatment plants and may select for resistant organisms, while also stimulating them to produce and share the DNA elements responsible for resistance. This PIRE project, Halting Environmental Antimicrobial Resistance Dissemination [HEARD], will 1) quantify how wastewater treatment processes affect different aspects of AMR (e.g., the antimicrobial drugs, AMR organisms, and the DNA elements underlying AMR) across a global transect of wastewater treatment plants, 2) determine how the characteristics of wastewater treatment plants and the receiving environment (e.g., river, lake, or pipe network) interact to affect the spread of AMR, and 3) develop and test novel approaches to stop the spread of AMR originating from wastewater treatment plants. The international team assembled for this PIRE project includes researchers from four U.S. institutions and six other countries (China, India, Philippines, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland). The international dimensions of this project are essential because 1) the propagation of AMR is of global concern, 2) the use and disposal of antimicrobials and wastewater management practices differ significantly from one society to another, and 3) international research collaboration prepares U.S. students to be part of a globally engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>Three overarching hypotheses drive HEARD: Hypothesis 1: wastewater treatment plant influents can be monitored to gauge the impacts of local antimicrobial use and disposal practices on the prevalence of resistant organisms and resistance elements.  Hypothesis 2: A broad gradient of antimicrobial resistance elements and resistant bacteria are present in wastewater effluents across the globe. Hypothesis 3: wastewater treatment processes and receiving environments can be chosen or modified to mitigate the spread of antimicrobial resistance. To address these hypotheses and answer these questions we have developed a comprehensive research plan organized around three research thrusts: Thrust 1: Global Reconnaissance of Antimicrobial Drugs, Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, and Resistance Element Fate During Wastewater Treatment; Thrust 2: The Relative Roles of Wastewater Treatment Plants and Receiving Environments in Resistance Dissemination; and Thrust 3: Advancing Wastewater Treatment Technologies for Antimicrobial Drug, Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, and Resistance Element Removal. HEARD brings together four U.S. universities and ten international academic institutions. The project's initial focus will be to globally track and quantify the concentrations of a select group of target resistance elements (e.g., NDM-1, intI1, blaTEM, vanA, and sul1) within wastewater treatment plant influents and effluents in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. In parallel, the project members will utilize metagenomics to detect nontarget resistance elements and bacteria. The metagenomic information will then direct and refine future targeted sampling efforts across the global transect of field sites. To develop solutions to the threat of wastewater mediated resistance dissemination the team will examine both at field and laboratory scale how changes in wastewater treatment plant operational variables (e.g., F/M ratio, solids retention time, and aerobic/anaerobic conditions) affect both resistant bacteria and resistance elements.  The project's international partners synergistically provide the U.S.-based PIRE students with intracultural context, international research experience with access to world-class collaborators and facilities, and unique expertise in antimicrobial resistance and the global threat of resistance dissemination.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems of NSF's Directorate for Engineering."

The assignment of U.S. engineers overseas has become common business practice, as global enterprises establish corporate as well as research and development centers worldwide. To remain at the forefront of science and technology and to sustain our nation's global leadership in engineering, we must train our engineering graduates to be productive professionals in tomorrow's global business world and provide them the skills they will need to collaborate with international partners. This three-year IRES program will teach some of those critical skills to U.S. engineering students by providing hands-on research training and cultural experiences in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. The students will conduct research in Egypt with U.S. and Egyptian investigators in the increasingly important field of sustainable urban design. The need for sustainable housing and infrastructure is particularly acute in Egypt, a nation where 95% of the population lives on just 6% of the land area. Students will leverage the many national research initiatives currently underway in Egypt to investigate and test sustainable infrastructure designs. Participants will receive extensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from the U.S. and Egyptian researchers, with the ultimate goal of conducting high-level research and preparing research papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals. By working closely with their international mentors, the students will enhance their cross-cultural skills, foreign language abilities, and professional experience, preparing them to excel in a multinational environment.<br/><br/>This three-year IRES project will provide approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate engineering students research training and cultural experiences in Egypt. The students will work with U.S. mentors and Egyptian researchers at one of the leading national research centers in Egypt, the National Housing and Building Research Center. The program will focus on the multidisciplinary theme of Infrastructure Design for Sustainable Urban Communities. The Egyptian government is currently pressing major research initiatives and demonstration projects related to sustainable urban design, including entire new cities built around sustainability principles. Our students will leverage these ongoing programs to explore and evaluate new designs for urban infrastructure that consider building materials, construction methods, energy efficiency, and water conservation. Working with our Egyptian partners, the researchers have identified eight research projects for the first year of the program that address the topics of sustainable affordable housing, the assessment of sustainable building codes, infrastructure health monitoring, sustainable building materials, water and stormwater management, and intelligent building designs. Additional research topics will be developed in subsequent years. Students will work side-by-side with Egyptian researchers with the goal of performing high-level research and producing student-led, peer-reviewed publications. The program will ultimately produce students who have the skills and international perspective necessary to pursue careers in collaborative international research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complete immersion in Japanese society by spending four to eight weeks in Kyushu University will provide an opportunity to experience and understand the people, traditions and culture. The cultural and scientific exposure that the U.S. students will obtain from this international collaboration will be invaluable. Kyushu University is one of the top-ranked universities in Japan, and the cosmopolitan metropolis of Fukuoka is welcoming to foreigners. This opportunity is expected to enhance the global competitiveness of the participating students in the STEM workforce, and will be made available to qualified U.S. students, especially those underrepresented in science and engineering, by broadly reaching out to the California State university system, the Univ. of California system, and students attending professional conferences organized for example, by the American Chemical Society and Materials Research Society.<br/><br/>In this international collaboration, four U.S. undergraduate and/ or graduate participants per year will perform fundamental research on triplet-fusion based photon upconversion both in California and Japan. The fusion of molecular excited states with triplet character is the only method for directly upconverting photons from the sun. While these high photon upconversion quantum yields have been demonstrated in volatile organic solvents, they are generally lower in thin film due to poor triplet exciton diffusion. The U.S. students will be synthesizing and fabricating liquid or thin-films of semiconductor nanocrystals and molecular emitters organized in various hosts, including proteins, organogels and surfactants, to understand and control the diffusion of photogenerated triplet excitons. This project aims to use semiconductor nanocrystals to absorb light strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths to address one of the major limitations in molecular triplet photosensitizers. The hybrid nanomaterials will be designed to halt the spontaneous crystallization of the molecular emitter with nitrene crosslinking chemistry; increase triplet diffusion lengths in liquids or thin films with long-range order in covalent organic frameworks and establish a barrier to oxygen to prevent the quenching of spin-triplet excitons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The production of very high-power (on the order of a few billion watts), ultra-short (a few billionth of a second) laser pulses places stringent demands on the lasing medium.  Scientists have used elegant optical techniques and plasmas (ionized gas) that can operate at extreme intensities to develop high-power pulsed lasers.  However, further advancement requires understanding processes within the amplifying medium and overcoming technological challenges that limit the output power. This project focuses on achieving increased output power of plasma based ultrafast lasers by combining the expertise and instrumentation available at Delaware State University with those of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  The fellowship grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) provides the Principal Investigator (PI) and her students the support needed to pursue an integrated effort involving experiments, theory, and simulations.  The project offers a unique opportunity for an early career researcher and students from Delaware State University, a member of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), to train at a premier national facility in building a table-top high-power plasma laser. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The goal of this EPSCoR Research Fellowship is to achieve ultrashort (20-30 femtosecond) pulses at petawatt/exawatt/zettawatt peak power in a table-top plasma-based laser. The experiments will use Stimulated Raman Backscattering (SRBS), in which amplification of a seed laser pulse power occurs via excited plasma Langmuir waves in a configuration of counter-propagating pump and seed beams.  The seed laser will be shipped from Delaware State University and the experiments will be performed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) using a pump laser available at LLNL's Jupiter Laser Facility (JLF).  The project involves the installation of the seed laser, development of a plasma waveguide and studies of its characteristics, implementation of a single stage SRBS experiment pumped by a JLF laser, and finally a two stage (two gas jets) experiment. These experiments will explore the saturation mechanism predicted by the particle in cells (PIC) simulations by the PI's group and use an integrated effort that combines theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental investigation to address the peak power saturation in plasma-based high-power lasers.  The project provides a unique opportunity for the PI and her students to combine home institution's instrumentation with those available at large scale national facilities to conduct experiments that are guided by theory and simulation, and in turn provide useful feedback to validate and help improve theoretical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will create the foundational knowledge needed to improve wheat and rice yields under stressful environments. Trends at the global-, regional-, and farm-level point to an increase in minimum night temperatures that is significantly higher than the rate of increase in maximum day temperatures. Increases in night temperatures significantly decrease the grain yield and quality of major crops such as rice and wheat, which together provide over 50% of the caloric intake for humans worldwide. To ensure global food security, there is an urgent need to improve crop resilience to high night temperature stress-induced yield and quality losses. This project will build upon complementary expertise and infrastructure in Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas to develop novel research infrastructure and make discoveries that ultimately lead to development of higher yielding and resilient cultivars for the U.S. farmers. This program will create opportunities to collaborate with key industry partners to ensure that promising discoveries are translated into applications with economic benefit for farmers. Planned workforce development activities will focus on mentoring six early career faculty members, training of postdocs and graduate and undergraduate students, and broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities and underserved rural population in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project aims to elucidate the physiological and genetic basis of high night temperature resiliency of rice and wheat, translate these discoveries into genetic and phenotypic markers for public and private breeding programs, and develop a broad continuum for STEM education. To this end, the investigators are taking a multidisciplinary approach involving plant physiologists, quantitative geneticists, computational biologists, biochemists, engineers, informaticians, and precision agronomists. This program is building genome to phenome linkages using automated image-based phenomics approaches in combination with transcriptomics and metabolomics applied to wheat and rice diversity panels. Gene and pathways discovered from this approach will be functionally tested for their role in improving the temperature resilience in rice and wheat. The planned approach integrates across greenhouse and field scales; captures complex interactions between the environment and genome during grain development at high spatiotemporal resolution; and couples genomics and phenomics outcomes within a quantitative, model-based framework. This research will make the integrated dataset more accessible to biologists through a visualization platform.  Six early career faculty will be mentored for professional progress and interactions with international phenomic communities. An Interdisciplinary graduate course will be developed for students in plant sciences, agricultural engineering, computational biology, biochemistry, statistics, and computer sciences. On-line offerings of this course will ensure student participation from all three participating universities."

The goal of the FDP is to increase research productivity by streamlining the administrative process for research while maintaining effective stewardship of and full accountability for federal funds. More specifically, FDP strives to maximize research performance per federal dollar by minimizing the monetary and time burdens associated with the administrative aspects of federally-sponsored research. Since its inception, the FDP has successfully worked to reduce administrative burden while accommodating continuous changes to the policies and regulations most significant to research administration. <br/><br/>Through the unique forum provided by the FDP, federal agency officials work collaboratively with administrative, faculty, and technical representatives from a broad range of academic research institutions to identify and assess unnecessary burden resulting from policies and processes that can be addressed only through cooperation. Targeted projects, pilots, and demonstrations are an important and defining component of the FDP. Once a new approach is successfully beta tested by a few willing institutions and agencies within the FDP, it is generally accepted by the FDP's members and often by most research funding agencies and recipients. A study and 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on ""Optimizing the Nation's Investment in Academic Research"" cites and references the work of the FDP throughout.   The work that the FDP has accomplished in the past has achieved national recognition and the current proposal outlines further plans for maximizing federal investments in research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

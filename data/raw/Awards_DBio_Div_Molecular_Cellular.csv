A major unsolved question is how the genome is packaged and organized in this tiny three-dimensional space. This project seeks to address this question by developing novel theoretical and computational approaches to characterize the three-dimensional organization of the human genome. A Google Map-like resource for the genome will be designed such that one can easily navigate through its hierarchical organization across multiple length scales. This will prove an invaluable aid for studying genetic mechanisms related to the translation of information in the DNA genome to the RNA and protein molecules that constitute the ""workhorses"" of the cell. The project will also provide excellent interdisciplinary training that bridges chemistry, physics and biology for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a predictive genome model with an integrative framework that combines statistical mechanics and computational modeling with bioinformatics analysis. Novel theoretical approaches will be developed to derive the two key components of the model, including (1) an input sequence that uniquely represents a chromosome from a given cell type; and (2) a force field that describes the potential energy surface whose global minimum determines the most stable genome structure. To capture the variation of genome conformation across cell types, epigenetic information--including histone modifications, which are reflective of ""chromatin states""--will be superimposed on top of the DNA sequence and used as input. Physical attributes will be used to maximize the information entropy. Long-range contact potentials will be derived from existing, publicly available genome-wide chromosome conformation capture data using a rigorous statistical optimization algorithm. This predictive genome model will not only enable a high-resolution characterization of the genome organization across a wide range of cell types, but can also help uncover the underlying physical principles and driving forces for genome folding. Moreover, the model will add value to the foundational biological datasets (from the human ENCODE project) and enable formulation of testable hypotheses relating genome organization to functional output<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Program for Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering in Mathematical and Statistical Sciences in the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

The second pilot will enable cancer researchers at University of Arizona Cancer Center and elsewhere to aggregate their public and private cancer image data using CyVerse's capabilities and to integrate image and genomic data via a custom user interface.

Chromosome structure in turn is regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the histones and the use of primary sequence variants of the canonical histones. Unlike its canonical counterparts, the histone variant H3.3 is deposited throughout the cell cycle in transcriptionally active regions, where it forms unstable nucleosomes. The research will examine a new potential role for H3.3 in DNA repair. The research will benefit society by promoting science education and training future scientists, while contributing to a better understanding of how histone proteins promote DNA repair. This research will be carried out with the involvement of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars and will have a broad impact on science education and the training of future scientists. Early exposure to the joys of science encourages students to pursue future careers in science. Through a college-based summer outreach program, rural and minority K-12 students will be exposed to research concepts in the PIs lab. Genetic model systems such as the budding yeast and fruit flies are ideal for educating K-12 (and undergraduate) students in the methods of scientific research and explaining genetic principles. The PI will also continue to host high school juniors in his lab each summer under the Young Scholars Program (YSP) as they work on mini-projects. These mini-projects usually perform very well at science competitions, which helps them secure admission and scholarships at top universities. <br/><br/>While the transcriptional roles of histone H3.3 are well known, recent evidence also suggests critical transcription independent roles of H3.3. Consistent with this evidence, preliminary data pointing to a crucial role for H3.3 in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair has been obtained, and this project will investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. The specific hypothesis to be tested is that histone H3.3 and its PTMs modulate chromatin structure at DNA damage sites to help recruit HR repair factors, thereby contributing to genomic integrity. The hypothesis will be tested by (i) determining the role of H3.3 in HR mediated DNA repair in distinct chromatin structures, (ii) identifying its DNA repair specific chaperones, and (iii) defining the role of H3.3 modifications in DNA repair. The research will use genome sequencing based biochemical assays, live cell microscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS) to determine the role of H3.3 and its modifications in HR-mediated DNA repair. The analyses will be carried out primarily in normal and H3.3 deficient cultured human cells, as well as in patient derived tumor cell lines carrying H3.3 mutations. A potentially useful byproduct of the MS data generated during the course of this research is the identification of novel DNA damage inducible PTMs on histones other than H3.3. Hence, the findings from this research will establish the role for H3.3 in DNA repair and will also lay the groundwork for the functional analysis of other histone variants implicated in DNA repair. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary conservation of the major processes involving chromatin and DNA repair, the research will yield useful information on mechanisms that contribute to genomic stability across eukaryotic species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are chains of small chemicals, called amino acids that are linked together. The number and order of the amino acids defines the shape or structure of the protein and also its function. Proteins fold up into compact shapes, but to do their jobs like digesting food or generating the force that makes birds and insects fly, they have to change their shape. This research is aimed at understanding how the sequence of amino acids defines the folding of proteins and how they change their shapes to function. Understanding how protein sequences control their shape and function will be of great use in designing new proteins for applications in biotechnology. For example, better, more active and more stable proteins can be designed for green chemistry bioreactors to make the chemicals used in daily life without harming the environment. Proteins are nano-machines and nanomaterials that will find numerous applications in electronics, computing, biosensing and nano-fabrication. All of these technological advances will be based on the understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, stability and function. The strong international collaboration on which this research is based will provide the students with a world-view of the scientific endeavor, and help them establish international networks that will aid them as they pursue their careers. The graduate and undergraduate students who will participate in the research will be immersed in a comprehensive interdisciplinary environment, incorporating multiple experimental and computational approaches. The large NMR data sets generated by the research are shared with the NSF sponsored undergraduate educational program in the undergraduate computer science major at RPI, the Data Analytics Through-out Undergraduate Mathematics program (DATUM). Support will be provided for the undergraduate research program run by the Center for Biotechnology. The research will also involve the RPI high school internship program run by the Center for Biotechnology for Troy area high schools (with a large minority population). <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to map experimentally the folding free energy landscapes for selected model proteins, and to identify the sequence and structural determinants of their folding cooperativity, initiation and pathways.  This will be accomplished by exploiting the advantages of pressure perturbation coupled with site specific NMR, fluorescence, SAXS and other biophysical approaches. The underlying premise of the present proposal is that pressure, due to its unique mechanism of action, can provide exclusive insights into protein folding. Within the framework of the main objective, three specific questions will be addressed:  How does sequence code for protein folding cooperativity.   How are protein cooperative interactions linked to their volumetric thermal expansion.   How do residual native interactions in pressure unfolded states affect folding mechanisms. This project  will address central outstanding issues in protein folding and conformational dynamics, first by significantly and systematically increasing the experimental database of detailed protein folding energy landscapes. Secondly, it will provide experimental scenarios describing how sequence defines folding routes and cooperativity. Finally, it will reveal how sequence specifically controls access to excited states on folding landscapes.

This NSF-BSF collaborative project aims to provide the first comprehensive view of non-hereditary molecular exchange occurring upon bacterial interspecies contact. First, researchers will investigate whether RNAs are exchanged between neighboring cells, which would expand the scope of this phenomenon. This aim also will lead to development of novel synthetic biology tools for RNA tracking and tagging. Second, researchers will perform global transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of recipient cells from mixed-species cultures in order to determine the extent and identities of RNAs and proteins that are delivered from one species to the other. The analysis in this aim also will help to establish rules or sequence barcodes that govern RNA and protein exchange.

Proteins perform  a variety of biological specific functions inside cells, operating in a crowded matrix with many other macromolecules.  The PI will recruit minority and female undergraduate students for her research program from introductory physics courses that she teaches to retain their interest in science. The University of Houston (UH) is a designated Hispanic-serving institute with over 40,000 students. The PI is a director of the Physics Science Teaching Equity Project (Physics STEP), a professional develop program for continuing education. The focus of Physics STEP is to provide training to 20 in-service non-physics teachers who are assigned to teach high-school physics each year. These 20 teachers teach a total of 3000 high-school students from high-need school districts at the greater Houston area. The opportunity for young students and teachers to learn physics would greatly improve the science literacy of our future generation. In collaboration with the College of Education at UH, the Physics STEP offers each teacher content knowledge and pedagogy, including ""inquiry-based"" experiments on selected physics topics through a yearly curriculum. The PI plans to recruit high-school students to join her research program by pairing them with teachers who participate in the Physics STEP. Additionally, through coordination with science teachers of elementary schools in STEP, the PI will reach out to fourth- and fifth-grade students by participating in a Career Day and by hosting science field trips at the UH campus. The PI will use her extensive teacher's network and experience to enhance the broader impacts of the research.  In the long term, this methodology may help reveal molecular mechanisms of cellular adaptation and regulation of protein networks in response to stress cues. The dissemination of the developed computer program through the internet will promote modeling tools that are freely available to study protein-folding in cells. <br/><br/>The objective of the research is to characterize the effects of the cellular environment on the structure and folding dynamics of model proteins. Most experiments, theories, and simulations on the structures and folding dynamics of proteins have been addressed in dilute solutions in test tubes, which are not representative of the congested biological environment in cells. The extent to which the competing effects of the cellular environment affect protein biophysics is poorly understood. There is an urgent need for the development of theories and computational methods to provide a quantitative understanding of the environmental effects that dictate protein structures and conformational dynamics in cells. Only with tools to quantitatively assess protein biophysics inside cells can a fundamental understanding of protein's behaviors in response to cellular signaling cues be achieved. The research includes three integrated directions: First, the principal investigator (PI) will apply computer simulations to quantify folding kinetics in the presence of chemical denaturants and crowded media and relate these results to similar in vitro experiments. This will allow the investigation of transition-state structures and possible movements of the transition states of protein folding in cell-like media, which can then inform the design of further in vitro experiments. Next, the PI will develop a quantitative description between energy landscape profiles and protein-folding kinetics in crowded environments, which is essential to better understand the underlying physical principles behind computer simulations and in vitro experimental data. Finally, the PI will combine computer simulations, development of improved theories, and collaboration with experimentalists to advance the knowledge of how competing cellular effects, such as macromolecular crowding, electrostatics, and hydrodynamic interactions, tune the structures and folding kinetics of proteins in cells. The research is significant because the outcome will offer molecular explanations and predictions that connect residual details of proteins to their folding processes in cells.

Outreach to the general public will also be performed, in collaboration with an artist that uses plant life-related themes in her installations.<br/><br/><br/>Protein synthesis (translation) is a major sink for the carbon and nitrogen compounds that, once assimilated through photosynthesis, drive cell growth and proliferation. The project seeks to decipher how protein synthesis-driven cell growth is connected to cell proliferation in meristematic plant cells, using the root tip of the plant reference species Arabidopsis as an experimental system. An underlying hypothesis that shall be tested is that growth regulatory signaling pathways coordinate both the cell cycle and protein synthesis in response to growth stimulating signals. To this end, cell biological markers of cell proliferation will be imaged over time in strains harboring genetic lesions in key signaling pathways. Data on translational efficiency will be collected using genome-wide techniques in order to identify the targets of translational regulation in actively growing tissues. Translation data will be fitted to an emergent computational model of mRNA translation in order to derive biochemical parameters of translation such as the initiation rate. Finally, a network model will integrate new and published data to predict cell cycle transitions in response to the signals that drive cell proliferation and translation. The project is a collaboration between two experimental labs, who have complementary expertise in the regulatory processes that underpin cell division and protein translation. The two teams are joined by two computational investigators, who likewise contribute complementary expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, pattern recognition and dynamic modeling using deterministic and probabilistic algorithms. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

Developmental flexibility (plasticity) allows plants to adapt to changing environments and is essential for their survival. In this project, a collaborative team of researchers from the US (University of Texas Austin) and the UK (Edinburgh University) will use a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to examine at the molecular level how light regulates plant development. Understanding plant responses to changing environments, including light, will allow for more efficient food production. This project will support informal science education, outreach to middle and high school students, and training in modeling and experimental techniques for postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Throughout the plant life cycle, the phytochrome family of photoreceptors detect alterations in the light environment and propagates adaptive changes in plant architecture; however it is unclear how this is executed at the molecular level. The preliminary data presented here provide compelling evidence that light controls development via the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM). HECTATE (HEC) transcription factors have recently been shown to control cell proliferation by regulating SAM genes. The preliminary data demonstrate that HECs operate through a Phytochrome Interaction Factor (PIF)-based mechanism, implying a direct molecular link between PIFs and the SAM. This study will integrate experimental and theoretical approaches to: (1) elucidate the molecular events through which light controls SAM function; (2) develop a new conceptual model for light signaling; and (3) provide technological advances in plant architecture manipulation for plant breeding. The project benefits from significant modelling and data storage/sharing resources offered by partner labs. The model will help to determine how different light regimes alter pathway dynamics and development, providing a systems level understanding of pathway behavior. The ultimate goal of the project will be to generate a molecular and systems level understanding of how light regulates organogenesis, providing a new paradigm for light signaling. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

In this context, the impact of a mutation to any single gene is often too subtle, or too entwined with the function of other genes, to be determined by direct observation. This project will achieve a critical step in overcoming this challenge by constructing a large and well-characterized mutant strain collection based on the genome of Myxococcus xanthus, an organism used to study three dimensional multi-cellular structures. The research will also develop experimental protocols to assign quantitative phenotype profiles that elucidate subtle functional changes linked to each gene, resulting in more accurate and thorough quantification of phenotype in the context of the entire genome, and a genome-scale data set related to function.<br/> <br/>In addition to providing a platform for training graduate students, all the strains and data will be made available for education purposes at the undergraduate level. These data will also become integral tools for students in an ongoing upper- division bioinformatics course at Syracuse University, and distributed to faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions to develop similar curricula for their students.

These teams will consist of biological and computer science graduate students, undergraduates, including underrepresented minorities, high school students and instructors, and international collaborators. The project also supports career development for two beginning investigators. Data generated from this project will be used to design an interactive visual data analysis interface with contributions from high school student programmers. Other activities include plant nutrient awareness events for the public and K-12 students, a summer workshop to train high school teachers and students in PCR and DNA fingerprinting, and discussions with local high school students on ethical issues related to genetic engineering. DNA sequence datasets and bioinformatics programs resulting from this project will be shared publicly, which will enable scientific activities ranging from basic research exploring mechanisms in genetics and evolution to generating markers and resources for crop improvement.<br/> <br/>This project will investigate how a species achieves stress adaptation compared to a closely related stress sensitive species by analyzing genomic signatures that lead to transcriptomic responses to stress, followed by targeted transgenics and molecular phenotyping. The overall analysis will be tested in a conceptual framework that highlights stress adaptation achieved by modifications in existing core stress response systems, and/or recruitment of new genetic components. Extremophile plants represent emerging models for understanding genetic mechanisms governing plant survival under extreme abiotic stresses. Schrenkiella parvula and Eutrema salsugineum, the two most salt-tolerant species among known wild relatives of Brassica crops, will be used as model genomes, and multiple salt stresses will be applied to study adaptation compared to the stress sensitive model A. thaliana. Genomes of both S. parvula and E. salsugineum show extensive overall synteny with the A. thaliana genome, which enables comparative studies benefiting from the wealth of genetic information available on A. thaliana. Inter-species comparative RNAseq methods are planned to uncover the dynamics of abiotic stress responsive gene regulation caused by excessive Na+, K+, or Li+ salts. Transgenic plants in all test species will be created targeting representative genes in major stress responsive units identified. Molecular level phenotyping will be achieved via ionomic and metabolomic profiling of wild-type and transgenic lines collected from control and stress-treated samples. Finally, descriptive genetic modules will be developed with a core data set linking genomic restructuring that enables improved stress adaptation in known and novel stress responsive pathways, in both stress-adapted and stress-sensitive species.

Specifically, they will focus on computational models used to study how interactions between biological molecules are affected by the physical nature of other molecules in their immediate environment. It has been shown that cells are highly crowded environments, and the nature of this ""crowding"" can significantly affect how crucial molecules interact with each other. A robust way to model such environments will allow for better predictions of cellular processes, which can have important impacts on society's collective understanding of biological systems and its ability to develop solutions when things go ""wrong"" in such systems.

They will use multiple computational models, including ones that treat the solvent implicitly and explicitly, in order to assess the extent to which the method used to model the system affects the predictions made. The team will also simulate experimentally realizable biological systems, including DNA-protein and protein-protein complexes within crowded environments. Through a tight cycle of comparing simulation predictions with experimental outcomes, they will assess and improve computational models of crowded biological environments. Finally, the team will assess whether macromolecular crowding can affect the outcome of a molecular design application.  Through computationally designing molecules meant to bind with specificity to a partner in either a crowded or uncrowded environment and experimentally testing those designs, they will determine whether accounting for macromolecular crowding in the design process is necessary for ensuring the desired binding properties of the designed molecule.

Opening of the channels and the resulting flow of K+ through the membrane is induced by a change in membrane voltage or by interaction with ligands. Because potassium channels are of such importance for normal physiological function, many organisms have evolved toxins that target channels, and these toxins have been used as important tools in the study of channel function and structure. Preliminary studies identified a toxin (Tx7335) from the eastern green mamba snake (Dendroaspis angusticeps) that increases frequency and duration of channel openings in the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. This is a very unusual function for a toxin that interacts directly with the potassium-conducting domain of the channel, as most such toxins act as blockers of K+ currents. The functional effect of Tx7335 therefore represents a new mechanism of K+-channel regulation. The main research objective of this project is to understand the basis for the functional effect of Tx7335, and in particular the details of the interaction between channel and toxin and the structural changes that toxin binding induces in the channel. In order to probe the surface of the channel that interacts with the toxin, individual amino acid residues on the external surface of KcsA that may interact with the toxin will be mutated to a different amino acid. If the original amino acid is indeed important in the interaction, then the expectation is that the mutation will lead to a different response of the mutant channel to the toxin. The response will be tested by measuring potassium currents flowing through all mutant channels in artificial bilayers with and without added toxin. A rough mapping of the toxin binding site will be possible in this way. Mutations will also be made on the toxin to identify residues on the surface of the toxin that interact with the channel. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments will be used to obtain higher-resolution structural information of the channel-toxin interactions. This technique allows the characterization of the binding interface and the detection of structural changes upon toxin binding to be performed with atomic resolution. These experiments will eventually allow resolving the three-dimensional toxin-channel complex structure. This knowledge will advance understanding of K+ channel function and regulation, with relevance for a large number of biological processes in animals that are dependent on influx of potassium ions. In addition, this understanding will also be relevant to plant physiology, where highly homologous potassium channels are involved in potassium uptake and transport as well as in the opening and closing of stomata by regulating the turgor pressure of the surrounding guard cells. Lastly, ion channel toxins selective for insect channels may also be very useful as insecticides with reduced negative environmental impact, and better understanding of toxin-channel interactions will be beneficial in guiding the development of such pest control approaches in agriculture.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>     The project will provide an opportunity for the integration of research in education and will contribute to the training of the next generation of students in Staten Island and the greater New York City area with a special emphasis on students who are historically underrepresented in science.  Undergraduate and high-school students participants will be recruited from the College of Staten Island, from LaGuardia Community College (a minority-serving institution), and from high-need local Staten Island high schools. Students will be closely mentored to promote development of their scientific and critical thinking skills and to increase their preparation to succeed in science. An outreach program through the Discovery Institute at the College of Staten Island will involve developing and disseminating teaching modules based on the proposed research suitable for implementation at the high-school level. These programs will be created by interested teachers in collaboration with the PI and Discovery Institute experts, and will be based on analysis of structural data pertaining to the project using molecular visualization software. Students will suggest mutations that would affect toxin binding and upload these to the project web site. Submissions will be functionally tested by the research staff and the final experiments will be streamed back to the high school and archived as video podcasts on the project server. The implementation of these modules will help to create excitement for science and engage students in hypothesis-driven research through media that the students are already familiar with (computer 3D software, webcasts and online video). Lastly, the curriculum for the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course that the PI teaches at the College of Staten Island will also be redesigned as a research-based course drawing from elements of the research project. This exposure to actual research in a mandatory lab course will enrich student's understanding of the nature of science and the design of research. In summary, the research will serve as a vehicle to increase scientific interest, literacy and fluency among involved undergraduate students as well as local high-school teachers and students."

This study will test whether the network of regulators stops the cell cycle and growth until damage from toxic chemicals is repaired.

Recent work of the PI has led to the hypothesis that a novel network of transcription factors in Archaea functions as a checkpoint that regulates the cell cycle in response to damage from stress. This checkpoint may provide flexibility and robustness in response to extreme and variable conditions endemic to the habitats of many Archaea. However, regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle progress are unknown in Archaea, primarily due to the lack of tractable test organisms and live cell assays.

Alterations to these protein removal pathways can cause sterility or a severe reduction in the quantity and quality of seed production.  However, currently little is known about the identity of these short-lived proteins and how they are targeted for removal.  The goal of this research is to understand the functions of a specific group of proteins, termed the F-box proteins, in regulating protein turnover during seed development.  The resulting discoveries can then be translated into crop breeding for developing innovative approaches to manipulate seed production.  The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide a wide array of training opportunties for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including those from groups under-represented in science.  In addition, this project will develop and promote a ""big data"" - enabled educational system through classroom teaching, research mentoring in the laboratory, and outreach programs.  This training system is critical in modern biological education due to the exponential increase in genomic sequencing.  The educational goal of this project is to train diverse students, particularly those from educationally underserved Appalachian areas, to develop computational thinking skills in solving biological questions, thus empowering them to pursue a STEM-based career.<br/><br/>The F-box protein family serves as the substrate receptor in Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases that target many abnormal and short-lived proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome.  In plants, this family plays a wide range of regulatory roles as suggested by its large expansion in plant genomes and genetic analyses of several members in the family.  Unfortunately, little is known about the functions of most F-box proteins.  Given the presence of many conserved cellular differentiation programs that coordinate to form a mature seed, the over-arching goal of this project is to uncover the role of evolutionarily-conserved F-box proteins in seed development, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model.  First, RNA-Seq experiments and proteomic analyses will be undertaken to define the global influence of F-box-mediated protein degradation in seed development.  Bioinformatic approaches will then be used to construct dynamic regulatory networks between active F-box members, F-box substrates, and transcription factors involved in different seed developmental stages.  Second, a novel inducible clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) approach, combined with conventional T-DNA insertion mutations and over-expression strategies, will be used to uncover the genetic functions of conserved F-box genes in embryogenesis.  Third, comprehensive genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches will be utilized to fine tune the mechanistic roles of F-box proteins involved in seed development.  Fourth, the sequencing data generated from the experiments will be adopted in ""big data"" - enabled biological education, in which different levels of computational thinking skills will be incorporated to train a diverse group of students.  This research is anticipated to contribute in-depth knowledge to both seed biology and the biochemistry of protein ubiquitylation.  Innovative materials, methods, and algorithms created in the project will have substantial impacts on furthering the understanding of the role of protein ubiquitylation in gene expression regulation.<br/>The Project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and Integrative Organismal Systems, with additional support provided by the Directorate's Rule of Life Venture Fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells tune the strength and specificity of responses by changing the number of receptors available on the surface, by transporting them to and from compartments inside the cell. Therefore, how receptor transport is regulated is a fundamental question that is critical to understanding how cells respond and adapt to their environment. This project addresses this question by integrating direct visualization of the dynamics of receptor movement in living cells in real time, quantitative modeling, and molecular genetics, to test a mechanistic model for how receptor transport is regulated and how this regulation influences cellular responses. Through its broader impacts, this project offers an opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in using microscopy to address mechanistic questions, and to iteratively integrate microscopy, quantitative data analysis, and modeling to address cell biological questions. Further, to reach a broader community and promote the use of quantitative imaging in education at an early stage, the PI will actively introduce the tools developed and the information obtained to both science-focused and general public forums, including among students and teachers in high schools with underrepresented minorities, and in lifelong learning centers, in the Pittsburgh area.<br/><br/>The endosome serves as the primary sorting station for proteins, including signaling receptors, that are internalized from the cell surface. Of the four main pathways taken by internalized receptors in the endosome, three - bulk recycling, degradation, and trafficking to the Golgi - have been extensively studied, and the mechanisms identified have each defined major new directions in cell biology. This project addresses the fourth and comparatively less studied pathway - sequence-dependent recycling. Many signaling receptors are restricted to this pathway, but how and why are not known. A major hurdle in studying this process has been the lack of direct assays to visualize and analyze receptor sorting in real time. Emerging data indicate that endosomal sorting relies on kinetic principles, further emphasizing this. Therefore, the research goals of this project are to develop and use quantitative live-cell imaging approaches to directly visualize the sorting of B2AR, a member of the largest family of signaling receptors, as a prototype for sequence-dependent recycling, and to integrate the data obtained into quantitative models to test a mechanistic hypothesis for receptor sorting. By using approaches from whole-cell to single-event imaging, the project will test the hypotheses that signaling receptors are actively restricted to sequence-dependent recycling by their interactions with the putative endosomal complex identified, and that these interactions serve as control points for signaling pathways to reprogram receptor trafficking and signaling. The educational goal of this project is to promote quantitative microscopy as a mechanistic tool and train graduate and undergraduate students in methods in quantitative cell biology."

Within genes, dedicated regions called enhancers, consist of a patchwork of short sequences that bind to regulators of gene activity, called transcription factors. It is this binding that determines when, where, and how strongly a gene will express its function. The organization of enhancers is dauntingly complex. Despite four decades of extensive study, many general properties of enhancers remain obscure. For example, it is still nearly impossible to predict enhancer function from the DNA sequence or to construct an artificial DNA enhancer that would turn the gene on in the right kind of a cell in response to a right kind of a signal. This project will specifically address this problem. It will study in detail the composition and organization of an enhancer of a gene in a model organism, roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Its ultimate goal is to engineer an artificial enhancer that could direct gene expression in specific cells in C. elegans. Not only would this serve as a powerful demonstration of the understanding of basic rules of enhancer organization and function, but also be an important step toward designing biological systems with specific performance characteristics. The work on this project will be also used to provide research experience for Chicago-area school teachers, including those that work in schools located at the communities that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate in detail the organization and function of an enhancer of a C. elegans gene. General lack of fine-resolution data (at the level of individual binding sites) for any C. elegans gene, hampers the use of this powerful model organism for understanding enhancer structure/function and computational modeling approaches. The project will start with an experimental dissection of a short enhancer expressed in a small number of neurons. These empirical data will be evaluated against comparative sequence data of orthologous and co-regulated enhancers to infer particularly conserved features of sequence composition and structural organization. Finally, a series of artificial enhancer elements will be generated. They will test specific hypotheses by replacing native enhancer sequences with different synthetic ones that retain basic features inferred to be important from the prior experimental and computational analyses. The aim is to construct a family of enhancers that retain little of the original sequences and yet produce a largely correct expression pattern. This work will advance understanding of enhancer function/organization, inform comparative genomic analyses of regulatory regions, and contribute to design of synthetic genetic circuits in multicellular eukaryotes. In a continuing collaboration with the outreach office of the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology at the University of Systems Biology at the University of Chicago, the project will interact with the area high school teachers, giving them an opportunity for summer research experience and helping to develop teaching modalities that cover modern genetics."

Understanding the relationship between genome and phenotype has implications not just for understanding biology, but for biomanufacturing, and human health.  A key contributor to this gap in knowledge is the lack of understanding of how multiple genetic mutations interact to cause changes in phenotypes.  In this project the investigators will develop and validate a hybrid computational-experimental strategy to efficiently map genetic interaction networks for two types of human cells . The project will result in a new computational approach for selecting which genes to mutate in specific cell types to best understand genetic interactions, and will deploy a genome-wide gene editing pipeline to quantify genetic interactions in the human cell lines. The resulting data will be useful for understanding the basic functions of human genes, many of which still remain uncharacterized.

Many cell signals are required to work together so this process works flawlessly. This project will systematically build a theoretical understanding of a cell signaling pathway in developing fruit fly embryos. Like many genetic pathways required for animal development, this signaling pathway was initially discovered using fruit flies and later shown to be essential for normal human development and health. This project will foster scientific collaborations between the U.S and Israel. Students from biology, engineering, and physics will examine how an external signal is converted into specific outputs using experimental and computational approaches. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained by a multidisciplinary research team that has wide-ranging expertise in laboratory and theoretical methods. Undergraduate students in Biomedical and Computer engineering will gain hands-on laboratory experiences and work with advanced students as a team, to achieve a common goal. This will help them to communicate ideas and results to fellow students and will promote interdisciplinary training.<br/><br/>The central aim of this collaborative research project is to understand how different cell types convert the same cell signaling pathway into distinct responses during animal development. Defining how a signal invokes appropriate cell responses is of fundamental importance because signaling pathways ensure essential cell types are generated throughout an organism's lifespan. The Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila is iteratively used to invoke distinct responses in different cell types throughout animal development. The specific goals of this project are to develop a systematic, quantitative understanding of how the Notch signal is converted into cell-specific outputs using an in vivo synthetic biology approach and mathematical modeling. Drosophila carrying a set of reporters that systematically vary in number and architecture of Notch-regulated DNA binding sites will be created. Quantitative expression analysis and transcription factor occupancy data will be obtained using high resolution imaging of fixed and live tissues. Experimental data will be used to build mathematical models and computational simulations. Models will be based on a statistical mechanics description of transcription to describe how key parameters (DNA binding sites, ratios of effector proteins, binding affinities, and protein degradation) alter Notch output. Predictions from these models will be tested experimentally and will be used to improve the mathematical models. A quantitative description for the core Notch transcription module will provide a framework to systematically explore the role of additional biological factors on Notch-mediated transcription.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation."

The project will study chromosome ends in the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae - a devastating pathogen of rice and wheat plants. Of the more than 20 known genes that control fungus interactions with the host plants, at least 50% are found close to the telomeres. It has long been a puzzle as to how (and why) these genes find their ways to the chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that the M. oryzae chromosome ends undergo rearrangements at spectacularly high frequencies and this can lead to the capture and duplication of internal sequences at the chromosome ends. This, in turn, causes the formerly subtelomeric sequences to be relegated to the chromosome interior. This project will use DNA sequencing and related data analysis methods to test the hypothesis that telomere dynamics is a major driver of chromosome evolution. This project largely involves DNA sequencing and associated data analysis techniques (bioinformatics). Individuals with the relevant cross-training in biology and computer science are rare and collaborations between individuals from the two domains are challenged by differences in their training and skills. Recognizing a national need for individuals with dual domain expertise, most of the objectives for this project will be completed through research experiences for teams of biology and computer science undergraduates from the partner institutions of the Univ. of Kentucky, Northern Kentucky Univ., Eastern Kentucky Univ. and Western Kentucky Univ., with specific efforts being made to enhance participation for student populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM research.<br/><br/>Despite intense interest in telomere biology and the importance of the associated chromosome regions (subtelomeres) in cellular biology, organismal adaptation and evolution, the organization of chromosome ends and their dynamics is poorly understood due to poor representation in genome assemblies. The central hypothesis driving this project is that the telomere regions are the main factories of fungal genome evolution, whereby recurrent bouts of telomere crisis provide the fuel for raw materials recruitment and telomere rescue pathways act to generate novel sequences. It has long been proposed that fungal genomes might evolve through such ""Adaptive Telomere Failure"" (ATF) but, until now, no examples had been identified. This project will greatly expand knowledge on fungal genome structure and reveal the full impact of ATF on genome organization and evolution. Additionally, it is suspected that enhanced rates of nucleotide substitution/indel polymorphism in the subtelomeric regions may further accelerate the neo-functionalization of terminally captured sequences. This project will test a number of predictions related to these hypotheses, while seeking to gain an improved understanding of subtelomere-internal genome sequence exchange, as it relates to fungal genome structure and host adaptation. Specific objectives include: 1. Generate end-to-end genome assemblies for the main host-specialized forms of M. oryzae and characterize the structural and genic diversity of the subterminal chromosome regions. 2. Assess the impact of telomere dynamics on M. oryzae genome evolution by identifying and characterizing internalized relics of former telomeres; 3. Examine genome reorganization following spontaneous or experimentally-induced telomere crisis events; and 4. Accomplish project objectives through ""bite-sized"" undergraduate research projects that foster collaboration between biologists and computer scientists."

Just as human traits, such as height or eye color, are transmitted from parents to their offspring, cells can also show observable patterns of inheritance. The specific goal of this project is to understand how a cell's inherited traits affect its future behavior; for example, whether it will stop dividing or become a more specialized type of cell. As such, this work addresses a fundamental, unanswered question in biology that could impact multiple disciplines across the life sciences. The research goals are deeply integrated with community outreach activities designed to educate and engage a diverse group of students including underrepresented minorities. The project will produce an online game in which students from an urban elementary school will create 'family trees' for cells by tracing images of cells over time. Students will earn points for each successfully tracked cell while learning the basic principles of cell biology. In addition, the investigator will host an open competition in which local high-school students compete to develop the most accurate models of cell behavior using data sets produced by the project. Thus, this project addresses a fundamental problem in cell biology and provides opportunities both to teach underrepresented groups and to draw on their emerging interest in, and talent for, science.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis of this study is that, in addition to environmental cues, an individual cell's fate is strongly influenced by the sequence of events that occurred both within that cell's own lifetime as well as during the lifetimes of its ancestor cells. This hypothesis will be pursued by developing a computational model of single-cell lifetimes and lineage relationships and applying these models to understand, in quantitative terms, how a cell's individual and family history influences its fate decisions. The project will employ fluorescence time-lapse microscopy to quantify inheritance patterns across thousands of related cells spanning multiple cellular generations. Cells will be challenged with environmental stresses or developmental signals and the fates of individual cells and their offspring will be determined. With these data in hand, mathematical models will be used to: (i) understand how the lifetimes of individual cells are regulated; (ii) quantify how single-cell traits are inherited; and (iii) determine how molecular events in a cell's history determine its fate. The project focuses on the inheritance patterns of two single-cell traits: DNA double-stranded breaks (that generally slow progression through the cell cycle); and expression of a canonical pluripotency factor, OCT4 (that generally inhibits differentiation of cells and keeps them in a pluripotent state). Quantitative predictions will be validated through targeted experimental perturbations. Successful completion of the work will lead to the development of a new theoretical framework for understanding how critical events occurring throughout a cell's history shape its functional responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins can often become damaged and lose their correct 3D structures thus making them more prone to aggregation and the formation of toxic aggregates.  Misfolded protein aggregation is a fundamental problem that all cells encounter, either randomly due to errors in protein synthesis or as a stress-induced phenomenon caused by exposure of proteins to damaging agents. To counteract misfolded protein aggregation, eukaryotic cells have evolved robust organelle-specific protein quality control (PQC) pathways that manage these proteins. This project seeks to examine the mechanisms of targeting of misfolded and aggregated proteins to different PQC pathways in the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), using high throughput screening and computational analysis.  It will also reveal the key features of misfolded protein toxicity in the nucleus.  More broadly, the research will provide numerous training opportunities for scientists at all levels of experience, from high school and undergraduate students to graduate students and research scientists. Publically available datasets will be created from the data generated. International workshops will also be created to provide a global means for education and information dissemination. <br/><br/>The focus of this research is to understand how the nuclear organelle in eukaryotic cells protects itself from proteins that have become incorrectly folded and form toxic aggregates by examining the mechanisms of targeting misfolded proteins through the multiple ubiquitin-proteasome system protein quality control (UPS PQC) pathways. The experimental system is designed to maximize the probability of identifying the spectrum of degradation signals that govern the UPS PQC degradation pathways in the nucleus. To this end, a library of yeast cDNA fragments will be constructed and appended to a nuclear reporter system. The resulting nuclear protein library will enable measurement of the contribution of each individual fragment to protein stability. Specifically, to sort the different UPS PQC pathways in the nucleus, the reporter library will be expressed in yeast strains with single or combined deletions of specific nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligases. Data analysis will rely on in-depth bioinformatics that will correlate the destabilizing elements with their affecting pathway(s). Subsequently, the destabilizing sequences (degrons) will be compared to sequences identified by a complementary yeast 2-hybrid analysis as interaction sequences of nuclear proteins with their cognate ubiquitin ligases. Once degrons are classified by their cognate degradation pathways, further computational analyses will discern structural features particularly degron sequence, structure, biochemical and biophysical properties. Distinct features will be tested experimentally. To better understand the relationship between a tendency of a degron to aggregate and its contribution to cell toxicity, a combination of cell-growth and fluorescent assays will be employed. Altogether, the identification of novel UPS PQC degrons will enable systematic investigation of misfolded protein quality control in the nucleus. This, in turn, will provide new biological hypotheses about how misfolded proteins aggregates and its consequences.<br/> <br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation."

The looming threats to food security demand transformative innovations in agriculture that will drive the second green revolution. Maize is the most economically important crop in the U.S providing food, feed and bioenergy to the global economy. It is also one of the most photosynthetically productive plants on the planet. This productivity is driven by biochemical and anatomical adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis. One proposed grand challenge is to introduce C4 traits into C3 crops such as rice and many temperate grasses. A major conceptual breakthrough in the understanding of the development of C4 photosynthesis was realized through the discovery that a root endodermal cell fate module was co-opted to drive a leaf specific cellular differentiation program. Importantly, a prediction from this model suggests that a limited number of changes in genes could lead to a major reprogramming of leaf cell fates.  This project will test this prediction and expand on our understanding of the gene regulatory networks that drive both biochemical and anatomical innovations associated with C4 photosynthesis. The results of these studies will not only provide candidate genes for engineering C4 traits into C3 crops, but also provide novel targets for improvement of existing C4 crops such as maize, sugarcane and sorghum. With regard to training and outreach, the project will continue to expand on the MutantMillets outreach program at the DDPSC. MutantMillets provides teaching modules and teaching resources with hands-on activities in the plant sciences to engage high school students in the St. Louis metropolitan region. Importantly, all resources developed through this program will be portable to other school systems through the project website and through the educational networks established by the Education and Outreach Center at the DDPSC.<br/> <br/><br/>Grasses that utilize C4 photosynthesis include maize, sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus.  C4 grasses use two distinct cell types to create a CO2 pump that elevates the levels of CO2 in the vicinity of the enzyme Rubisco, effectively eliminating wasteful photorespiration. Under hot, dry conditions C4 systems display significantly increased productivity relative to C3 crops such as rice and wheat. This project aims to identify the foundational genetic and regulatory networks that control the differentiation of the two photosynthetic cell types in maize - the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M). This work expands on recent discoveries that has linked the SHR/SCR/IDD regulatory module to the differentiation of the BS and M cells of maize and provides new opportunities to more fully explore the function of this regulatory network in C4 grasses through an integrated systems biology approach. These studies will include the development and implementation of several emerging technologies including cell-type specific proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies, robotics-based yeast one hybrid screens, ChIP-seq, translatomics, X-ray computed tomography, novel informatics/network analysis algorithms, and modeling of both developmental phenotypes and mechanistic regulatory networks.

Therefore, understanding how plants sense, take up and re-distribute iron in edible tissues is essential. Traditionally, iron sensing by plants was believed to occur exclusively by roots that are in close contact with iron sources in the soil, however, provocative preliminary data from our laboratories and others suggests that plants rapidly sense changes in iron concentrations in specialized cells located in leaves, termed companion cells. This project will focus on the early events of iron deficiency responses in plants and on the communication between leaves and roots to adapt when iron becomes scarce. In addition, this project will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students on cutting-edge molecular biology techniques, particularly techniques that address changes in specific tissues such as the veins of plants, which have been shown to play an important role in leaf-to-root communication. Moreover, this project will emphasize collaborative work between students from different disciplines including computer sciences, biochemistry and plant sciences. Learning how to communicate across disciplines is critical for developing novel techniques and instrumentation to study in detail how plants respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability. In the long-term, students capable of understanding and bridging different disciplines will be well-equipped for the current competitive job market in academia and industry.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is the identification of molecular mechanisms mediating iron (Fe) sensing and homeostasis in plants. Respiration and photosynthesis heavily depend on the redox properties of iron to generate and store energy; however, this reactivity makes iron extremely toxic at high concentrations. Therefore, plants need to sense the levels of Fe within tissues and regulate Fe uptake to prevent overload and cellular damage. Despite significant advances in identifying molecular components of the Fe deficiency response in plants, the sensing and precise location of Fe sensing in plants remains unknown. More recently, it has been found that specific cells within the leaf vasculature (companion cells) are capable of sensing changes in iron availability more rapidly than roots. This project will use a cross-disciplinary approach to address the long-standing question about the spatial (where) and temporal (when) responses to iron deficiency in plants by identifying and integrating transcriptional and protein networks at cell-specific resolution. Several techniques, such as proximity labeling, have been specifically adapted to plants to pursue proteomic studies in specific tissues. Cell-specific translatome analyses during early stages of iron deficiency will be used to define the primary (early) and secondary (responses) to iron limitation in the vasculature and will guide high-throughput protein-DNA binding experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms driving early responses to Fe deficiency in companion cells. Experimental approaches will be complemented with modeling and simulation to produce an integrated view of plant responses to changes in iron availability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will take advantage of cutting-edge molecular biophysics approaches to probe key differences in the organization of centromeres, relative to other parts of chromosomes. Scientific and technological advances will be integrated into hands-on research training for undergraduate and graduate students and will be incorporated into a formal course of study in structural biology and biophysics. Application of state-of-the art technology to central questions in chromosome biology is expected not only to inspire student interest in basic science, but also to prepare them for careers at the interface of biology and physics. <br/><br/>In eukaryotic cells, accurate segregation of replicated chromosomes during cell division is mediated by centromeres.  If centromeres become damaged or removed, chromosomes segregate randomly, thus disrupting the cell division process. Centromeres differ from the rest of the chromosomes by containing nucleosomes (DNA-protein building blocks of higher-order chromatin) in which the typical protein histone H3 has been replaced by a related histone known as CENP-A. This replacement is presumed to confer new structural organization to the centromere, thereby enabling it to be recognized by the segregation machinery. However, details about the structure and the mechanism underlying the highly specific recognition remain uncertain. The studies in this project are designed to advance knowledge of centromere chromatin structure at all levels of its organization and especially to understand what structural features distinguish centromeres from non-centromeric regions of chromosomes. High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies will be used to assess the structure of centromere chromatin at different levels of organization. Single nucleosomes and nucleosome arrays will be visualized directly with the use of cutting-edge high-speed AFM, enabling dynamic imaging in aqueous solution at nanoscale with video-rate temporal resolution. The experimental data will be supplemented by high-power computational analysis. This combined approach will shed new light on the structure and dynamics of centromere nucleosomes and nucleosome arrays and will lead to understanding the relationship between centromere structure and its function during the chromosomal segregation process.  <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Emerging Frontiers Division, both in the Biological Sciences Directorate, and by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

A predictive understanding of living systems is a prerequisite for designed manipulation in bioengineering and informed intervention in medicine. Such an understanding requires quantitative measurements, mathematical analysis, and theoretical abstraction. The advent of powerful measurement technologies and computing capacity has positioned biology to drive the next scientific revolution. Synthetic Biology provides a natural platform for the development and testing of models and general network principles using quantitative data from engineered genetic circuits. One of the major fundamental problems of Synthetic Biology is the propensity of synthetic circuits to evolve and obliterate their intended functionality. Thus, it is important to develop a quantitative approach to make genetic networks more robust and stable which also will make them more useful in therapeutic applications. The overall goal of this project to explore the challenges and exploit the opportunities that accompany the inevitable selective pressure that arises in synthetic biology through a combination of cutting-edge experimental and computational tools. Successful accomplishment of this project will lead to significant advances in understanding the interaction between synthetic circuits and host genome in the evolutionary context.  This project will provide ample opportunities for cross-disciplinary training of the new generation of quantitative biologists. Furthermore, to broaden the impact of this project beyond academia, its participants will expand a highly successful elementary school science program that that foster collaboration between researchers and teachers at partner elementary schools to improve hands-on science education.<br/><br/>To reach the overall goal of the project, the recently developed ""synchronized lysis circuit"" will be used as the major focus. This synthetic gene circuit functions by triggering death of around 90% of the bacteria at a threshold population density, leaving the remaining 10% of the cells to grow back to threshold and restart the cycle. This generates a distinct phenotype characterized by population cycling that can be monitored across a wide range of length scales using micro- and bench-top chemostats. It also introduces a strong selective pressure that can lead to rapid evolution. The investigators will develop quantitative measurement technology and computational modeling that will lead to a quantitative statistical characterization of the circuit-host evolution process. Sequencing of the circuit and mutated sections of the host genome along the time course of the experiments will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary path the systems have taken. Mathematical modeling will guide experiments and help extract key parameters characterizing evolutionary dynamics of the synchronized lysis circuit. Using the gained knowledge, the researchers will engineer a ""lysis circuit stabilizer"" module that kills mutant bacteria losing lysis efficiency, and explore ways to use lysis circuit as a tool in directed evolution of synthetic circuits.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology (SSB) program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (BBE) program of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) in the Engineering Directorate."

In most plants, chloroplast engineering is very inefficient.  However, a recent breakthrough has revealed the genetic bottleneck for this process, and this project will leverage the new information to develop methods for efficient engineering of chloroplasts in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  The experimental design will be directly applicable to crops in the evolutionary related Brassicaceae family, broccoli, an important vegetable, and oilseed rape, an important source of edible oil.  The ability to engineer chloroplasts in these crops could lead to significant production improvements. The project will also have educational impact by providing research training for undergraduates, including women and underrepresented minorities. Undergraduates will be recruited from Rutgers University through The Douglass Project for Rutgers Women in Math, Science and Engineering, and The Rutgers Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates. Under-represented minorities, low-income, and first-generation college students will also be recruited from the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program or the First in the World Grant programs at Farmingdale State College, Farmingdale, NY. A summer research experience in chloroplast biotechnology will be offered to an undergraduate student from the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Brazil as part of a plan to recruit students for the joint Rutgers/USP PhD program. <br/><br/>Transformation of the plastid genome is routine in tobacco, but 100-fold less frequent in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, preventing its widespread use for studying questions in plastid biology. Recent data have revealed that plastid transformation efficiency is 100-fold enhanced in Arabidopsis plants with a defective ACC2 gene. This mutant line is hypersensitive to spectinomycin, the selective agent used for plastid transformation. Proof of principle for increased plastid transformation frequency was obtained in the Columbia background, because ACC2 T-DNA knockout lines are available in this accession. However, the Columbia accession is recalcitrant to plant regeneration from cultured cells where plastid transformation is carried out. The goal of this research is to provide Arabidopsis plastid transformation research tools for the plant community. This will be achieved through (1) obtaining ACC2 knockout lines in the regenerable RLD and Ws accessions; (2) developing plant regeneration protocols from transplastomic cells to obtain fertile transplastomic plants; (3) obtaining regenerable forms of the Columbia ecotype; and (4) constructing plastid transformation vectors that are suitable to achieve these goals. The results will accelerate studies of plastid function, thereby allowing better understanding of the 'rules' that govern interactions between this important organelle and the nucleus and contribute to essential plastid functions.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems; both programs are in the Directorate for Biological Sciences."

To guard against this mutagenic outcome, cells have evolved mechanisms to interfere with transposable element mobilization. Previous work established a role for small RNAs in transposable element inhibition. This project will use modern genomics-enabled approaches in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to conduct a 'severe test' of the assumptions and conclusions that led to the prevailing mechanistic view and to expand understanding of how transposable element silencing is triggered.  Because transposable elements are widespread in the genomes of both plants and animals, the results are expected to have broad impact in the field of regulatory biology. The project will also have strong educational impact, as it emphasizes data reproducibility and scientific ethics in three contexts: curricular enrichment for undergraduates who will integrate the research in their laboratory courses; annual outreach workshops for 7th grade minority students focused on science, technology, engineering and mathematics; and direct participation in research by early-career scientists at postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels.  <br/><br/>The mobility and mutagenic potential of transposable elements depends on mRNAs produced by synthesis of RNAs (transcription) from the elements themselves. This transcription step is a key control point for regulating transposable element mobility. Previous work has shown that transcription of transposable elements is turned off by small RNAs, which initiate silencing by a post-transcriptional interference mechanism that transitions to transcriptional-level silencing. This project will reproduce key aspects of that previous work and will apply modern technological capabilities to produce higher-value datasets that will be analyzed in creative and innovative ways to determine precisely how RNA interference is targeted to a particular transcript and how RNA-directed DNA methylation and transcriptional-level repression are established to produce trans-generational epigenetic silencing of transposable elements. Data and protocols will be broadly disseminated via open-access routes to enable the reproducibility of the research. The results should provide not only new understanding of how RNA-mediated silencing occurs, but also clues about how such silencing could be prevented. These insights could have practical consequences for genetically engineering plants with agronomic benefit."

Stomata are small openings in the surfaces of plants that regulate the photosynthetic conversion of CO2 into plant biomass, which serves as a renewable source of food, materials, and bioenergy. A deeper understanding of cell wall structure, mechanics, and dynamics in stomatal guard cells will help identify plants that can more efficiently use water, a major limiting factor in global agricultural production. The computational image analysis and modeling tools that will be developed in this project will provide scientists with new ways of interpreting and understanding experimental data. Because stomatal guard cells are an amazing example of cellular engineering by plants and are accessible and observable by scientists of all ages, a learning module will be developed and deployed that allows 4th through 8th graders to observe stomatal dynamics first-hand and challenges them to construct and optimize functioning macro-scale models of stomatal guard cells, helping to inspire future scientists and engineers. This project will also train two PhD students and a research associate in interdisciplinary research skills that cross the boundaries of biology, computer and information science, and engineering.<br/><br/>In plants, stomatal guard cells function as dynamic gatekeepers that control CO2 and water flux to maintain homeostasis. To control transpiration and photosynthesis, stomatal development, morphology, and mechanics are tightly regulated. However, two large gaps exist in our knowledge of how stomata develop and function. First, stomatal pores form via controlled separation of sister guard cells, but how this is accomplished is unknown. Second, the walls of guard cells must be highly flexible to enable repeated stomatal opening and closing, but strong enough to withstand the enormous turgor pressure that drives their deformation. How guard cell walls are molecularly constructed to meet these competing requirements remains largely undefined. This project will analyze the molecular and mechanical requirements for stomatal pore formation, and the dynamic molecular architecture of guard cell walls that underlie their unique mechanical properties, using a complementary set of approaches including molecular genetics, high-resolution microscopy, and computational image analysis. The data and insights gained from these analyses will be used to construct computational mechanical models of guard cell walls that can be iteratively refined with new experimental results, ultimately resulting in the ability to predict guard cell dynamics across a range of species, wall compositions, and signaling inputs."

The search for this set led to the construction of the minimal bacterial cell JCVI-syn3A. With 493 genes in a genome of 543 kbp, JCVI-syn3A has a genome smaller than that of any independently-replicating cell found in nature, a robust morphology, and can divide every two hours in a stress-free laboratory growth medium. Nearly all genes in this minimal cell are essential, and the cell is small enough that a complete description of all cellular functions can be attempted over biological relevant length, time, and concentrations scales by exploiting graphics processing unit (GPU) computing.  Recent successes in GPU computing, and 3D imaging have made it now possible to build a whole-cell computational model of this minimal bacterial cell and to investigate what are the physical rules of life.  In this project the investigators will study hitherto uncharacterized genes in the minimal cell whose functions have not been identified, and use this information to construct a whole-cell computational model encompassing all cellular functions.  The outcome of this project will allow the research team to predict cellular behavior under a variety of perturbations, and thus explain how a complete cell works.  The educational broader impacts include the training of students and postdoctoral investigators, and outreach to the broader community through workshops and YouTube/VR platforms facilitating the public dissemination of the science<br/><br/>This project aims to comprehensively characterize the minimal bacterial cell JCVI-syn3A through multimodal experiments, and to integrate the heterogeneous data into a multi-scale, predictive whole-cell computational model of the minimal cell using novel simulation methods developed during this project. In particular, the principal investigators have proposed two major aims. Major aim 1: Characterization of the minimal cell and its cellular networks. 1a: The PIs will probe the function of the remaining genes of unknown, but essential function (as determined by transposon insertion experiments) using  CRISPRi-based expression modulation and study the corresponding change in cellular phenotype. 1b: Investigators will refine and expand the existing metabolic model for JCVI-syn3A by developing a defined growth medium as a basis for all subsequent experiments; studying various aspects of cellular composition and functionality; and expanding the steady-state metabolic model to a kinetic model. 1c: Visual proteomics of JCVI-syn3A cells will be obtained using cryo-electron tomography (CET) to extract cell-wide abundance and spatial distribution of large macromolecular complexes. Major aim 2: Researchers will integrate the heterogeneous experimental data into a whole-cell computational model using the GPU-based Lattice Microbes software that can treat the spatially heterogeneous environment of the cell. 2a: The team will engage in methodological development of hybrid methods that will allow handling of species with vastly different concentration ranges and dynamic behavior. To bridge these scales, investigators will develop hybrid stochastic-deterministic methodologies that couple Reaction Diffusion Master Equations (RDME) with Brownian dynamics (BD)  and ordinary differential equation (ODE) descriptions of cellular components. 2b: They will integrate the metabolic network with models of ribosome assembly, transcription, translation, mRNA/protein decay, DNA replication, cell growth and division. 2c.

A key aspect of many cytoskeletal polymers is that they require chemical energy in the form of ATP (or GTP) to maintain a polymerized state. The harnessing of this energy allows the cytoskeletal filaments to do work, respond dynamically to internal and external signals, and self-organize. The major goal of the work in this project is to use a combination of experiments and computational modeling to develop an improved theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviors of these dynamic cytoskeletal polymers as observed at different scales. More specifically, the proposed work sets out to establish how the biochemical properties of the polymer subunits (including the rate at which they burn ATP or GTP) relate to the behaviors of the individual filaments and to the overall behaviors of populations of filaments. In addition, the project studies how filament binding proteins work together to regulate filament dynamics. While this work is basic science, it has the potential to have practical applications in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. Through this project, graduate students and undergraduates will receive interdisciplinary training in both computational modeling and experimental biology. High school teachers and students will also be engaged in the research process. Freely available, open-source software and tutorials produced through this project will help students and researchers at all levels gain an intuitive understanding of dynamic polymer systems. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the project has four specific goals, most of which focus on a type of cytoskeletal filaments known as microtubules. Individual microtubules exhibit a dramatic behavior known as dynamic instability, in which they stochastically alternate between extended periods of growth and depolymerization. (1) The first project goal is to develop and test hypotheses for the mechanisms of the transitions in microtubule dynamic instability by relating the behaviors of the filaments to the subunit-level structure of their tips. The approach will utilize a combination of work with a previously established detailed computational model of microtubule dynamics, a novel data analysis tool for identifying and statistically categorizing the microtubule behaviors, and experimental data acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions. (2) The second goal is to establish a predictive understanding of the relationships between the biochemical characteristics of the subunits (kinetic rate constants), the behaviors of the filaments (e.g., dynamic instability, treadmilling) and the attributes of the polymer systems (e.g., critical concentrations, steady states). The approach will utilize a combination of computational modeling (performed with variants of the model used in Goal 1) and experiments with a bacterial relative of tubulin called PhuZ (chosen because wildtype and altered versions of this protein can be expressed in bacteria and characterized in vitro). (3) The third goal is to use a combination of experiments and computational models to test a set of hypotheses for how a group of filament binding proteins known as +TIPs (microtubule plus-end tracking proteins) work together to regulate microtubule behavior. (4) The final goal is to create for broad distribution packages of our software and associated analysis tools used in Goals 1 to 3. These packages will include software targeted at both the research and teaching communities. While the focus of our studies is on microtubules, the resulting multi-scale understanding of polymerizing filament systems should apply to steady-state (energy-utilizing) polymers more generally, including actin, bacterial filaments, and polymers created through biotechnology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information will be used to develop experimental and theoretical approaches suitable for understanding this network.  These computer models have the advantage of allowing rapid exploration of the plant's immune system response under various conditions which are not practical to investigate by actual biological experimentation.  In this project post-doctoral researchers and graduate students will obtain interdisciplinary training in systems biology and computer modeling.

The network is under constant attack by diverse pathogens that evolve much faster than plants. A plant, unlike an animal, does not have an adaptive immune system, and it must rely on the emergent network properties of its immune signaling network to successfully defend itself. In this project, computer models of the pathogen-triggered immune signaling network will be expanded to facilitate identification of emergent properties of the immune system.  Modeling capabilities will be expanded on two fronts. In Aim 1 a fully dynamic differential equation-based model of pathogen triggered immunity will be built and tested. This model will be used for large-scale in silico experiments to identify potential immune engineering targets. In Aim 2 the pathogen triggered immunity model will be extended to explain spatially heterogeneous situations, which commonly occur in nature. To support this modeling effort, data will be collected from leaves with spatial genetic variation generated by laser heat-inducible recombination.  The model will be used to predict cell-to-cell signal flows, such as those mediated by the diffusible primary immune hormones salicylate and jasmonate, and the model predictions will be experimentally tested.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and Symbiosis, Defense and Self-Recognition (Division of Integrative Organismal Systems)."

However, mechanisms that protect the genome generally limit genome modifications to small changes in DNA sequence. Given this paradox, how do organisms adapt to new conditions?  One way to study this question is with prions.  Prion proteins adopt multiple conformations (or shapes), and these unusual and diverse conformations drive a paradigm-shifting mode of inheritance that is based on changes in protein shape rather than changes in DNA sequence. Although best known as the cause of mad cow disease, the majority of the nearly two-dozen prions that have now been identified are benign or beneficial. One such prion, termed [GAR+], controls a fundamental decision in metabolism: whether to harvest energy by breaking down glucose in the absence of oxygen (fermentation) or to harvest energy through the breakdown of glucose (or other organic substrates)in the presence of oxygen (respiration).  This metabolic switch between fermentation and respiration has been associated with a diverse array of disease states.  It was recently discovered that many bacteria secrete small molecules that induce the [GAR+] prion in neighboring eukaryotic cells. Mathematical modeling suggests that both organisms derive benefit from this interaction in some circumstances. However, this interaction can disrupt industrially important fermentation processes and may be harmful to human health. The recent recognition that the microorganisms associated with an organism are often correlated with certain disease states suggests that lessons we learn from better understanding the interactions between prion proteins and bacteria will have broad significance.  Therefore, this project will characterize the interactions between bacteria and yeast that result in prion acquisition, and work to identify the compound(s) produced by bacteria that induces the prion.  The experimental methods and data analysis approaches developed will be useful for studying a variety of systems, and the results will be transmitted to the public through peer-reviewed publications and training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Undergraduate and high school students and teachers will be introduced to the scientific process and will be taught how to design experiments in quantitative cell and molecular biology.  High school students will be recruited for a ""boot camp"" style course that will include developing teaching modules, training of K-12 science teachers, and working with Stanford University's Center for Teaching and Learning.  Undergraduate students will be recruited for the project from existing programs that focus on students from underrepresented backgrounds (including Stanford Amgen-SSRP Scholars Program).  A two-week ""Methods and Logic in Chemical and Systems Biology Boot Camp"" for incoming graduate students will be developed which will teach inquiry-based learning and directly integrate concepts and experiments from the project.<br/><br/><br/>Adaptation to changing environments requires the rapid acquisition of new heritable traits, generally ascribed to mutations. However, epigenetic mechanisms can also generate phenotypic diversity among genetically identical cells. Among these mechanisms, self-perpetuating protein conformations, known as prions, are emerging as an important means of generating phenotypic diversity that is heritable from one generation to the next. Recent studies suggest that these elements are common in wild fungi, where they often confer adaptive traits.  An ancient biological circuit in fungi and many other eukaryotes normally prevents the use of other carbon sources when glucose is present. The [GAR+] prion reverses yeast's strong glucose repression. Although organisms have largely been studied in isolation, in the wild they compete and cooperate in complex communities, and it was recently discovered that bacteria can secrete a chemical factor that elicits the [GAR+] appearance. This induction can provide strong benefits to yeast and bacteria alike. Bacteria benefit because [GAR+] yeast produce less ethanol, creating a less toxic environment. [GAR+] yeast benefit from enhanced growth on mixed carbon sources and greater longevity. Four specific aims will investigate this novel interspecies interaction and the ensuing heritable shift in metabolism: 1) Identify and characterize genes that control interspecies communication, 2) Identify the bacterial signal that induces the [GAR+] prion, 3) Investigate how [GAR+] influences cooperation and cheating in mixed populations, and 4) Characterize mechanisms that drive the [GAR+] metabolic switch using systems-level approaches.  Although dozens of prions have been discovered in the past decade, we lack understanding of their physiological consequences and of factors that regulate their acquisition and loss. This research will employ novel methods to dramatically enhance our understanding of what is emerging as a conserved and fundamental biological process. The experimental methodology and data analysis platforms developed will be useful for studying a variety of systems, and will lead to new insights into how a prion can heritably transform one of the most fundamental decisions in metabolism, and in particular how such regulatory decisions can be fueled by cross-kingdom chemical communication."

A key aspect of many cytoskeletal polymers is that they require chemical energy in the form of ATP (or GTP) to maintain a polymerized state. The harnessing of this energy allows the cytoskeletal filaments to do work, respond dynamically to internal and external signals, and self-organize. The major goal of the work in this project is to use a combination of experiments and computational modeling to develop an improved theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviors of these dynamic cytoskeletal polymers as observed at different scales. More specifically, the proposed work sets out to establish how the biochemical properties of the polymer subunits (including the rate at which they burn ATP or GTP) relate to the behaviors of the individual filaments and to the overall behaviors of populations of filaments. In addition, the project studies how filament binding proteins work together to regulate filament dynamics. While this work is basic science, it has the potential to have practical applications in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. Through this project, graduate students and undergraduates will receive interdisciplinary training in both computational modeling and experimental biology. High school teachers and students will also be engaged in the research process. Freely available, open-source software and tutorials produced through this project will help students and researchers at all levels gain an intuitive understanding of dynamic polymer systems.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the project has four specific goals, most of which focus on a type of cytoskeletal filaments known as microtubules. Individual microtubules exhibit a dramatic behavior known as dynamic instability, in which they stochastically alternate between extended periods of growth and depolymerization. (1) The first project goal is to develop and test hypotheses for the mechanisms of the transitions in microtubule dynamic instability by relating the behaviors of the filaments to the subunit-level structure of their tips. The approach will utilize a combination of work with a previously established detailed computational model of microtubule dynamics, a novel data analysis tool for identifying and statistically categorizing the microtubule behaviors, and experimental data acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions. (2) The second goal is to establish a predictive understanding of the relationships between the biochemical characteristics of the subunits (kinetic rate constants), the behaviors of the filaments (e.g., dynamic instability, treadmilling) and the attributes of the polymer systems (e.g., critical concentrations, steady states). The approach will utilize a combination of computational modeling (performed with variants of the model used in Goal 1) and experiments with a bacterial relative of tubulin called PhuZ (chosen because wildtype and altered versions of this protein can be expressed in bacteria and characterized in vitro). (3) The third goal is to use a combination of experiments and computational models to test a set of hypotheses for how a group of filament binding proteins known as +TIPs (microtubule plus-end tracking proteins) work together to regulate microtubule behavior. (4) The final goal is to create for broad distribution packages of our software and associated analysis tools used in Goals 1 to 3. These packages will include software targeted at both the research and teaching communities. While the focus of our studies is on microtubules, the resulting multi-scale understanding of polymerizing filament systems should apply to steady-state (energy-utilizing) polymers more generally, including actin, bacterial filaments, and polymers created through biotechnology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these organisms reside in salt saturated lakes and ponds that are low in nutrients and limited for oxygen. These ""halophiles"", members of the domain Archaea, can teach us about the origins of energy metabolism since they exploit a wide array of metabolic strategies to survive on the same pool of scarce resources. These halophiles naturally synthesize unique chemicals, such as those resembling jet fuel and biodegradable plastic. Large gaps in knowledge regarding halophile metabolic functions have prevented the use of halophiles for alternative energy solutions. This project will fill these gaps by generating and comparing computational models of energy production pathways across 80 species of halophiles. Empirical measurements of metabolic products from two test species will be used to refine the model predictions. Each year, the PI's research group will teach two weeklong science immersion workshops, one for high school students and the other for undergraduates at University of Puerto Rico. In both workshops, students will measure and model halophile viability during extreme stress. This research will provide fundamental knowledge regarding the evolution of energy production, enable future alternative energy strategies, and engage a diverse population of students in STEM fields early in their careers.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to increase fundamental knowledge regarding how metabolic pathways of archaeal microorganisms are regulated in response to varying nutrients in the environment. Hypersaline-adapted Archaea, or halophiles, provide a unique model for investigating the co-evolution of the transcription regulatory and metabolic networks. Member species share a common hypersaline habitat, but exhibit extensive diversity in how they generate energy. Nutrients are intermittently available in hypersaline lakes during seasonal variations. In response, halophiles have acquired a wide array of possible metabolic solutions to survive on the same pool of scarce resources. Recent transcriptomic and metabolomics evidence from the PI's lab suggest that halophiles use transcriptional regulation as a primary mechanism to tune the metabolic network dynamically in response to nutrient fluctuations. Based on this evidence, the working hypothesis is that the regulatory network co-evolves with the metabolic network in diverse ways during nutrient fluctuation. However, to date, archaeal metabolic diversity has been largely unexplored due to the scarcity of tractable model organisms. Recently, 80 genome sequences of halophiles have become available, a scale that is unprecedented among Archaea. Using these genomic sequence data, the following objectives will be carried out to test the central hypothesis: (a) Construct and compare metabolic network models for 80 species of halophiles using automated computational methods; (b) Test model predictions regarding nutrient and genetic perturbations in two closely related, genetically tractable halophile model species; (c) Refine metabolic models using transcriptome and metabolome data as additional constraints."

It is required to generate most of the chemical energy in our bodies. Iron-bound enzymes catalyze hundreds of reactions in cells, including processes as fundamental as DNA replication and repair. In this project, the principal investigator's aim is to develop mathematical models that simulate the movement of iron in eukaryotic cells and to investigate how that iron is regulated by cells. Like cars driving into a city at rush-hour, iron ""traffic"" occurs on different pathways in the main cytosol region of the cell, and different iron species end up at different locations in the cell such as in mitochondria, the nucleus, or other organelles. The cell regulates these traffic patterns so it can survive and prosper under various environmental situations (too much iron or too little iron). However, the details of this regulation - at the level of molecules - are poorly understood. In this project, the investigator's main objective is to develop a comprehensive math model that accounts for all of the iron-containing species in the cell that will help explain complex iron ""traffic"" within cells. As part of the broader impacts of the project, the PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in science, in interdisciplinary research training.  The PI will also develop a website offering free downloads, sample data and video tutorials related to the project. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to develop molecular-level mechanistically-based math models of iron trafficking and regulation that can simulate the comprehensive iron content and iron-based reactivity of a yeast cell. The PI will construct a model that accounts for iron in the cytosol, mitochondria, vacuoles, ER/Golgi, nuclei, and cell wall. The ordinary-differential-equations-based models will reflect all of the ca. 120 iron-containing species in yeast cells, with species being represented as groups of aggregated components. Models will share ""housekeeping"" processes but each model will have a unique emphasis that will be expanded in detail. In developing the models, the investigator will focus on: a) respiration and reactive oxygen species; b) cytosolic iron metabolism (involving the cytosolic iron sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) and iron-related chemistry in the nucleus; c) mitochondrial iron-sulfur and heme chemistry; d) nutrient iron import and metabolism; e) iron homeostasis and regulation. Each model will be optimized in terms of kinetic parameters against experimental data obtained in the PI's lab or elsewhere. Models will be tested by determining whether predictions made by the model (e.g. the effects of deleting or overexpressing a gene related to iron metabolism) are realized experimentally. Models will also guide the design of new experiments, generating a unique synergy between experiments and modeling that will advance our understanding of the cell biology of iron metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have these structures and include plant and animal cells. The origin of eukaryotes (eukaryogenesis) is a major evolutionary transition in the history of life. How can eukaryogenesis and the pathways that lead to and from the prokaryote/eukaryote transition be reconstructed when fossil records are lacking? This project aims to look for the imprints left by this process at the structural and molecular levels across the diversity of modern-day eukaryotes. Such ""structural fossils"" exist in a protein assembly that defines the prokaryotic cell: the nuclear pore complex (NPC). By dissecting the NPC architecture of a unicellular eukaryote, Trypanosoma brucei, and comparing it to the available structures from other divergent species, the project expects to unravel the molecular processes that governed the evolution of the nucleus. The results should represent a compelling, modern context for teaching and disseminating fundamental concepts in structure and function relationships, molecular evolution and engineering principles of biological systems. Collaboration with the Rockefeller Science Outreach Program will make educational material to discuss evolution available to students and teachers. In addition, this program also engages high school and undergraduate students to work at Rockefeller University. <br/><br/>The structures of two of the main T. brucei NPC building blocks, the outer ring complex and the mRNA export platform, will be solved by using an integrative approach that involves: (i) gathering a diverse set of experimental data, including electron microscopy, cross-linking and mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics: (ii) translation of the resulting data into spatial restraints that are used to calculate the structure of the assembly; and finally, (iii) a detailed comparative analysis of the NPC core components and architecture, covering representative organisms across the eukaryotic lineage.

This award is aimed at generating systems level insights into the processes and dynamics that influence growth in model photosynthetic organisms. As such, this project has important implications for fundamental understanding of a complex and essential biological process, and has significant implications for biotechnology applications. Photosynthesis is the engine of life on our planet, and organisms that live off of photosynthesis, such as cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, are primarily responsible for carbon sequestration in the biosphere. On the planet today, such oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms assimilate 100 petagrams (100 gigatons) of carbon per year. In contrast, organisms that need chemical nutrients as sources of energy assimilate only 0.3 petagrams (0.3 gigatons) per year. This INSPIRE project is aimed at unraveling the most important factors that control growth rates of cyanobacteria, a model photosynthetic organism. It brings together two different fields, cyanobacteria physiology and mathematical modeling, to abstract fundamental rules of growth parameters and dynamics. It will help design tool kits for engineering cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic microorganisms to enable increased biomass production, an essential requirement for biotechnology applications for sunlight driven carbon-neutral production of food, feed and fuel. The project will also provide training for international undergraduates and engage students under the iGEM training program. <br/><br/>The team of researchers identified recently a unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus strain, UTEX 2973, with the fastest growth rate among all cyanobacterial strains studied to date. Surprisingly, this strain is a close relative of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, a well-studied model cyanobacterial strain. The two share greater than 99% genome sequence identity. However, the growth potential of Synechococcus 2973 is nearly three-fold better than Synechococcus 7942. The investigators will determine the key factors that are responsible for fast growth of cyanobacteria by applying experimental molecular approaches to compare Synechococcus 7942 with Synechococcus 2973, using adaptive evolution, and developing metabolic and expression (ME) models. They will compare the transcriptome of the two strains  under different light intensities, CO2 levels and growth phases. The integrating of ME models for Synechococcus 2973 and Synechococcus 7942 with the transcriptomic data generated are expected to uncover metabolic and expression differences that contribute to the increased biomass production of Synechococcus 2973. The photosynthetic and carbon fixation efficiencies will also be measured to better elucidate mechanistic differences between these strains. In addition, a subset of mutations identified by genome comparison will be analyzed in an effort to recapitulate the fast-growth phenotype."

In this project, a collaborative team of US (University of California, Santa Barbara) and UK (University of York) researchers will determine how CDI systems influence the development of bacterial communities, using genetically engineered bacterial cells that express different CDI toxin systems and mathematical modeling of the bacterial populations.

This project inverts the metabolic engineering paradigm by harnessing evolution instead of fighting it. The investigators developed an evolutionary approach to metabolic engineering that enables bacteria to integrate their growth environment and their engineered metabolism. The approach is called Programmed Evolution because a population of bacteria is programmed with DNA software to compute solutions to a metabolic pathway optimization problem, and evolution is used to direct the bacterial population toward optimal solutions. The goal of this project is to expand Programmed Evolution by developing a new method for new riboswitch discovery, using the new riboswitches optimally express the enzymes necessary for e the production of new compounds, and developing mathematical models and computational tools to support both processes. These approaches will reduce the cost of producing useful compounds in metabolically engineered bacteria for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals, and bioremediation. This project will increase diversity for science education, contribute to a competitive and scientifically literate workforce, and has the potential to improve American economic competitiveness.  This project responds to the call in Vision and Change for more authentic undergraduate research experiences as undergraduates pose research questions, develop testable hypotheses, collect and analyze data, and communicate results. As they learn how to program the evolution of bacteria for metabolic engineering, undergraduate research students will learn how to program the course of their own futures as science literate citizens, educators, and research scientists.<br/><br/>Programmed Evolution is a modular system for the optimization of orthogonal metabolic pathways in bacteria. It uses combinatorics, fitness, and biosensor modules that can be developed and tested separately, used in combinations, and shared among research groups. A key component of Programmed Evolution is the riboswitch that transduces metabolic output into fitness gene expression and selective advantage. Most riboswitches used in metabolic engineering incorporate RNA aptamers discovered by the in vitro process of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment. However, aptamers discovered in vitro rarely function in vivo. The investigators propose to develop Cell-based Exponential enrichment as a new in vivo method of discovering riboswitches that function predictably in bacterial cells. The new method introduces genetic variation in a riboswitch to produce a library, applies negative and positive selection, and characterizes the phenotype and genotype of new riboswitches. The significance of the new approach derives from its potential to advance knowledge of naturally occurring riboswitches and to discover new riboswitches for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals and bioremediation."

The project will have educational impacts by providing research training opportunities for underserved students, laboratory and professional development workshops for high school science teachers, and science presentations to the general public.<br/><br/>This project addresses chromatin-based gene silencing by PcG proteins in a novel model organism, the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum. The work will take advantage of the fact that Fusarium uses one Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) to deliver histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to specific genes. Preliminary data suggest that the gene recognition is mediated by PRC2 subunits or by interacting proteins and that the subsequently modified genes are sequestered as transcriptionally silent  ""PRC2 bodies"" with clear boundaries to euchromatin. The main objectives of this project are to uncover the mechanism for PRC2 targeting and to define the composition of PRC2 complexes. The aims will be achieved by multi-faceted approaches, including:  forward and reverse genetics by undirected selections and screens, gene deletions, and site-directed mutagenesis; biochemistry by chromatin immunoprecipitation, genome-wide expression analyses and mass spectrometry;  and cytology by examination of PRC2 bodies in association with DNA. In combination, these techniques will allow identification and characterization of PRC2 signals and proteins involved in gene silencing. Novel components of PRC2-mediated gene silencing in Fusarium will be characterized, and distribution of H3K27me3 and PRC2 in normal and mutant strains will be mapped. The research will provide key knowledge on PRC2-mediated silencing in eukaryotes."

PARP1 is involved in many biological processes that monitor DNA integrity, such as cell division, differentiation and cell death. The DNA in every eukaryotic cell is found in the form of a highly compact DNA-protein structure known as chromatin, that is unpacked every time when access to a particular DNA region is needed, and re-packaged immediately after this process, to ensure the fidelity of the process. PARP1 is known to mediate these chromatin rearrangements during the initiation of gene regulation. Several recent studies show that PARP1 also has another, unexpected role in the different process of RNA splicing, i.e., the mechanism that results in the correct formation of the messenger RNAs that direct protein synthesis. This research will provide better understanding of how PARP1 modulates alternative splicing to effect changes in gene regulation. In addition to making the findings widely available to other researchers via established repositories and publication/ presentation of study outcomes, the project will impact the next-generation workforce by engaging graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, particularly students from groups underrepresented in the sciences, in laboratory research in the emerging field of chromatin biology and gene regulation. Participating students will be trained in bioinformatics, large-scale genome analyses, and chromatin biology and provided guidance on science careers. High school students will complete small-scale laboratory projects and write their first computer code for data analyses. During the course of the project, five-minute movie clips on gene regulation will be created and incorporated into an existing biochemistry course. <br/> <br/>Strong evidence supports the regulatory role of chromatin in alternative splicing, an integral part of cell differentiation and development, contributing to cell lineage and tissue identity. It is known that the binding of trans-factors (enhancers or silencers) to pre-mRNA-encoded sequence elements is necessary but not sufficient for splicing regulation. The recent discovery in this laboratory that PARP1, a chromatin architectural protein involved in the regulation of transcription initiation, not only bound at transcription start sites of active genes but also bound at internal exons, irrespective of the transcriptional state, suggests different modes of gene regulation by PARP1. Additionally, recent findings showed that depletion of PARP1 or its PARylation activity resulted in specific changes in alternative splicing events, and that in vivo PARP1 bound chromatin, nascent mRNA, and splicing factors. This research will test the hypothesis that PARP1 regulates co-transcriptional splicing in two non-mutually exclusive ways: acting as an adapter molecule to recruit splicing factors to exons and/or to modulate changes to chromatin structure in ways that affect polymerase elongation and kinetics. Large-scale genomics and gene-specific approaches will be utilized to map in fine detail the genetic and biochemical interactions of PARP-1-RNA-chromatin that occur in a cell. Since the same proteins are present in all organisms throughout the animal kingdom, PARP1 likely regulates alternative decisions similarly in simple and complex organisms. Therefore, this problem will be studied in a simple organism that is readily amenable to genetic and molecular analysis, the Drosophila system. Building on the laboratory's history of student training especially minority students, this project will involve local high schools, undergraduates, and graduate students. Additionally, minority students from these schools will be sought for research opportunities in the laboratory. These individuals will be trained in bioinformatics, large-scale genome analyses and chromatin biology. Results from this project will be disseminated to the broader scientific community in the form of presentations at local, national and international meetings. Finally, the results of these studies will be published in scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings."

They will learn how research is performed and will also gain a basic understanding of genes, DNA, and evolution that is becoming increasingly more important and societally relevant. By engaging students in the practice of science, this project fulfills one of the three central dimensions in the Next Generation Science Standards recently adopted by many states across the nation and will improve scientific literacy in the general population by helping to build an informed public that understands the scientific enterprise and can better contribute to future national policy decisions that require the interpretation and evaluation of scientific data.<br/><br/>The process of speciation involves the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations within a species so that a single species can split.

The goal of the project is to identify genes that cause reproductive isolation and determine their molecular mechanisms of action. The project is focused on identifying genes that mediate incompatibility within species and will operate at three levels to: 1) determine the detailed molecular and cellular mechanism of action of a previously identified intraspecific incompatibility in the nematode C. elegans mediated by a selfish toxin/antidote gene pair, 2) identify the genes involved in a newly discovered nuclear-cytoplasmic intraspecific incompatibility in the related nematode species C. nouraguensis, and 3) systematically search for more intraspecific genetic incompatibilities within the Caenorhabditis genus in a large-scale project to isolate new strains of Caenorhabditis species using a crowdsourcing approach implemented in high school classrooms, and by systematic crosses of strains performed by undergraduate researchers to test for hybrid breakdown."

This project inverts the metabolic engineering paradigm by harnessing evolution instead of fighting it. The investigators developed an evolutionary approach to metabolic engineering that enables bacteria to integrate their growth environment and their engineered metabolism. The approach is called Programmed Evolution because a population of bacteria is programmed with DNA software to compute solutions to a metabolic pathway optimization problem, and evolution is used to direct the bacterial population toward optimal solutions. The goal of this project is to expand Programmed Evolution by developing a new method for new riboswitch discovery, using the new riboswitches optimally express the enzymes necessary for e the production of new compounds, and developing mathematical models and computational tools to support both processes. These approaches will reduce the cost of producing useful compounds in metabolically engineered bacteria for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals, and bioremediation. This project will increase diversity for science education, contribute to a competitive and scientifically literate workforce, and has the potential to improve American economic competitiveness.  This project responds to the call in Vision and Change for more authentic undergraduate research experiences as undergraduates pose research questions, develop testable hypotheses, collect and analyze data, and communicate results. As they learn how to program the evolution of bacteria for metabolic engineering, undergraduate research students will learn how to program the course of their own futures as science literate citizens, educators, and research scientists.<br/><br/>Programmed Evolution is a modular system for the optimization of orthogonal metabolic pathways in bacteria. It uses combinatorics, fitness, and biosensor modules that can be developed and tested separately, used in combinations, and shared among research groups. A key component of Programmed Evolution is the riboswitch that transduces metabolic output into fitness gene expression and selective advantage. Most riboswitches used in metabolic engineering incorporate RNA aptamers discovered by the in vitro process of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment. However, aptamers discovered in vitro rarely function in vivo. The investigators propose to develop Cell-based Exponential enrichment as a new in vivo method of discovering riboswitches that function predictably in bacterial cells. The new method introduces genetic variation in a riboswitch to produce a library, applies negative and positive selection, and characterizes the phenotype and genotype of new riboswitches. The significance of the new approach derives from its potential to advance knowledge of naturally occurring riboswitches and to discover new riboswitches for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals and bioremediation."

The challenge to understand how cells process biochemical signals that lead to phenotypic responses is largely due to the complex multi-dimensional biochemical data able to identify the relationship between molecular interactions and phenotypes. Thus, understanding the cell-decision processes has wide applicability to address fundamental and applied problems in biology. This project will study the cellular signaling switch from proliferation to programed cell death phenotypes in mammalian cells by developing tools necessary to extract useful mechanistic insights from dynamic program-driven models that will be used to guide experiments. The project offers an interdisciplinary training opportunity for undergraduate students as well as graduate students and post-doctoral associates (including members of underrepresented groups) who will conduct interdisciplinary research by integrating physical, chemical, statistical, mathematical, and computer science methods to compose computational models of cell signaling processes. In addition, the computational tools and methods developed as part of this award will be made freely available to the research community, having the potential to be further employed in other applications, such as climate modeling, communication and economics.<br/><br/>Cells constantly sense and respond to external and internal perturbations that trigger intracellular biochemical reaction networks leading to cellular phenotypic outcomes. The advent of 'omics' technologies in the last decades, in combination with statistical approaches, have yielded a correlative understanding between gene interactions, protein expression, and phenotypes. However, a mechanistic understanding of biochemical interaction network dynamics and cellular commitment to a given outcome is currently lacking. This fundamental knowledge gap to associate genotype and phenotype is largely due to the management and analysis of complex biochemical signaling networks that is needed for applications such as cell reprogramming, synthetic biology applications, and microorganism bioengineering. This project will enable the development and implementation of theoretical and computational tools, based on rigorous physical, chemical, mathematical, and statistical methods, to understand how cells commit to programmed cell death (i.e. apoptosis). The challenge is to understand how proliferating cells process external cues, and shift biochemical signaling pathways from growth to death.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Program in Mathematical Biology in the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

New isolation and culture techniques will be developed which will likely lead to the isolation of novel microorganisms and the construction of novel communities with desirable attributes from nature. Undergraduate and graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow, K-12 students and the public will be integrated into the studies through coursework, laboratory research, outreach in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Zoo, and a science program for economically disadvantaged Hispanic students.

However, the interdependency of these microbes and their impact on microbial metabolism are difficult to characterize due to their recalcitrance to culture. Recently, these challenges have been overcome through the isolation of fungi with dependent methanogens from herbivore fecal materials, creating a simplified system to model their syntrophy. Robust fungal-methanogen syntrophs from herbivores will be screened to study how pairs are matched by nature, and how co-culture accelerates biomass breakdown. Stable fungal-methanogen pairs will be used to generate a metabolism model for gut fungi, and the model will be curated with experimental data. Finally, interdependent communities containing non-native microbes (acetotrophic methanogens and facultative anaerobes) will be designed and optimized using a bottom up approach to compartmentalize biomass-degradation and bioproduct formation.

This research project focuses on resurrection plants within an economically important grass family. The project involves a detailed comparison between crop grasses and resurrection plants in order to identify genes and cellular pathways that distinguish typical drought responses, from those associated with desiccation. The interdisciplinary genomic, genetic, and evolutionary aspects of this project immerse high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the leading frontiers of plant science research. Projects in collaboration with the Michigan State University 4H Children's Garden teach students and citizen scientists about the impact of drought on agriculture. <br/><br/>Desiccation tolerance in angiosperms likely evolved through rewiring pre-existing seed desiccation pathways, but the gene and pathway level changes underlying this transition are unknown. In this project, systems-level and comparative genomics approaches are used to understand the genetic basis of desiccation tolerance in C4 grasses. The project focuses on two species from independent lineages of resurrection plants: Oropetium thomaeum, an emerging model grass, and Eragrostis nindensis, a wild South African grass closely related to the orphan cereal tef (E. tef). In the first instance, the role of gene and genome duplication in the evolution of desiccation tolerance is explored and genes under adaptive evolution are identified. Second, transcriptome, epigenome, and chromatin dynamics are surveyed at high temporal resolution during the desiccation and rehydration processes. From these datasets, a comprehensive atlas of the genes and regulatory elements controlling desiccation tolerance in grasses is developed. Finally, transcriptome and metabolite data are collected from six grass species that evolved desiccation tolerance independently to test for convergent evolution and conserved pathway rewiring. A series of educational outreach activities and teaching modules are developed to explore drought and water relations in plants. Large-scale datasets from this project are disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and deposition at the NCBI sequence archives and CyVerse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes to uncover this long-standing mystery by building circuits that are capable of memory in bacteria.  Bacterial systems are ideal for this study because they are more accessible than multi-cellular organisms, and they allow for ultra-high precision measurements. The project relies on innovative biologically friendly chips to collect streaming data from live bacteria. Specific questions address in this study are  (1) How is memory inherited through hundreds of generations in bacteria? (2) How might memory be robust enough to withstand large changes at the molecular level such as synthesis and degradation of proteins?  The project will have a large impact on the teaching of science; many courses have already adopted preliminary examples from this work. More broadly, since the goal of this project is to demonstrate that engineered circuits can accurately perform predefined tasks in living cells, this effort will fundamentally change the way we develop new tools for medicine and other uses.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of synthetic biology is to construct genetic circuits whose properties are not only robust on average as conditions change, but which can operate accurately in single cells without being corrupted by stochastic fluctuations. In many cases the dynamics also need to play out on a multi-generational time scale, which is particularly challenging because the states must be remembered even though the molecular hardware is replaced. Natural systems often face similar challenges, and though epigenetic memory is typically associated with higher organisms, bacteria must also decide between alternative states that can be maintained for tens or even hundreds of generations. Based on insights from stochastic theory for chemical reactions, and encouraged by substantial preliminary successes, this project will build synthetic oscillators and switches with multigenerational dynamics and highly precise timing in single cells. It will also characterize the on- and off-states of natural genetic circuits that exhibit slow switching, with a particular focus on DNA looping. Finally, a combination of classic bacterial genetics, microfluidic engineering, synthetic genetic oscillators, pulse generators based on DNA looping, and mathematical analyses will be used to probe the slow dynamics of flagellar promoters, which again reveal intriguing multi-generational effects. Thus, the project takes a broad systems and synthetic approach to quantify multigenerational switching at the level of individual bacterial cells."

Because the subsurface is shut off from oxygen in the atmosphere, these microbes need to find alternative compounds to ""breathe"" (reduction), in order to carry out the energetic cycles necessary to drive life. Sulfur and oxygen share many characteristics, including their ability to serve as ""breathable"" compounds. To better understand sulfur reduction, this project will incorporate different studies that will look at sulfur chemistry; protein biochemistry; and the genetics of sulfur-based ""breathing"" (respiration) in a hot, petroleum-rich subsurface environment. Together, these studies will help with understanding how these living systems are able to develop deep in the earth, how life might have evolved on the early oxygen-free earth, and even how life might evolve in other places in the universe. Undergraduate researchers will conduct the studies, with experienced undergraduates mentoring young researchers through successful programs designed for the retention of underrepresented and lower income students in science; therefore creating a stronger multicultural scientific teaching and research community. These studies will also be integrated into undergraduate courses in Microbial Ecology and Bioinformatics, in which data obtained in the Microbial Ecology laboratory experiments will be analyzed by the students in the Bioinformatics course.<br/><br/>Sulfur-based respiration is suggested to have been one of the earliest energy conserving pathways for life on earth. It remains important to the sulfur and elemental cycles in the atmosphere, oceans, sediments, and deep subsurface. It is also of specific interest in petrochemical and other fields due to the extremely corrosive and toxic effect of microbially-produced sulfides. It is not at all clear which forms of sulfur contribute to the metabolism mechanisms of microbial sulfur respiration in situ, or how these enzymes mechanistically carry out this transformation. The relative levels of sulfur-reducing enzymes and microbes in many environments remain unknown. These overarching questions will be approached by focusing on a specific environment - a deep, hot, hydrocarbon-rich reservoir - and by integrating studies: (1) at the level of the microbial community by characterizing the microbes in the deep, hot subsurface environment and identifying sulfur-reducing microbes and enzymes through metagenomics and metatranscriptomics; (2) at the enzymatic level by determining the mechanisms of sulfur-reducing enzymes by kinetic and structural techniques; and (3) at the geochemical level by using cyclic voltammetry to determine the chemical speciation of sulfur in situ and during reduction by microbes and enzymes. A transformative aspect of this work is a way in which cyclic voltammetry will be used to obtain a ""snapshot"" of the entire range of sulfur species present during the reduction of sulfur by enzymes, isolated microbial species, and microbial populations. This work will also provide a view of the sulfur chemical species present in deep subsurface fluids in situ. Having a clear picture of sulfur metabolism in the deep subsurface will broaden our understanding of biogeochemical sulfur cycling, life in extreme environments, and evolutionary processes. It has been estimated that the subsurface environment contains 40-60% of the bacterial cells on earth, accounting for at least one third of the earth's carbon biomass. However, because of its hidden nature, this huge reservoir of biodiversity has only begun to be explored."

Cellular diversity is achieved through an asymmetric cell division, in which two produced daughter cells have different fates. The mechanism that generates different cell fates, during division, can either be generated by the mother cells itself (intrinsic) or by factors outside of the cell (extrinsic).  Development of the central nervous system (CNS) in multicellular organisms relies on both extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect asymmetric cell divisions, but the nature of these factors are poorly understood.  The goal of the proposed research is to define an intrinsic factor that leads to the production of daughter cells with different cellular fates.  This work will be performed in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which has served as an outstanding research model leading to many discoveries.  Importantly, these discoveries in the fruitfly, has informed much of our knowledge involving the development of other multicellular organisms (including humans).  The PI has preliminary data demonstrating an asymmetric partitioning during cell division of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), a major and critical intrinsic component of the cell.  The ER is partitioned unequally into one daughter cell prior to the subsequent division of a subset of cells that will eventually develop into the CNS of the adult fly.  The central hypothesis is that the ER is partitioned asymmetrically for the establishment of key cues that dictate cellular fate.  Experiments are designed that will provide new insight into the issue of the generation of cell diversity, a fundamental question in biology.  On the broader scientific level, the proposed research will integrate research and education by promoting diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field. This will be accomplished by the creation of a Biology Undergraduate Mentor Program (BUMP) and will utilize the technique of near-peer mentoring for the recruitment and retention of students within STEM majors.  Furthermore, BUMP mentors and mentees will provide community service opportunities at a local elementary school addressing the national need for more STEM mentoring.<br/><br/>The PI's long-term research goal is to investigate the mechanisms of cell asymmetry and identify the signal(s) responsible for determining cell fate. The goal of the proposed research is to define the pathway of inheritance involving cell fate determinants and identify novel targets involved in the their transport and partitioning using the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. The central hypothesis is that the ER is partitioned asymmetrically due to the interaction of the highly conserved transmembrane protein Jagunal (Jagn) with the cell cortex and is responsible for the establishment of key cell fate determinants. The PI will be the first to investigate the role of Jagn in asymmetric cell division and has demonstrated that the asymmetric partitioning of the ER observed in the neural epithelia is Jagn dependent. The PI will employ both genetic and in vivo cytological approaches to investigate the role of Jagn on development and neural cell fate. In addition, the PI will involve undergraduate researchers to identify targets that interact with Jagn by performing a dominant modifier-based screen of the Drosophila genome towards control asymmetric ER partitioning during mitosis. The experiments set forth in this application will provide new insight into the larger issue of the generation of cell diversity and has the potential to open the field to new models of asymmetric divisions."

Microtubule polymers play vital cellular roles in transport and signaling processes in all higher organisms. These processes depend on the ability of microtubules to switch between states of assembly and disassembly. To gain new insight into the mechanism of microtubule dynamics (assembly and disassembly), the research program will generate tubulin mutants that mimic sequence differences from cold-adapted organisms, which exhibit highly stable microtubules, and determine how these mutations impact microtubule dynamics. The results of these experiments will address a critical gap in our understanding of how changes in tubulin structure determine its propensity to assemble or disassemble, thereby providing a major advance for the microtubule field. In addition, this project will impact our broader understanding of molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation. To further broaden the impact of the project, the Principal Investigator's laboratory will partner with students and teachers from Denver public high schools with underrepresented minority populations in a collaborative research-education program. This program will advance the research goals of the project while training high school teachers and students in the process of hypothesis-driven science, techniques in molecular biology, communication skills, and gaining exposure to the broader research community, thereby exciting and empowering future scientists.<br/>   <br/>This project will uniquely contribute to ongoing structural/function studies of tubulin proteins and microtubules. Whereas crystallographic approaches provide detailed molecular snapshots of stable conformations of the tubulin proteins, the project's genetic approach is uniquely suited to define the roles of dynamic regions of tubulins that are not accessible to crystallography. The Principal Investigator will use a combination of sequence data from cold tolerant organisms and unbiased genetic screens to identify amino acid changes that enhance microtubule stability, and to determine the basis of enhanced stability using in silico protein modeling and quantitative assays of microtubule activity in cells and in a minimal system with purified proteins."

Hence, understanding the interplay of microbial gut communities and the host is highly important.  The investigators will use Ciona robusta (Ciona intestinalis type A), a marine filter-feeding organism, to investigate how animals use elements of their immune system to regulate healthy interactions with microbes that like to live in the gut.  As Ciona is transparent, it represents a unique model organism in which gut microbial communities can be visualized directly.  Ciona also is a great teaching tool for students in the classroom and for public outreach in the PIs seasonal programs like the St. Petersburg Science Festival or the Oceanography Camp for Girls.  The investigators will utilize animals reared in the lab under controlled conditions to help students understand how distinct microbes colonize the gut, and illustrate natural mechanisms used by animals to influence where and how these microbes settle within the gut. <br/><br/>Ciona robusta (Ciona intestinalis type A), an invertebrate filter-feeding protochordate, will be used to investigate how the host utilizes elements of innate immunity to negotiate interactions with the gut microbiome.  The proposal focuses on variable immunoglobulin-like chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs).  VCBPs are bifunctional; the N-terminal Ig domains recognize bacteria and the C-terminal domain binds chitin.  VCBPs are a key to understanding complex dialogues between bacteria, fungi and viruses of the gut microbiome.  These proteins are expressed and secreted in high abundance by the gut epithelium in Ciona, and exhibit functions that resemble vertebrate IgA, including the modulation of bacterial adherence and formation of biofilms on mucosal surfaces.  Preliminary data reveal that when VCBP-C binds to some lysogens, induction of prophages is observed, a process that shapes the outcome of biofilm formation and may impact the growth of other bacteria that may be targeted by the newly released phages.  Various bacterial and fungal isolates, derived from the gut of Ciona, have been cultured and will now be studied both in vitro and in vivo utilizing germ-free animals.  This project, via a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, will examine the interaction between VCBP-C and cultured isolates (bacterial and fungal) of the gut; we will then examine transcriptomes of in vitro (bacterial) biofilm formation and colonization of germ-free animals to help characterize the genetics of colonization.  As multi-functional proteins, the VCBPs likely bridge interactions between bacterial and fungal communities of the microbiome; and because VCBPs influence the induction of prophages, which in preliminary observations have been shown to possess broad host ranges, it is likely that activation of these viruses can re-shape the composition of the microbiome.  The Ciona model presents a unique opportunity to study how innate immunity not only protects against pathogens but also modulates microbial ecology to achieve and maintain homeostasis.  Ciona will continue to serve as a platform to further explore the hypothesis that immunity evolved not just to ""defend"" but to ""modulate microbial ecology"" of the gut lumen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work uses a unique experimental setup to measure protein vibrations, as well as a collaborative approach to improve the predictive power of calculations based on the experimental measurements.  The research will train graduate students and undergraduates in interdisciplinary research (optical physics, molecular biology, materials science and computational chemistry). In addition, a large number of undergraduates and high school students will participate in experiential learning, with hands-on measurements and calculations on proteins that respond to light such as light harvesting proteins involved in photosynthesis.  To increase international and cultural awareness, students, supported by a collaborator in Mexico, will participate in the research and produce instructional media in Spanish.<br/>  <br/>The researchers will investigate the role of intramolecular motions in protein function by applying a unique tool developed to directly measure protein intramolecular vibrational motions: anisotropy terahertz microscopy (ATM). The work will focus on several bench marking proteins which have been extensively studied by other techniques to characterize structure and dynamics. Combined with molecular modeling, ATM measurements of photoactive yellow protein (PYP), chicken egg white lysozyme (CEWL) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and their mutants will identify long range structural motions that impact function. The measurements on PYP will examine if vibrations within the protein backbone enhance chromophore isomerization for photoactive proteins, such as light sensing protein in the eye, rhodopsin.   The proposed measurements will determine if collective vibrations overlap the oscillations of the PYP chromophore, and if photocycling is impacted by detuning the frequencies. The measurements will also examine if remote mutations of CEWL and DHFR affect catalytic rates by perturbing the intramolecular dynamics.

Some organisms can only tolerate very small fluctuations in oxygen availability. Others, including many bacteria and fungi are able to live with or without oxygen, and at all oxygen concentrations in between. These organisms accomplish this flexibility by shifting how they generate energy from an oxygen-dependent process called aerobic respiration to oxygen-independent processes like fermentation. This flexibility allows these organisms to live in a wide variety of different environments, but it comes at a cost. The overall goal of this project is to better understand the molecular and genetic basis of that cost. To date, this has been investigated in a very small number of organisms, leaving a major gap in our understanding of why some organisms are better equipped than others to adjust to fluctuating oxygen availability in natural environments. This project will fill that gap by comparing the molecular response of a much larger number of bacteria. Results from this project will have implications for understanding how oxygen availability impacts interaction of bacteria with plant and animal hosts. Project results will also have implications for biotechnology applications, like biofuel generation and other engineered bioprocesses which depend on manipulation of oxygen availability in industrial settings.

These RNA molecules, code for, and regulate other biological molecules that perform cellular functions. Synthesis, processing, and destruction of these RNAs is frequently spatially organized into compartments found in all domains of eukaryotic life, from single-celled fungi to the specialized cells of multicellular organisms. These micron-sized structures have long been observed by microscopy in different cell types and locations but only recently have they been identified as membraneless organelles. This project will visualize the molecular contacts that hold together membraneless organelles associated with RNA transcription and processing. These data will be essential to understand how these organelles assemble, how they function, and how the formation and dissolution of these assemblies is regulated. The plan for outreach provides an opportunity for local K-12 public school students to contribute to this detailed view of phase separating protein biophysics. The PI will 1) develop a module highlighting the biological importance of protein structure and disorder for a Rhode Island high school science outreach program, including training and competition using Foldit, the protein folding/interaction video game, 2) pair two high school students per year from this program with an undergraduate student mentor for a one month project characterizing protein structure and phase separation, 3) archive the lesson and hands-on training materials in a public database. <br/><br/>Proteins with unstructured/disordered regions containing a large amount of the amino acid glutamine are necessary for assembly of many of the membraneless organelles in vivo and are sufficient for liquid-liquid phase separation into protein droplets in vitro. Yet, the contacts formed within membraneless organelles are invisible to traditional techniques in structural biology. Therefore, membraneless organelle molecular architecture and mechanistic function remain poorly understood. The planned research will answer the general question: How do the glutamine-rich sequences in intrinsically disordered protein domains encode the structure and interactions associated with self- and co-assembly into membraneless organelles? The question will be answered by characterizing the atomic structure and interactions of glutamine-rich domains and their assemblies using NMR spectroscopy, microscopy, and molecular simulation. Three different glutamine-rich proteins found in yeast and invertebrate animals all known to be essential for physiological membraneless organelle formation will be used as models. As representative members of a diverse family of proteins, the results of the project will serve as the foundation for understanding the structure, interactions, regulation, and function of an entire class of RNA processing assemblies. Structural models and in vitro findings will be tested in established in cell phase separation and in organism phenotypic assays. This work serves as the first step in the long-term objective to map the mechanistic link between the sequence, structure and complexes of low complexity interaction domains and their assembly into membraneless organelles.

These membranes contain numerous membrane proteins. In the inner membrane, most proteins adopt a helical form termed alpha-helical fold, whereas in the outer membrane they almost all form sheet-like structures by side-by-side alignment of protein strands, which is termed beta-sheet fold. The outer membrane contains proteins with large, open pores, rendering it unable to contain chemical energy stored in small molecules such as ATP or in the form of an ion gradient. Therefore, an alternative source of energy is required for complex processes such as insertion of proteins to membrane or secretion of proteins through the membrane. It is the goal of this project to determine the feasibility of protein folding itself as the source of energy. <br/><br/>This project seeks to change a common paradigm in high school biology instruction, in which cells and the systems contained within are often seen as static and highly directed. Through molecular visualization of simulation data, the dynamic nature of proteins becomes readily apparent. Multiple modules on specific topics, such as the assembly of membranes and diffusion through membrane-bound channels, will be developed and implemented in high school classrooms in the North Georgia area. These modules emphasize the construction of explanatory models for the observed behavior, a key element of future science standards. Their implementation will be aided by the development of a simplified interface for the visualization program VMD. Assessment of the modules' impact will first be conducted in three classrooms before expanding to a wider audience through web distribution. Graduate and undergraduate students will be highly involved in the entire process, giving them training beyond just research. <br/><br/>Multiple theoretical models have been proposed to explain how the folding of proteins to form beta-sheet can provide energy. In this proposal, computational investigations will be performed to determine, the energetic aspects of the formation of these structures through protein folding (1) in isolation, (2) in the insertion of outer-membrane-bound proteins and (3) in the secretion of auto transporter domains across the membrane. Quantitative determination of the energetic aspects of these processes will be used to evaluate and refine existing models. Investigations into two specific systems will be used to elucidate how outer-membrane proteins are inserted by BamA and how virulence protein domains are secreted by autotransporters, both being energized by their own folding. The specific objectives are to (1) characterize the free-energy landscape and stability of beta-sheet structures; (2) determine how BamA catalyzes the insertion and folding of outer-membrane proteins; (3) resolve the molecular sequence of events in autotransporter folding; and (4) integrate dynamics of biological systems into high school instruction.

These studies will be performed in the multi-cellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans by using a combination of genetic, cytological, molecular, and biochemical tools available for this model system. The first aim will identify the mechanism by which protein modification regulates SC assembly by the prevention of SC aggregation. The second aim will investigate how nuclear transport controls SC assembly and reduces SC protein aggregation.

One important way that cells respond is through changes in gene expression, which is typically monitored by measuring mRNA abundance. However, changes in mRNA abundance have not been a highly predictive tool for understanding growth and development. This project will address whether specific mRNA decay characteristics improve predictive power by investigating RNA decay rates in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in response to signals that drive development. Information learned through this study will provide deeper understanding of developmental signals and their cellular responses, which will yield better predictions of how targeted genetic changes might lead to desired traits in agriculture and medicine. Project participants will be involved in local K-12 science education.  Undergraduate scientists, including those from under-represented groups, will be trained in modern molecular and cell biology techniques. <br/><br/>This project will investigate a rule of life that high rates of RNA flux, or fast RNA turnover, provide predictive power when analyzing transcriptome data because high-flux RNAs are expected to have the fastest abundance-level response to an inductive signal. The project will follow mRNA decay rate responses to inductive signals with a focus on vascular development, an important emergent property of plants. mRNA decay rates will be analyzed genome-wide using mathematical modeling approaches to identify two mRNA decay rate parameters, flux and the beta parameter, and mRNAs whose decay rates change over the time course of vascular development. The project will test whether changes in mRNA decay rates are necessary by imposing constitutive fast or slow decay, while controlling for protein abundance, and comparing induced vascular development responses of wild type and decay-rate-modified tissues. The new experimental tool for engineering stability (or instability) into RNAs has the potential to also impact synthetic biology approaches. Elucidation of the role of RNA flux in fine control of gene expression as a rule of life might lead to better forecasting of the post-transcriptional regulatory potential of genes responsible for controlling emergent properties such as development of leaf vascular patterning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multicellular organisms such as plants react to abiotic stress with a multitude of physiological and molecular responses orchestrated by key regulatory proteins, or transcription factors. The activity of these transcription factors allows the plant to adapt to environmental change and maintain homeostasis. Experimental datasets, such as transcriptional profiles, are currently analyzed by computational tools that are inadequate to uncover novel stress response regulatory proteins. The objective of this project is to develop a novel computing and modeling paradigm with sufficient power to identify previously uncharacterized regulatory components involved in the control of iron homeostasis in A. thaliana across multiple cell types. INTELLECUTAL MERIT: The interdisciplinary approach proposed by these PIs presents a new paradigm that unifies novel genomic experimental techniques, engineering modeling approaches, and parallel computing to clarify the role of known regulatory elements involved in iron homeostasis within and across different cell types. The integration of systems engineering, plant biology, and computer engineering will help create new solutions to existing problems and encourages a vision for addressing challenging issues that remain intimidating using traditional approaches. BROADER IMPACTS: The investigators will develop novel tools to help map the regulatory control points that enable plants to respond to biological and non-biological stressors. A project website will serve as a conduit to the research community, making available repositories of microarray data, computer codes and the computing frameworks. The proposed multi-disciplinary approach will streamline resources and expertise with the goal to increase crop yields under stress conditions. This will be necessary to meet the grand challenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050. North Carolina State University is a natural place to develop this interdisciplinary integration due to historical success of the institution in engineering and plant biology. Through this project, the PIs will support the interdisciplinary education of four PhD students. The investigators also plan to integrate concepts from the proposed research into an outreach initiative to expose students from 8th and 9th grades to the idea that plant can deal with stress through selective and targeted gene expression mechanisms. The goal is to expand on current relationships establish by these PIs with local middle (Leesville Middle) and high school (Wakefield High) science teachers through the Kenan Fellows program (http://kenanfellows.org/)to incorporate targeted lesson plans into their biotechnology learning modules."

However, even today, the only certain way to remove biofilms is by mechanical force, i.e. a toothbrush. While brushing teeth is routine, removal of biofilms from ships, pipes, medical devices etc., is exceedingly difficult. Formation of biofilms is one of the major survival mechanisms utilized by bacteria, but knowledge of how it occurs is rudimentary. Bacterial persisters, a genetically identical sub-population of quiescent cells that express protein toxins and exhibit multidrug tolerance, are at the core of biofilm formation and in enabling bacteria adapt to changing environmental conditions. Gene pairs known as toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have emerged as key components of this adaptation process. This project will determine how toxins block bacterial growth by discovering how they inactivate substrates, how they are inhibited by antitoxins and how bacteria remove toxins in order to exit persistence. In addition to helping discover novel approaches for controlling biofilms, the project will provide research training opportunities for students and STEM education opportunities for high school students through implementation of the Protein Science Workshop in the UA BIOTECH outreach project.<br/><br/>Many TA toxins, including MqsR, the focus of this proposal, are ribonucleases (RNases). In order to control biofilm formation, an understanding of how RNase toxins regulate bacterial growth and arrest must be obtained. The research will determine how MqsR recognizes and cleaves mRNA substrates. Preliminary data suggest that this information will lead to a novel mechanism used by RNases to digest mRNA. The project will also identify how antitoxin MqsA inhibits MqsR activity, facilitating development of new approaches for toxin inhibition/modulation. Finally, the molecular determinants that direct MqsA and MqsR proteolysis and turnover in bacteria will be determined. These will define protein recognition sites that can be used to control TA turnover in cells, and provide new insights into the mechanisms used by bacterial proteases to recognize their endogenous substrates. An integrated structural, biochemical and cellular approach will be utilized to address these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the genetic elements found in those regions of the genome do not code for proteins (the building blocks of cells) and have thus been named ""non-coding RNAs"". A few of these non-coding RNAs are known to play important roles in the biology of organisms, mainly by their capacity to turn other genes on or off. However, it is not clear if most of the non-coding RNAs that have been catalogued are even functional. This project seeks to address that gap in understanding by using patterns of evolutionary conservation in two fruit fly species to identify candidate non-coding RNAs for functional characterization. Because non-coding RNAs are found in many organisms, from flies to plants to humans, the results could have far-reaching impact. The work will be carried out by college students at graduate and undergraduate levels, thus providing them with valuable training experiences. In addition, the project will provide research experience and support with curriculum development for K-12 science teachers. <br/><br/>One of the most exciting recent advances in molecular biology has been the discovery of a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the transcriptomes of eukaryotic organisms. Although about a dozen lncRNAs are known to play important roles in a broad spectrum of developmental and physiological phenomena, our understanding of lncRNA function lags significantly behind our ability to quickly catalog them using RNA sequencing and computational approaches. Given that there are thousands of lncRNAs in any given genome, one essential approach to select relevant lncRNAs for functional characterization is to focus on lncRNAs with strong patterns of evolutionary conservation. This project will focus on a group of lncRNAs that are conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, species that diverged from their common ancestor 25-40 million years ago. These lncRNAs show small but detectable levels of DNA sequence conservation, conserved synteny, and conserved developmental expression patterns that suggest shared function in the two species. This project will characterize the phenotypic effects of that group of evolutionary conserved lncRNAs in Drosophila. Aims will include first confirming that the conserved putative lncRNAs are independent untranslated transcripts using a combination of IsoSeq and Riboseq data, then identifying their patterns of tissue-specific expression in both species using RNAseq, and finally targeting a group of the lncRNAs for functional analysis using using transcript disruption enabled by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in D. melanogaster. The methods developed in this study should have broad applicability across other organisms, and the functional studies should add substantially to our understanding of what lncRNAs do."

For function, proteins have evolved to possess unique three-dimensional (3D) structural properties. This project focuses on an important newly recognized class of proteins that exploit highly flexible 3D structures for function. These proteins include so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that account for about one-third of all eukaryotic proteins and are key components of cellular signaling and regulatory networks. This project will develop efficient computational methods for simulating flexible proteins and uncover the fundamental principles of how structural disorder mediates protein function. The new computational tools will be made available to the broad scientific community and can be applied to study biomolecular dynamics and interactions in general. Besides training of graduate and undergraduate students, the PI will contribute to various outreach programs in western Massachusetts that engage women and other under-represented minorities in STEM fields. He will also help expand an informal science education project known as the ""Molecular Playground"", which installs interactive molecular displays in public spaces such as schools, museums, shopping malls and airports. This project will add much-needed contents with protein dynamics, such as to illustrate the fascinating phenomenon how extreme conformational flexibility of IDPs support function.   <br/><br/>The overarching research objective of this project is to determine the fundamental principles that allow flexible proteins such as IDPs to undergo rapid binding-induced folding or unfolding for viable cellular signaling. Greater utilization of flexible proteins such as IDPs have been associated with increasingly sophisticated signaling in complex multicellular organisms. However, the frequent requirement of large-scale conformational transitions for binding flexible proteins can lead to a potential kinetic bottleneck detrimental to effective cellular signaling. It is hypothesized that long-range electrostatic interactions between enriched charges on IDPs and their binding targets play a key role in promoting facile binding. A specific hypothesis to be tested is that long-range electrostatic forces not only accelerate IDP encounter, but also promote folding-competent encounter topologies to allow efficient folding upon encounter. This project will also tackle an emerging phenomenon known as regulated unfolding in cellular signaling and determine how transient hydrophobic interactions may reduce transition barriers and contribute to efficient coupled binding, folding and unfolding in Bcl-2 family proteins. To test these hypotheses, new GPU-accelerated, implicit solvent-based atomistic simulation techniques will be developed to enable efficient calculation of the free energy, pathway and kinetics of binding-induced large-scale protein conformational transitions. Results from equilibrium and kinetic simulations will be validated using existing mechanistic and kinetic data as well as new measurements performed in collaboration with experimental labs.

This research will investigate how ETS proteins recognize their target DNA sites, and in turn inform the broader process by which cells develop and adapt to their biological environment. Knowledge from this project will serve as the basis for training several graduate and undergraduate students, as well as for developing curricular material at Washington State University and Georgia State University. The particular demographics of these institutions stand to benefit significantly from NSF support in STEM disciplines in general and biophysical science in particular.<br/><br/>The ETS family of transcription factors is ubiquitous in animals (the Metazoa) and regulates the transcription of large networks of genes. Their biological functions depend on site-specific DNA recognition as determined by a structurally conserved DNA-binding domain (known as the ETS domain). Although ETS domains share strong structural conservation, their amino acid sequences are also highly divergent. Preliminary data on PU.1 and Ets-1, two ETS members that represent the extremes of primary sequence divergence, indicate that this diversity encodes distinctive differences in DNA recognition by ETS members. This project is aimed at delineating the mechanisms of sequence recognition utilized by ETS proteins through the kinetics and coupling of the thermodynamics of site recognition to the solution environment.

Cooperative iron acquisition is crucial to the survival of many microbial communities, but it is vulnerable to exploitation by social cheaters that reap the benefits of iron acquisition without paying the cost. Cooperative iron acquisition is widespread in microbial communities, including communities that are important for soil ecology, agriculture, and medicine. This work will provide important information about the conditions and circumstances that stabilize such communities and general information about how more complex communities are stabilized. This project will contribute to the training and career development of students at the graduate, undergraduate and high school levels.<br/><br/>Much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms of microbial cooperative behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and nutrient acquisition. However, only recently have microbiologists also begun to investigate these behaviors from the perspective of social evolution. The focus of this project is on the evolutionary stability of cooperative iron acquisition in pseudomonads. Several Pseudomonas species acquire iron by secreting pyoverdines, a structurally diverse class of non-ribosomal peptide siderophores that are internalized by cognate receptors. The evolutionary stability of pyoverdine cooperation is challenged by intraspecific cheating between P. aeruginosa pyoverdine producers and non-producers, and by interspecific cheating between two Pseudomonas species, P. aeruginosa and P. protegens, in which the latter recognizes the pyoverdine produced by the former but not vice versa. Both cases involve the potential exploitation of cooperative pyoverdine production by cells that reap the benefits without paying the costs. Based on preliminary experimental and modeling data, it is hypothesized that bacterial growth physiology, specifically the nature of the growth-rate limiting nutrient, and asymmetric competition, specifically pyoverdine receptor affinity, are two important factors that determine the costs and benefits of cheating. These hypotheses will be tested with a combination of modeling and experimental work. Modeling will involve whole-genome metabolic models and dynamic population growth models. Experimental work will involve batch and chemostat growth of single and co-cultures under defined nutrient conditions, as well as measurements of pyoverdine receptor binding affinities and expression levels. These studies will provide insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the evolutionary stability of cooperative iron acquisition. Cooperative iron acquisition and other microbial social behaviors are of great relevance to natural ecosystems and have implications for the evolution of sociality in general. Graduate, Undergraduate and high school students will be trained in a wide range of skills in microbial genetics, physiology, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, and mathematical modeling.

Despite more than three decades of study, this fundamental mode of biological communication remains unsolved at the molecular level. A thorough understanding of allosteric communication will facilitate the development of new protein design rules. The design of ""custom made"" allosteric functions promises to revolutionize biotechnology, namely with regard to the development of more competent biological drugs, diagnostic tools, and industrial processes. These technological advances will be achieved by enabling precise and predictable biological communication in response to desired environmental cues. In addition to advancing our understanding of allosteric communication, this study will enable the development of new scientists in a cutting-edge research area, and will include the training of underrepresented groups in STEM. This initiative will contribute to the development of a diverse and engaged science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism by which allosteric signals traverse the scaffold across LacI variants with alternate allosteric control. This study will be accomplished by the construction and characterization of a synthetic phylogenetic tree of alternate allosteric networks. To complement inferred evolutionary relationships, experimental maps of communication will be constructed for two or more linages. Members of a given linage will be evaluated biophysically to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism. Phylogenetic and biophysical data will be leveraged to design alternate allosteric routes in the LacI scaffold in which precise performance metrics (i.e., tuned dynamic range, ligand sensitivity and temporal responsiveness) are conferred. This study will help identify whether allostery in the LacI scaffold can be conferred via multiple networks of residues, or whether allostery requires a single conserved network of residues. Upon completion, this study will enable the testing of assertions with regards to the origin and molecular mechanics of alternate allosteric communication via the development of design rules for specific allosteric operations.  In turn, this algorithm will produce novel LacI-based transcription factors for use in a broad range of biotechnological applications, specifically in synthetic biology. In addition, this study will significantly broaden our fundamental understanding of allosteric communication."

One key to improving plant productivity is to understand better the control of their growth and development. Plants possess stem cells, whose division and differentiation is central to plant growth and the building of new organs.  Current understanding of plant stem cell regulation does not address well the complex networks of regulation that are involved. This project will use the model plant Arabidopsis to experimentally identify the essential features that govern stem cell regulatory networks in the developing root, and will develop accurate mathematical models that describe the behaviour of these networks. The root captures nutrients essential to the plant, and knowledge of the rules controlling root stem cell behaviour will facilitate the future development of plants for crop improvement. The project will provide cross-training and education to students through the development of courses at the interface between plant biology and bioengineering.  These courses will be tailored to the needs of a diverse target audience.  The research team will engage a wider audience, ranging from K-12 students to adults, to inform the public on important issues including plant stem cells, plant bioengineering, and crop improvement. <br/> <br/>A key to systems-level understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating stem cells is the ability to analyse the dynamics of networks in the context of a living organism.  Identifying the essential features that govern stem cell regulatory networks and their emergent behaviours will contribute to an accurate understanding of the design rules governing cell pluripotency. This project integrates techniques derived from biological, mathematical, and engineering science to elucidate mechanisms that regulate plant stem cell fate and maintenance.  The project's foundation will be based on the transcriptional profile of two Arabidopsis root stem cell populations, the cortex/endodermal initials (CEI) and xylem (XYL), as well as the quiescent centre cells that maintain the stem cells in their undifferentiated status.  Bayesian modelling of transcriptional dynamics, and perturbation testing of the models, have revealed TARGET OF MONOPTEROS3 (TMO3) to be a key regulator of both CEI and XYL stem cells.  Novel imaging techniques have been developed that will enable quantitative measurements of diffusion, concentration, and interactions of molecular factors responsible for signalling between stem cells.  By integrating these data with mathematical modelling, the project will achieve an improved understanding of how stem cell division is precisely regulated in space and time.  The project's research goals are to:  1) characterize the transcriptional signature responsible for stem cell regulation and to test the hypothesis that interacting transcriptional networks operate across different stem cells; and 2) generate mathematical models that incorporate spatial and temporal information to describe communication between stem cells.  After determining which parameters are critical to generate a robust mathematical model, models will be generated that describe how regulator signals are propagated between and among cells, and will identify perturbations capable of resetting decision-making signals.  These efforts will provide a framework for comparing stem cell development in plants and animals, and will contribute to future plant breeding efforts in the face of climate uncertainty."

Special emphasis of the workshop will be on combining high-performance computation with neutron scattering. Education and broader impact activities to enable better access to neutron scattering methodologies will also be a focus of the discussion. The workshop will provide a road-map by defining the scientific, engineering and data challenges required to use neutron scattering as a tool to study biological systems.<br/><br/>Recent world-wide research and development activities have created an opportunity to use neutron scattering as another vital tool in biological research.  This technology offers excellent potential to provide previously elusive information about complex biological systems unobtainable with other measurement tools. Neutrons are ideal for studying multi-scale phenomena intrinsic to biological processes. With no charge, they cause little radiation damage and are highly penetrating, enabling use of complex sample environments. Also, neutrons have energies similar to atomic motions, and their spin can be coupled to magnetic fields in spin echo measurements, allowing the study of dynamic processes over a wide range of timescales, from picoseconds to microseconds. Moreover, a particularly desirable property of neutrons for biology has to do with hydrogen (H), the most abundant element in biological systems. Photons and electrons interact with the atomic electric field. With just one electron, hydrogen is all but invisible to x-rays or light. Neutrons, on the other hand, interact with nuclei, and protons have a relatively strong and negative scattering length. The isotope deuterium (D) has an even stronger scattering length, which is positive. This different sensitivity of neutrons to H and D allows for enhanced visibility of specific parts of complex biological systems through isotopic substitution. These properties are the foundation by which neutron scattering can be used to obtain precise information on the location and dynamics of H at the atomic level, as well as truly unique information on large, dynamic, multi-domain complexes at longer length and time scales. The workshop will discuss neutron crystallography, small angle scattering, diffraction, reflectometry and imaging for studying soft matter structure from the atomic to micrometer length scales and, via spectroscopic measurements, self and collective motions and excitations from sub-picosecond to microsecond timescales. <br/><br/>This workshop is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate, and by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, both in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

However, it remains an open question what roles the genome itself plays in such fundamental DNA-directed processes. One critical barrier to answering this question is the lack of quantitative knowledge of how chromatin, the material form of the genome that consists of a complex assembly of nucleic acid and protein, is organized in three dimensional space and how the chromatin organization changes in response to various biological, chemical and physical factors in the cellular environment. This project will develop and use state-of-the-art experimental techniques combined with extensive data-driven computational modeling, with the goal to reconstruct three dimensional structures of chromatin. Through systematic studies of model chromatin systems in wide-ranging solution conditions, this project further aims to elucidate the governing principles of chromatin organization. Along with the research effort, this project will enrich educational experiences for broadly represented student groups, particularly in response to the current challenge of engaging and retaining students in STEM education. Specific emphasis will be placed on incorporating underrepresented groups in research and educational activities.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to gain systematic, mechanistic understandings of the conformation and dynamics of chromatin modulated by solution conditions, genetic and epigenetic variations, and chromatin-architectural proteins. Folding of chromatin from its open structure of 'beads-on-a-string' is an intricate process that has challenged researchers for decades, in  part due to the complex set of governing physical and biochemical factors, and in part due to the lack of experimental approaches at the pertinent length scales above the mono-nucleosome level (i.e., one to tens of nanometers). This project addresses both challenges by applying solution small angle x-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) to the biochemically defined system of recombinant nucleosome arrays. The use of strong positioning DNA sequences yields regularly spaced and stable arrays of nucleosomes, and SAXS/SANS measures the distribution of inter-nucleosome mesoscale distances as the array folds. SAXS/SANS further has unique advantages of probing array native structures directly in solution and decomposing protein and DNA components via contrast variation. Significant efforts will be directed towards applying and developing data-driven computational modeling methods to reconstruct the three dimensional structures of nucleosome arrays. To dissect the multifactorial determinants of folding, arrays of increasing lengths (2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 nucleosomes) will be analyzed under relevant conditions   of ions, molecular crowding, linker DNAs, histone variations, and chromatin architectural proteins. Completion of this project is expected to elucidate detailed mesoscale structures of nucleosome arrays in solution and the molecular mechanisms of chromatin folding, and to shed light on the genetics/epigenetics-structure-function relationship of chromatin in vivo.

In contrast to bacteria, which have a simple one-to-one relationship between gene and product, in complex organisms, gene expression requires large-scale rearrangements that add, remove and combine information.  Such ""RNA splicing"" is ubiquitous and remarkably diverse across all complex life, yet it remains almost completely mysterious outside of very few model organisms.  The project will develop bioinformatic software to leverage available biological sequence data from hundreds of diverse species to: discover millions of cases of splicing; identify the general form and function of splicing in each species; and illuminate the molecular processes by which splicing occurs.   By advancing understanding of the outputs and processes of gene expression, this project will elucidate how organisms function, from ourselves to countless crops, parasites, pests, and commensal organisms.  In addition, the project will advance training of a diverse and skilled workforce by training graduate, undergraduate and community college students in biological and computational sciences at one of our nation's most diverse comprehensive universities.  Finally, the proposed work will support curricular innovation by integrating cutting-edge bioinformatics research into classroom teaching in multiple undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>Arguably the most striking feature of eukaryotic nuclear gene expression is the ubiquity of RNA processing by the spliceosome, with most protein-coding transcripts undergoing splicing in the vast majority of characterized eukaryotic lineages.  Spliceosomes remove ubiquitous gene-interrupting sequences called introns, can facilitate the production of multiple products from the same gene by alternative splicing, and can produce novel products by splicing together of transcripts from different regions of the genome.  Despite the importance of splicing, almost nothing is known about splicing outside of a small number of model organisms.  This project will develop bioinformatic pipelines to leverage available genomic and transcriptomic data from 300 diverse eukaryotic species to advance knowledge of splicing across the eukaryotic domain.  Specifically, this project will advance understanding of form, function, mechanism and evolution of splicing by accomplishing three objectives: (i) the first domain-wide genome-wide characterization of eukaryotic cis- and trans- splicing events; (ii) the first domain-wide multi-level study of alternative splicing and trans-splicing; and (iii) the first domain-wide characterization and comparison of cis- and trans- factors involved in the mechanism of splicing.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences , the Division of Evolutionary Biology, and the Rules of Life Venture fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They utilize a common topological strategy of encircling one strand of duplex DNA to physically separate the duplex by coupled ATP hydrolysis, which results in separated single-strand DNA templates for leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. Earlier research in the field has focused on DNA contacts within the central channel of these helicases, while recently identified exterior contacts with the excluded DNA strand have largely remained unexplored. This project will assess the importance of external helicase contacts in controlling the speed of DNA replication through direct or indirect interactions with the excluded strand. Because a multitude of hexameric helicases across all domains of life will be compared for the nature of the interactions and the consequences of disrupting them, both in vitro and in vivo, the scientific scope and impact is expected to be broad and influential. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in techniques of single molecule fluorescence, advanced enzyme kinetics and precise genetic manipulation. Scientific outreach programs will encourage local elementary school students to explore the wonders of their own genome through ""DNA Days"" and engage students in electromagnetism by building their own working audio speakers.   <br/><br/>The mechanism of DNA unwinding by hexameric helicases during genome replication currently focuses solely on interactions with the encircled strand and overlooks the implication of contacts with the excluded strand. Preliminary work suggests that these external contacts could be more influential in controlling the speed of replication, coupling enzymes at the replication fork and sensing DNA damage. This project will interrogate and quantify precise chemical specificities of excluded strand interactions, and monitor mutational consequences on replisome speed, enzymatic coordination, and genomic stability, both in vitro and in vivo. The resulting data, methods, and findings will be broadly distributed within the scientific community and will provide further insights and comparisons into the precise mechanisms of action of hexameric helicases in DNA replication across all domains of life.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

They are also increasingly used in diverse applications in the biotechnology industry ranging from oil spill cleanup to vaccine delivery.  The structure and conformational dynamics (i.e. how their structure changes) of proteins are important properties that govern their function.  A critical step in altering or designing proteins with specific novel and desirable properties requires a detailed understanding of how the amino acid sequence of a protein codes for its structural and dynamical properties.  This project will test the idea that the patterning and separation of hydrophobic (water repelling) and electrically charged amino acids in the protein plays a significant role in modulating these properties.  A variety of spectroscopic techniques (using e.g. light and nuclear magnetic resonance) will be used to determine the changes in structure and stability of these proteins and variants of them that have been specially designed.  The experimental studies will be complemented by computer simulations to provide insights at the atomic level into the interplay between hydrophobic and electrical charge interactions.  The project aims to substantially advance our understanding of protein folding, one of  the most important and complex problems in biology.  A new venture into specially designed proteins will test the applicability of principles derived from studies of natural proteins and, it is hoped, will lead to new criteria for the design of proteins with novel and useful properties. This project will involve teaching and training of young scientists, which will be enhanced by active participation in the Protein Folding Consortium.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to test the contributions of local-in-sequence and long-range interactions, both in hydrophobic clusters of branched aliphatic side chains and between charged side chains in natural and designed beta/alpha-repeat proteins, in modulating the energy landscape of the proteins.  Available evidence on CheY, a naturally occurring protein, suggests that locally connected clusters of isoleucine, leucine and valine side chains rapidly collapse via subdomains that can enhance or impede subsequent folding reactions leading to the native conformation.  Recent work on Di-III_14, a de novo designed beta/alpha-repeat protein, suggests that long range electrostatic interactions with high charge segregation are responsible for the formation of very structured intermediates that interconvert extremely slowly with each other and with the native state.  The project will extend current knowledge of CheY and Di-III_14 proteins with a battery of spectroscopic methods, at equilibrium and interfaced to ultra-rapid mixing systems, to probe the size, shape and pair-wise distances in the chemically denatured state and in partially folded states that appear in the microsecond time range after dilution to native-favoring conditions.  Native-state hydrogen exchange experiments will explore the relationships between partially-folded states and sequence in Di-III_14 and other designed constructs. Mutational analysis will test the role of local and nonlocal ILV clusters and specific electrostatic interactions in the structures formed in high energy states of these proteins, and collaborative single molecule pulling experiments will be used to probe the unique energy surface of Di-III_14 in water. The experimental data will be used to validate collaborative high-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of the folding reactions of CheY and Di-III_14, and new design efforts by collaborators will test the role of charge and charge segregation in molding the free energy surface of beta/alpha-repeat proteins.  It is anticipated that the combined application of experimental, computational and design methods to the same targets will substantially enhance our understanding of how sequence determines folding and stability in one of the most common folds in proteins.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Its arrangement is fundamentally important for cell secretion, cell shape, growth, motility, and communication. Although the basic assembly of microtubules is well studied, very little is understood on how the array itself is organized. This is particularly important in multinucleated animal cells where multiple microtubule arrays are present and must maintain spatial separation so as not to interfere with each other. Establishing how these microtubule arrays are organized represents a fundamental challenge in understanding the basic organizational principles of eukaryotic cells. The preliminary data have identified multiple motor and cross-linker proteins that interact with microtubules and when deleted, result in broad alterations in array organization. The research plan is four fold: to understand at the cellular level where these effector proteins operate, to understand at the biochemical level how these effector proteins interact and function, to develop computational models that incorporate these activities and can predict/test understanding in multiple different scenarios, and to provide robust educational experiences to stimulate the next generation of scientists.  This project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates recruited from a local teaching college and through Wadsworth's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, will strengthen research ties with neighboring institutions in the Albany Capitol region, and develop a new working relationship with an expert computational modeler.

Results obtained from these two objectives will be fed into stochastic agent-based modeling efforts to build simulations that replicate the live cell results, inform whether the investigators need to consider alternate strategies and, importantly, enable prediction on how other microtubule arrays are organized in a broad range of organisms and strategies that are generally understudied in the biosciences.

Many proteins are capable of spontaneously folding from an extended chain into compact, functional machines. Once folded, proteins continue to undergo motions that are related to their stability  and function. Understanding the functional relevance of these motions remains extremely challenging because it is difficult to observe movement on the atomic scale and provide the necessary structural detail to connect these motions with a protein's function. The objectives of this project are 1) to develop powerful algorithms for simulating these protein motions, 2) apply these algorithms to understand how proteins fold, and 3) to combine these algorithms with biochemical experiments to design proteins that are more stable than their natural counterparts. Completion of this research will lay the foundation for future efforts to understand the role of protein motions in processes like cellular communications and to design proteins for applications such as the synthesis of biofuels. In concert with these research objectives, the PI will develop a python programming boot camp to teach students in biology the basic programming skills required to analyze their own data, providing a starting point for more sophisticated integration of computation and experiments and opening new job opportunities in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>This project will identify general properties of  free energy landscapes of proteins from simulation datasets created with specialized hardware and leverage them to empower similar studies with commodity hardware. This work will be guided by the hypothesis that leveraging ideas from optimization theory regarding exploration/exploitation tradeoffs will allow efficient conformational searches. Based on preliminary analyses, the PI's lab has already begun to prototype a new algorithm, referred to as fluctuation amplification of specific traits, or FAST. Further developing this algorithm, demonstrating its power, and disseminating it to the broader scientific community will lay a foundation for understanding and designing protein's conformational ensembles. Specific goals include: 1) develop the fluctuation amplification of specific traits (FAST) algorithm to efficiently explore a protein's conformational space, 2) test whether FAST can fold proteins, and 3) test whether FAST can reveal opportunities for designing stabilized proteins without perturbing their functions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

These compartments resemble liquid droplets. They are known as membraneless organelles and they perform different functions in different types of cells. They collect different types of molecules and form in different locations within cells. An example of a specific membraneless organelle is one that collects key protein and RNA molecules to assist in the formation of connections in the brain. This is essential for learning and the development of memories. Distinct protein molecules drive the formation of distinct membraneless organelles. In some cases, the identities of the relevant proteins are known. It is also known that membraneless organelles form by processes known as phase separation, which are similar to processes that lead to the separation of oil from vinegar. Research in this project will uncover the relationships between specific proteins and the physical and chemical interactions that lead to the formation of membraneless organelles via phase separation. This research is important because membraneless organelles control a variety of cellular functions that can go wrong and give rise to diseases. The research will use computations that combine physics and chemistry to answer biologically relevant questions. The research will also fuel the development of specific instruction modules, which will be used in the INSPIRE program at Washington University.

This process is mediated by proteins. LacY is one of such proteins and it is involved in  the transport of lactose and protons. LacY operates in a manner typical of membrane proteins that catalyze transport against a concentration gradient (i.e. active transport).  In this process, in the presence of a proton motive force, downhill transport of the protons is used by LacY to drive uphill concentration of sugar against a gradient. The aim of this project is to understand precisely how this coupled mechanism works. The PI has obtained LacY crystal structures at the atomic level, and biochemical/spectroscopic studies show that sugar- and proton-binding sites gain alternating access to either side of the membrane as the result of reciprocal opening and closing of cavities on either side of LacY. This proposal will investigate structural aspects of LacY at different states of the transport cycle by using crystallographic approaches. This project will also provide training to undergraduate students and research associates by directly involving them in experimental aspects of the research. <br/><br/>The aim of this research is to develop an atomic-level understanding of the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport by the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY), a paradigm for the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), the largest family of membrane transport proteins. Members of the MFS are found in the membranes of all living cells. However, despite an increasing number of X-ray structures of MFS members, including 7 of LacY from the PI's laboratory, as well as the quantitative demonstration that lactose/H+ symport is driven thermodynamically by chemiosmosis, the mechanism of this chemiosmotic process is not completely understood. Thus, it has been demonstrated that galactoside binding to highly dynamic protonated LacY triggers a global conformational change in which sugar- and proton-binding sites gain alternating access to either side of the membrane, while the proton electrochemical gradient accelerates the rate of deprotonation, but has no effect on alternating access. Therefore, LacY behaves like an enzyme except that the transition state(s) involves the protein rather than the substrate. X-ray structures of LacY inward- and almost occluded outward-facing conformations provide the structural basis for studying the alternating access mechanism. The PI plans to study the alternating access mechanism by applying pre-steady state kinetics, as well as multiple biochemical and spectroscopic approaches, and by using kinetic data obtained in real time for several steps in the transport cycle. The PI plans to determine whether the findings regarding the effects of electrochemical gradient are generalized by determining whether exchange and counterflow are affected by this gradient with other MFS symporters. This research also focuses on the use of thirty-one camelid nanobodies to stabilize LacY in different intermediate states to be studied by X-ray diffraction.

It is thought that such interactions have a role in the killing of bacteria by certain anti-bacterial proteins. They may also play an important role in the death of human cells during amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The importance of membrane protein interactions extends beyond biology and the templating of specific structures via interactions with membranes has applications in bio-inspired materials. High resolution molecular level studies of the interactions of proteins with membranes could lead to the design of better anti-bacterial agents and the development of novel materials. Unfortunately, investigators have been forced to use relatively crude mimics of biological membranes that do not capture critical aspects of natural cell membranes. In particular, natural cell membranes are asymmetric in the sense that the inside layer of the membrane has a different composition than the outside layer. This effect has important consequences for their behavior. This project will exploit recent technical breakthroughs to study the interactions of a representative member of an important class of human proteins with realistic asymmetric model membranes. The research will provide an unprecedented high resolution view of how proteins interact with biological membranes and induce cell death. The project includes significant efforts devoted to training the next generation of STEM students including initiatives designed to increase undergraduate participation in research and to promote women in the STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The project will define the principles of membrane-catalyzed aggregation of intrinsically disordered polypeptides (IDPs) using biologically relevant asymmetric membranes with a focus on the amyloidogenic polypeptide IAPP. The aggregation of polypeptides on membranes is a general feature of amyloid fiber formation and likely plays a role in the function of certain anti-microbial polypeptides. Unfortunately, existing model membranes are very poor mimics of the relevant plasma membranes. This has hindered biophysical studies of membrane induced self-assembly and membrane activity, making it exceptionally challenging to connect high resolution biophysical studies with the situation in vivo. This project will use asymmetric membranes with physiologically relevant lipid composition and cholesterol together with new methods to probe protein aggregation at high resolution. IAPP is chosen as a model system because it is broadly representative of amyloid formation by IDPs and because of the wealth of biochemical, biophysical and biological data available for this system. The principles that emerge from the research will be applicable to a wide range of systems including other amyloidogenic proteins and anti-microbial peptides.

Strikingly, the onset of DNA replication is assumed to coincide with achievement of a specific cell mass (critical mass), a phenomenon that is independent of growth rate. This was one of the most important quantitative ideas in the field of bacterial physiology during the 1950s and the 1960s, and it still serves as the foundation for our current understanding of cell cycle control. Surprisingly, however, we do not yet understand how the molecular-level regulation controls the global relationship between growth and cell cycle. To this end, this project will employ state-of-the-art microscopy to visualize replication and cell division machinery in living cells, allowing us to precisely measure cell growth, DNA replication and cell division timing. In particular, the project will study how the cell responds to physiological perturbations at the single-cell level. Single-cell approach is important, because we can acquire critical molecular-level information related to intracellular fluctuations that is inevitably lost in population-level studies. Importantly, this project will employ two evolutionarily divergent model organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, permitting us to determine which aspects of cell cycle regulation are likely to be broadly conserved. In doing so, this project will provide a definitive answer to the fundamental question of whether or not cells grow to a critical cell mass to initiate a specific cell-cycle event.<br/>     The strength of this research lies in its ability to bridge the gap between experiment and theory. In addition to the experimental component described above, the theory component involves quantitative modeling of the acquired data to make experimentally testable predictions. The outcome of the research will have implications for our fundamental understanding of the growth of all cells.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>     Quantitative biology is more than adding numbers to what biologists already know. The power of the approach is to bring quantitative rigor from physical sciences to identify and solve important and interesting problems in biology. As part of the new initiative of quantitative biology at the University of California at San Diego, the project aims to spread the culture of quantitative approaches to biology from K12 to graduate level education in the San Diego area. This integrative project places great emphasis on the importance of interdisciplinary research experiences at the undergraduate level. To inspire not only the students and educators but also the general public, an annual summer interdisciplinary research bootcamp will be offered for undergraduate students, and possibly senior high-school students, in the San Diego area.  Students from under-represented minority groups will be particularly encouraged to participate, and a Hispanic Serving Institution (San Diego State University) will collaborate in the project. A former instructor from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Courses joins the project to design and co-teach the bootcamp modules that incorporate molecular biology, quantitative microscopy, microfluidics, and image analysis. The overall goal is to design exemplary undergraduate research modules and integrate them into standard undergraduate research curricula in quantitative biology at UCSD, SDSU, and other universities.<br/><br/>     This award is cofounded by the programs in Cellular Dynamics and Function and the Physics of Living Systems."

Often these signals are in opposition; for example, one signal on its own might lead to growth, another to death.  When both signals are simultaneously present, the cell needs to integrate two pieces of information to make a single decision.  Currently, there is little understanding of how the integration of multiple inputs is achieved, but it is key to predicting the behavior of cells in complex environments.  For yeast, a well-known example of multiple signaling is that of the presence of mixtures of the two sugars glucose and galactose.  The textbook description of the integration event is simple:  glucose signaling dominates over galactose signaling.  This project will test a hypothesis challenging that description - for a broad range of concentrations, the response is far more complex, and involves a novel ""ratio-sensor"" mechanism.  The mechanism would make it possible for the cell to opt for ""the best of both"" rather than being limited to ""all or none"".  Establishing the existence of such flexibility in yeast responsiveness to sugar mixtures has far-reaching implications, in that it may extend to any number of other trade-off situations between two conflicting physiological or evolutionary objectives where the optimal decision would depend on the relative levels of a plurality of signals.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Many institutions have highlighted the need to introduce quantitative, theoretical and computational approaches into the life sciences mainstream.  In response to that need, an initiative has been undertaken to develop an integrated quantitative curriculum for life scientists, beginning with a quantitative ""bootcamp"".  The bootcamp has been extremely well received and materials have been used at other institutions around the world; within the next year a series of modules derived from the bootcamp will be made available via Harvard's online course offerings, HarvardX.  The present project will generate data and conceptual approaches that will be used as examples in the bootcamp, and also in other curricula to be developed that will teach, hand-in-hand, experimental design, visualization, and quantitative and analysis methods."

Focusing on regulatory proteins that dictate which genes are expressed in each cell (among the large repertoire of >20,000 human genes), this project will decipher mechanisms that allow similar proteins to interact with distinct regions of the genome in order to perform distinct functions. This is significant because most human proteins, including the transcription factors studied in this project, are closely-related members of large families. Over time, these proteins diversified in function, often with little change in the protein sequence. Our understanding of how closely-related transcription factors can bind to different regions of the genome is very limited. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will generate high-quality transcription factor-DNA binding data and models, and will analyze the data to study genetic mechanisms by which transcription factors target specific genomic regions. The data and models will be made available to the scientific community, and are expected to become a valuable resource for future studies of differences among related transcription factors. This research will expose postdoctoral fellows, graduate, undergraduate, high school, and middle school students to the genetic mechanisms used by human cells to regulate gene expression. Trainees will participate in data generation and analysis, as well as dissemination of results. Thus, they will be introduced to molecular and computational biology through practical studies of protein-DNA interactions. Trainees will also experience the power of interdisciplinary research, as they will combine computational modeling and biological experiments to address fundamental questions about human cells. In addition, by using biological questions as motivation to teach computational techniques, this project aims to attract female students of various age groups to STEM fields.<br/><br/>Interactions between proteins and DNA are critical for many cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. This project focuses on how closely-related transcription factor proteins identify their unique DNA binding sites across the human genome, in order to regulate the expression of target genes. Interactions between transcription factors and DNA occur over short regions, oftentimes <10 nucleotides. However, the DNA binding sites always occur within a specific genomic context, which is very likely to influence the interactions with transcription factors. This project will investigate three mechanisms by which genomic context can influence binding of closely-related factors: homotypic clustering (i.e. the presence of additional binding sites for factors from the same protein family), heterotypic clustering (i.e. the presence of binding sites for factors from other families), and the presence of repetitive DNA sequence elements (which were recently shown to affect protein-DNA binding). The project will use high-throughput cell-free assays to quantitatively measure the binding levels of 21 human transcription factors (from 9 distinct proteins families) for tens of thousands of DNA sites in their native genomic sequence contexts. For each protein family, DNA sequences with different arrangements of binding sites and different repeat elements will be selected from the human genome and synthesized de novo on glass slides. Binding of related transcription factors to the selected genomic sequences will be measured quantitatively, on the slides, using genomic-context protein-binding microarray (gcPBM) assays. gcPBM data are quantitative, highly reproducible, and can detect differences in binding between closely related factors, which makes the gcPBM assay ideal for this project. The generated data will be used to develop computational models of protein-DNA binding specificity, and to identify differences in specificity between related factors. All models will take into account characteristics of the genomic context (homotypic clustering, heterotypic clustering, and repetitive DNA elements). The models will be validated computationally and experimentally. Finally, the project will assess the extent to which different mechanisms can explain differential genomic binding in the cell. By identifying genetic mechanism that contribute to the differential DNA binding of closely-related transcription factors, this project represents a significant step forward in understanding how these regulatory proteins select distinct genomic targets and perform distinct functions in human cells."

The ways we maintain computer data today may cost a lot of money and energy (especially cooling); also, the materials on which the files are written are not too stable - they get spoiled with time, so that data may be eventually lost as a matter of few decades. To solve this issue, a new technology of writing and reading digital data in the molecular strings will be developed, based on DNA, the molecules from which the genetic code is also made. All living cells rely on DNA molecules for storing the instructions to run our cells and tissues, and these molecules are more stable than magnetic tape or paper. If successful, this DNA-based storage of computer data would readily retain all of the world`s current electronic data.<br/><br/>To develop a DNA-based data storage technology, a coding scheme that can reliably write and read back data in segments of DNA is proposed. One approach will involve the use of combinatorial molecular barcodes for addressing and random access, to generate the data blocks as well. Synthesis schemes to write long segments of DNA will be employed, where millions of such segment will be generated in parallel. Longer segments allow one to divide large files into fewer segments and thus require shorter index and random access barcodes. The use of nanopore DNA sequencers that generate long sequences will permit reading this data. Sophisticated mathematical coding techniques will be utilized to robustly reconstruct such a written message after accounting for errors specific to the write and read platforms, with a special emphasis on using nanopore technology. The coding techniques are tailored to the higher error rates in nanopore sequencing, which is the most promising for a scalable sequencing scheme. A DNA storage simulator will also be developed, that will allow researchers to model specific application needs, using predefined or custom error models for DNA write and read platforms and a variety of coding models for addresses and data. This will allow the trade-offs between cost, robustness and efficiency to be simulated at data scales from Gigabytes to Exabytes. Several cohorts of students will be trained in the field on the interface of genetics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and coding theory in the course of the proposed work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will be an open network that aims to draw in a broad cross-section of the US and international Arabidopsis communities. Arabidopsis research is at a critical junction; a broad range of new data types are becoming available, and the community?s ability to address important questions depends on the integration, visualization and analysis of these data. Diverse research groups are inventing new informatics approaches and thus the community needs a mechanism by which to identify, explore, promote, and enhance these resources. This project will catalyze a radical change in the way in which US and international researchers coordinate data generation, analysis and visualization. This project has the following goals: 1) The development of standards for Arabidopsis data deposition and display, 2) Development of a plan to develop Arabidopsis informatics tools and resources for the US and international communities, 3) Establishment of an International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium that will build upon the activities and resources that will be generated in this project, 4) Establishment of a website as a resource for interested scientists and the general public. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Through the coordination of Arabidopsis informatics efforts, this project will advance plant biology, create novel opportunities for research and education, and lead to the establishment and growth of an International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium. The problems that the Arabidopsis community is facing today will also challenge other communities, and this type of coordinated international approach to leveraging informatics resources across borders should provide an example (and resources) for such communities. Experiences learned from this application will have a broad impact across biology, particularly for crop plants for which a similar expansion in data is occurring and which often can build on efforts pioneered in Arabidopsis.

This research will generate understanding of physiologically relevant cell migration behaviors, which are responsible for orchestrating the formation of multicellular organisms. Because cells interact directly and constantly with their surroundings to create movement, migration is context dependent. However, cell motility has historically been studied in two-dimensional (2D) environments. The Principal Investigator (PI) discovered that cells display different migration behaviors in 3D environments that are more physiological. This project will address the fundamental question: How do 3D environmental cues give rise to distinct migration behaviors? The PI will employ a new process for creating 3D environments, a new integrated microscopic imaging technique and advanced computational biology approaches to develop a predictive, quantitative model of how cells move in three dimensions through a synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM). Such a model has the potential to advance our basic understanding of cell motility, which is a critical aspect of eukaryotic development.  The project will additionally provide research training opportunities for graduate students and experience-based educational projects on multi-scale systems analysis and career education for high school and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>In 3D spaces like bodily tissues, it is generally accepted that the coordination of four local processes (adhesion, cytoskeletal polymerization, contractility, and matrix remodeling) dictate global motility behaviors. Yet, no quantitative framework has been developed to link these localized processes to global cell behaviors. Such a framework would represent a generalized platform for both studying and engineering cell motility, where any signal input (chemical exciter/inhibitor, physical cue, etc.) could be quantified by its effect on these processes to predict the resulting motility behavior output. Historically, motility models have been formulated using a bottom-up approach, where theoretical physical and kinetic equations are fitted to observations. These approaches have advanced the understanding of local processes of motility on 2D planar surfaces. However, mathematical, computational, and experimental limitations have prevented their full extension to physiologically relevant 3D cell motility. The top-down approach used in this project overcomes current limitations to immediately address a fundamental question: How can subcellular molecular processes be connected with the geometry and translocation of the whole cell in a 3D ECM? The goal of this project is to integrate knowledge across three scales of cell motility, extracellular, sub-cellular, and cellular, by taking a data-driven systems approach. In Aim 1, the PI will develop a microfluidic device that will enable highly controlled, systematic variation of ECM matrix properties and high-throughput analysis of their regulatory role in cell migration. Aim 2 will combine into a single platform a time-lapse cell tracking assay and quantitative molecular imaging techniques, which the PI previously developed for measuring the four core motility processes within cells in a 3D ECM. This platform will allow the analysis of single-cell motility at an integrated systems level for the first time. In Aim 3, the PI will apply machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to the single-cell data generated in Aim 2 to develop a predictive framework for emergent 3D cell motility."

Watersheds can become contaminated with Escherichia via treated sewage, livestock farming, wild animals, fowl, and sediment runoff from urban and agricultural environments. Several studies revealed that Escherichia may adapt and persist in these environments, and eventually may be able to pass the genes for new traits to host-associated strains such as Escherichia coli.  In addition to examining this idea, the data from this study will allow the broader scientific community to evaluate existing water quality monitoring methods. The research for this project will be integrated into authentic research experiences for undergraduate students in STEM fields through course-based research experiences (CREs).  In particular, undergraduates in first year and upper level laboratories will actively participate in all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two related scientific goals: 1) characterizing genomic diversity of environmentally derived Escherichia isolates to understand variation in naturally occurring populations over time; and 2) linking profiles of 16S community surveys to observed variation in Escherichia isolate genomes and to environmental changes in a watershed. Remarkable genetic diversity has been characterized by global studies of E. coli through analysis of representative fully sequenced genomes, and targeted studies of pathogen sub-types through hundreds of draft genome sequences of clinical isolates. The preponderance of genomic data is from clinical and host-associated environments. This project produces 720 draft genome sequences of environmentally derived Escherichia isolates. The longitudinal data enable testing hypotheses about genome structure and genetic exchange in naturally occurring, non-host-associated populations through comparative genomics of genome content, arrangement and single nucleotide polymorphisms. The data address long term persistence of Escherichia populations in non-host environments, potentially serving as reservoirs for genetic exchange and renewal of fecal indicator bacteria in bodies of water. Oligotyping will estimate diversity in the Escherichia populations; water samples will produce coupled isolate genome sequences and microbial community 16S rRNA sequences. It is asserted that single nucleotide changes in 16S rRNA represent diversity of genome structure; the data will be used to test this assertion. Fine scale sampling produces longitudinal 16S rRNA microbial community profiles used to understand changes in Escherichia and other microbial populations. Work linking 16S rRNA variation to genome variation enables prediction of population changes based on 16S rRNA surveys alone. High quality recreational and drinking water sources are essential for society, and as water quality monitoring shifts to molecular based approaches, the types of datasets produced here become critical to ascertaining effective and broadly applicable monitoring techniques. A third goal fully incorporates undergraduate students in STEM fields through individual and course-based research experiences (CREs). Over 100 students in courses will gain first-hand knowledge of authentic research. The effectiveness of these experiences will be assessed through convergent mixed methods approaches designed to gauge student attitudes toward STEM fields, comparing effects of individual research experiences and CREs on first year and upper level students."

Sequencing will be done on 100 MA lines derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been assessed for performance in six natural field environments. Additional sequencing will include 40 lines from each of 8 additional sets of MA lines, established from naturally-collected founder genotypes from France and Sweden, and 50 lines from natural North American selections that have been identified to contain a unique haplotype grouping and divergence pattern of mutations similar to that found in classical MA lines. These data will estimate with much greater accuracy the type and rates of spontaneous mutation at the sequence level and will allow the research team to decompose the spectrum of mutations and connect them to field performance. <br/><br/>The synthesis of these datasets will enable the determination of which types of mutations are more likely to be beneficial, deleterious or neutral, and whether the effects of certain types of identified mutations are consistent across environments. There are societal, scientific and educational broader impacts to improving our understanding of mutations in plants.

These molecules participate in transmitting signals, for example recruiting immune cells to the sites of inflammation, and are critical to the development and maintenance of tissues. The mechanical forces that these proteins feel when they bind to their targets can dramatically alter their behavior, controlling how long the bond endures before breaking. In many cases this regulation is counterintuitive, with larger tension leading to longer bond lifetimes, and the underlying microscopic mechanisms are poorly understood. This project aims to investigate those mechanisms through theory and computations, creating general methods for analyzing experimental data that will elucidate the molecular details of adhesion in a variety of biological contexts. The focus will be on protein heterogeneity-the diverse structural states which adhesion bonds can assume, each with its own characteristic response to applied forces. The project will integrate cutting-edge biophysics research into undergraduate education through the BIOREPS (BIOphysical REsearch Problem Set) initiative. Students in an undergraduate biophysics course will transform recent high-profile research articles into problem sets published in an open online database. These activities will give students valuable experience in scientific pedagogy and communication. The resulting database will become a unique resource, available to all educators looking for research-based course materials. <br/><br/>This project's research strategy is based on the following hypothesis: the regulation of adhesion protein bonds by tension can be explained by characterizing their heterogeneous conformational states, and resolving how the protein switches between states under various force conditions. This project will identify and describe the multiple conformational states of the bonds directly from data gathered by single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments. This project will develop new theoretical approaches that bridge the divide between experimental measurements and the microscopic mechanisms of adhesion to overcome the challenge of deciphering the molecular details from the data. This project will also develop structure-based models that relate observable bond dynamics in specific systems to tension-induced changes in protein configuration and bond energies. Parallel focus on data analysis and model development provides a comprehensive framework for discovery, drawing on the mutual feedback between experiment and theory. The research will provide direct insights into adhesion, but also aid the development of new and more informative experimental protocols."

However, it is still rare for synthetically modified strains to meet the production requirement for commercialization. Strain development falls into the tedious and costly design-build-test-learn cycle because existing modeling approaches failed to capture the complicated metabolic responses in such engineered cells. This proposal will explore an alternate, data-driven approach that has the potential to predict the productivity of synthetic organisms by leveraging the vast array of microbial cell factory publications. Using Artificial Intelligence approaches such as Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation, one can abstract ""previous lessons'' hidden in published data to facilitate a priori estimations of the metabolic output by engineered hosts given a set of specific genetic instructions and fermentation growth conditions. The resulting platform can assist current constraint-based models to design the most effective strategies for producing value-added chemicals. On the educational front, this proposal will offer educational and research training opportunities in synthetic biology, computer programming, and artificial intelligence for graduate students to provide them with a non-conventional career pathway. <br/><br/>Synthetic biology relies on extensive genetic modification and pathway engineering, which often result in unexpected physiological changes or metabolic shifts that reduce the productivity and stability of the hosts. The investigators conceived of a creative, multidisciplinary approach that relies on artificial intelligence-inspired methods for predicting the performance of two distinct unicellular cell factories (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These platforms can be used to quantify the factors that govern microbial productivity (yield, titer, and growth rate), including the type and availability of metabolic precursors; the elements that constitute a biosynthetic pathway; fermentation conditions; and the specific genetic modification to optimize the system. By extracting and classifying information derived from referenced publications within the last 20 years, one can construct a ''knowledge base'' containing sufficient samples of bio-production assemblies. This information will then inform the building of cellular factories using supervised machine learning and non-monotonic logic programming to estimate the productivity of hosts. The data-driven platform will also be integrated into genome scale models to project physiological changes of specific mutant strains. This novel approach will reduce the need for costly design-build-test bench work. Key outcomes from this project include: (1) a database to standardize synthetic biology studies, (2) machine learning models to recognize lessons and patterns hidden in published data, and (3) integration of machine learning with flux balance models, leading to the design of strains with high chances of success in industry settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

BR pathways are well conserved among Arabidopsis and crop plants such as maize, rice and other crops, so the knowledge obtained from the proposed studies can be used to design strategies to optimize plant growth and crop production under drought conditions. Moreover, the project provides excellent training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral associates in modern plant biology. The investigators will also achieve societally relevant outcomes by providing training opportunities to underrepresented undergraduates through the George Washington Carver Internship program as well as engaging high school and community college teachers via summer internships. Through this partnership with teachers a learning module on BR-regulation of plant growth will be developed for high-school and community college students. Furthermore, unpublished data from the proposed studies will be incorporated into an upper level undergraduate course on functional genomics, systems, and network biology, freeing students to generate their own hypotheses during a group project rather than simply reproducing published work. Finally, the investigators will provide resources to the research community by organizing a workshop on plant phenomics, proteomics and computational modeling approaches and by making the data generated publicly accessible through publications and the Principal Investigator's laboratory website.<br/><br/>Molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis have greatly advanced our understanding of the BR signaling pathway. BRs signal to regulate BES1/BZR1 family transcription factors (TFs), hundreds of BR-Related Transcription Factors (BR-TFs) and thousands of target genes. Although numerous BR-TFs have been identified, the transcriptional complexes that allow BES1/BZR1 and these BR-TFs to regulate the large number of BR-responsive genes have not been characterized. In addition, modeling of BR networks has proven to be a powerful approach to understand how BES1 directs a network controlling thousands of BR responsive genes. However, previously constructed BR networks have only considered transcription, overlooking important regulation at the post-transcriptional and post-translational level. The project will use an integrated genetics, genomics, and proteomics approach to establish and experimentally test a comprehensive Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) governing BR-regulated growth and drought responses. By combining cutting-edge proteomics with advanced predictive modeling the project will generate a comprehensive view of BR-mediated transcriptional regulation and allow for the identification of novel factors involved in BR responses. First, investigators will uncover the components and functions of BR transcription factor complexes by examining the role of two novel BR-TFs. These two BR-TFs interact with BES1, a master regulator of the BR pathway, as well as a large number of other BR-TFs, likely forming large transcriptional complexes to control the expression of BR target genes. Second, investigators will generate BR transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome datasets that are a prerequisite for a novel approach pioneered by the Co-Principal Investigator to construct GRNs based on these combined omics data. These combined networks have increased predictive ability compared to networks based only on transcriptional data and will provide a vital resource, allowing for a more complete understanding of the transcriptional program through which BRs control plant growth and stress responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is still rare for synthetically modified strains to meet the production requirement for commercialization.  Strain development falls into the tedious and costly design-build-test-learn cycle because existing modeling approaches failed to capture the complicated metabolic responses in such engineered cells. This proposal will explore an alternate, data-driven approach that has the potential to predict the productivity of synthetic organisms by leveraging the vast array of microbial cell factory publications. Using Artificial Intelligence approaches such as Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation, one can abstract ""previous lessons'' hidden in published data to facilitate a priori estimations of the metabolic output by engineered hosts given a set of specific genetic instructions and fermentation growth conditions. The resulting platform can assist current constraint-based models to design the most effective strategies for producing value-added chemicals. On the educational front, this proposal will offer educational and research training opportunities in synthetic biology, computer programming, and artificial intelligence for graduate students to provide them with a non-conventional career pathway. <br/><br/>Synthetic biology relies on extensive genetic modification and pathway engineering, which often result in unexpected physiological changes or metabolic shifts that reduce the productivity and stability of the hosts. The investigators conceived of a creative, multidisciplinary approach that relies on artificial intelligence-inspired methods for predicting the performance of two distinct unicellular cell factories (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These platforms can be used to quantify the factors that govern microbial productivity (yield, titer, and growth rate), including the type and availability of metabolic precursors;  the elements that constitute a biosynthetic pathway; fermentation conditions; and the specific genetic modification to optimize the system. By extracting and classifying information derived from referenced publications within the last 20 years, one can construct a ''knowledge base'' containing sufficient samples of bio-production assemblies. This information will then inform the building of cellular factories using supervised machine learning and non-monotonic logic programming to estimate the productivity of hosts. The data-driven platform will also be integrated into genome scale models to project physiological changes of specific mutant strains. This novel approach will reduce the need for costly design-build-test bench work. Key outcomes from this project include: (1) a database to standardize synthetic biology studies, (2) machine learning models to recognize lessons and patterns hidden in published data, and (3) integration of machine learning with flux balance models, leading to the design of strains with high chances of success in industry settings."

This project will assemble the genomes of 26 additional maize lines, chosen to represent a broad cross section of the maize lines used in modern breeding. The sequence assemblies will be enhanced by adding information about the nature of the genes and how the genomes differ from each other. All information will be released on an accelerated schedule through public databases. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: Maize is an important crop and model organism for plant genetics. However, currently nearly all forms of sequence analysis are referenced to the single B73 inbred. Beyond B73, the most extensively researched maize lines are the core set of 25 inbreds known as the NAM founder lines, which represent a broad cross section of modern maize diversity. Prior data show that gene content can differ by more than 5% across lines and that as much as half of the functional genetic information lies outside of genes in highly variable intergenic spaces. To capture and utilize this variation, the NAM founder inbreds and a twenty-sixth line containing abnormal chromosome 10 will be sequenced and assembled using a mate-pair strategy. Scaffolds will be validated by BioNano optical mapping, and ordered and oriented using linkage data. RNA-seq data from multiple tissues will be used to annotate each genome, and assemblies and annotations will be released with genome browser support through MaizeGDB, NCBI, and Cyverse. Comparative genomic tools will be used to identify and to catalog the maize pangenome, and to assess the role of structural variation such as presence-absence variation and copy number variation in the determination of agronomic traits.

In cells, mRNA levels reflect a balance between synthesis and degradation.  Whereas, many studies have focused on mRNA synthesis, not many yet have centered on degradation. This research seeks to fill this gap as a way to obtain a more complete picture of how gene expression levels are controlled.  The experimental approaches will include analysis of large genomics data sets using statistical and mathematical modeling methods carried out in collaboration between biologists and mathematicians. Therefore the project will offer opportunities for both biology and math students to receive training in areas that are important for the workforce of tomorrow. The project will include individuals at many career stages, including postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduates, and a small team of high school students.  The high school students will work to develop apps that will allow the project data to be easily accessed by scientists, thus enhancing learning of high school students and making the obtained data easily accessible to the broader scientific community.  Laboratory personnel will also contribute to the REFUGES program at the University of Utah, which provides training to middle school students from the diverse refugee communities that live in Salt Lake City, Utah. <br/><br/>The research addresses mechanisms, specificity, and regulatory roles of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation (also known as decay). Using the plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model eukaryote, preliminary genome-wide studies revealed two intriguing findings that form the foundation of this project.  First, a study of mRNA decay rates, showed that mRNAs have half-lives ranging from less than four minutes to more than 24 hours. The mRNAs with the shortest half-lives tend to encode regulatory proteins, like transcription factors, and proteins that function in signaling, like protein kinases.  Moreover, the half-lives of these mRNAs are longer than normal in mutants that lack functional components of the RNA decay machinery. These results led to the hypothesis that mRNAs with high turnover rates might be regulated by a selective stabilization mechanism, perhaps modulated by phosphorylation of proteins involved in the decay machinery. Experiments will address this hypothesis by analyzing decay rates under different environmental conditions that induce rapid changes in phosphorylation, and testing whether phosphorylation of proteins known to participate in mRNA decay affects decay rates or association with other decay-associated protein subunits. The second preliminary observation to be pursued in this project is that the presence of specific codons in mRNAs affects the mRNA decay rates. This suggested that mRNA decay might occur in association with the process of protein synthesis, or translation. This idea will be tested by analyzing the effect of altered tRNA levels and by testing decay rates of mRNAs with altered codon use.  In addition, a direct search for mutants impaired in this process will be conducted to identify components of this translation-coupled decay pathway.  Together, the results of the research are expected to reveal novel insights into the process of mRNA decay and thereby provide a more comprehensive view of the factors that help balance mRNA levels in the cellular cytoplasm."

In the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, a special so-called B chromosome can induce elimination of all the genes inherited from the paternal parent, producing progeny that contain genes just from the mother's genome, along with the B chromosome itself. How this happens is not clear, but this research should provide important clues that might shed light on how selfish DNA elements promote their own propagation in this and other systems.  The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. Data generated by the project will be used for original research in a new module to be incorporated by the PI into his developmental biology course; the new course will provide the students with experience in both bioinformatics and fluorescence microscopy approaches. The course module will also be incorporated into the biology curricula of two-year colleges in the Los Angeles area. A scientific outcome of the collective efforts of students in these courses will be to establish a new gene expression resource for the research community. Educational outcomes of engaging students in research are expected to include:  increased student interest and conceptual understanding of scientific inquiry; higher rates of retention as biology majors; higher academic performance of two-year college students in subsequent upper-level biology courses; and enhanced rates of transfer of students from  two- to four-year institutions.    <br/><br/>Normally, all parts of the eukaryotic genome function in unison to insure normal organismal function. However, in some cases, individual chromosome regions and even whole chromosomes can alter normal reproductive processes in order to become transmitted at abnormally high levels to new progeny at the expense of the genome as a whole. Currently little is known about how this condition, known as intragenomic conflict, occurs at the molecular level. This project will employ modern molecular and cytological methods to investigate how a supernumerary (""extra"") B chromosome completely destroys the paternal genome in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis, thereby achieving near-perfect B chromosome transmission. Preliminary data suggest that genome elimination is targeted through a mechanism involving differences in the configuration of chromatin associated with the paternal vs. maternal genomes.  Experimental approaches will test this hypothesis as follows: (1) define how the B chromosome and the paternal genome differ in their chromatin states when the paternal genome undergoes elimination; (2) determine whether and how the B chromosome initially alters the chromatin state of the paternal genome; and (3) explore the role of novel B chromosome-expressed non-coding RNAs as potential effectors of paternal genome elimination. This research will provide insights into unknown aspects of chromatin dynamics, address whether genome elimination by the selfish B element is mechanistically distinct from genome elimination events in other organisms, and help to discern how intragenomic conflict can arise from a functionally unified genome."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Deleterious mutations are generally understood to cause negative effects by disrupting what the mutated protein was originally supposed to do.  However, the deleterious effects of mutations might also arise from causing the mutated protein to do things it should not do, such as interfere with unrelated biological process. These are known as collateral effects. Very little is known about the extent to which mutations cause deleterious effects by the latter mechanism.  In this research, the investigators will comprehensively quantify the collateral effects of mutations in two antibiotic resistance proteins and uncover mechanisms for the mutational effects. This will contribute to the understanding of how proteins evolve and the mechanisms by which mutations can affect the physiology of the cell, which is important for understanding normal biological function as well as human disease and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Each year of this research, two graduate students, two undergraduates, and one high school student will be trained in research.  The graduate students will attend scientific conferences to present their research and gain mentorship experience supervising the undergraduate and high school students.   <br/><br/>Collateral fitness effects of mutations are those effects which do not derive from changes in the ability of the gene/protein to perform its physiological functions. The contribution of collateral fitness effects of mutations to protein evolution is unknown. In this research, collateral fitness effects of all single missense mutations and all single-codon insertion/deletion mutations in two antibiotic resistance proteins will be measured using a combination of large scale mutagenesis, growth competition, and deep sequencing technology. The data will also be used to identify mutations to test hypotheses of the mechanisms behind collateral fitness effects.  For example, since protein evolution rates anti-correlate with protein expression levels, one possibility is that deleterious collateral fitness effects occur when mutations cause the protein to misfold or misinteract with other proteins. Very little is known about the frequency, magnitude, and mechanisms of collateral fitness effects, but such information is critical for understanding the distribution and origins of fitness effects of mutations and interpreting the rates of protein evolution. The systematic and comprehensive study of such effects in two proteins will generate a wealth of data from which to understand the contribution of collateral fitness effects to the distribution of fitness effects of mutations and to protein evolution rates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use biochemical and genetic approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate how a specific protein enzyme, known as GSNOR, controls the amount and effects of NO in plants. Results will contribute to our overall understanding of the mechanism of NO action in all organisms. One postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, two undergraduates and a middle school teacher will receive training in laboratory research, as well as mentoring in written and oral communication of scientific data for specialist and lay audiences.

The engagement with Amherst schools will also serve the important goal of strengthening community ties with the university.<br/><br/>Despite the clear involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in multiple plant processes, including germination, root growth and fertility, a basic understanding of the mechanisms by which NO exerts its effects on systems critical for plant growth and development is lacking and will be addressed in this project. The cellular signaling and regulatory effects of NO are mediated by reversible, posttranslational protein redox modifications, including cysteine (Cys) nitrosation (Cys-SNO) and glutathionylation (Cys-SG). These reversible, covalent modifications result primarily from reaction with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a soluble NO-adduct of the abundant cellular redox buffer glutathione. They can have major effects on protein activity, indicating there must be mechanisms to control NO and GSNO concentrations in both time and space within cells. This project investigates how the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) plays a major role in modulating GSNO and protein nitrosation levels. A model for regulation of GSNOR activity by nitrosation of specific Cys residues has been developed from biochemical studies of Arabidopsis, yeast and human GSNOR. This project will test this model both in vitro (Aim 1) and in vivo in Arabidopsis thaliana (Aim 2) using biochemistry and genetics, and possible regulation of GSNOR activity by other posttranslational modifications will be investigated. Experiments will also determine how GSNOR nitrosation is reversed by specific cytosolic redox proteins in the thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase families (Aims 1 and 2). Results will develop a complete picture of the possible redox modifications controlling GSNOR activity and thereby cellular NO levels, and provide novel data on the activity and specificity of cytosolic thioredoxins. Finally, changes in protein nitrosation associated with the reduced fertility of Arabidopsis GSNOR null mutants will be determined by novel mass spectrometry methods (Aim 3). In total, experiments address how mechanisms controlling activity of a single enzyme (GSNOR) are propagated to result in phenotypic changes at the whole organism level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Defects in cell division have been linked to developmental anomalies and various afflictions. The final stage of cell division is cytokinesis, where the two daughter cells are physically partitioned. Successful cytokinesis requires multiple steps that are precisely controlled both in time and space. The nature and molecular details of this precise regulation is poorly understood. This project aims at understanding how this complex multi-step process is precisely controlled to ensure successful cell separation. Cytokinesis is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and hence what is learned in yeast is directly applicable to mammals (such as humans). One of the best model systems to study cell division and cytokinesis is the fission yeast. Preliminary work using the fission yeast model system has, with great clarity, revealed the mechanistic details of the early stages of cytokinesis. Unraveling the molecular details in cytokinesis in the fission yeast will provide a paradigm to study similar processes in complex organisms and will lead to a better understanding of the etiology of various anomolies related to cytokinesis. <br/><br/>Cytokinesis, the final step in cell division, is central to survival and development of all cells. Cytokinesis is a temporally organized multistep process that involves the physical separation of a cell into two. First, an actomyosin ring forms, which then undergoes constriction concurrent with septum ingression for membrane furrow formation. It is not clear how these events are temporally organized. In fission yeast, septum ingression is critical for membrane furrow formation. The ingressing septum provides the force required to overcome internal turgor pressure in the cell. It is not clear how actomyosin ring constriction and septum ingression occur concurrently. Membrane furrowing can occur without an actomyosin ring so what role does the actomyosin ring play in cytokinesis?  Ring constriction and septum ingression occurs after a short waiting period, post ring assembly. What triggers the onset of ring constriction and septum formation? Preliminary data shows that post-ring assembly, the conserved GTPase Cdc42 is activated in a unique spatiotemporal manner. Cdc42 activation pattern during cytokinesis depends on the localization of its activators, Gef1 and Scd1.  Gef1 promotes the recruitment of a septum synthesizing protein at the ring to allow timely onset of ring constriction and septum ingression, while Scd1 is required for normal septum formation. Gef1 also promotes uniform ring constriction and septum ingression. Based on this data the proposed central hypothesis is that spatiotemporal activation of Cdc42 enables the assembled actomyosin ring to act as a landmark and guide for proper ring constriction and septum formation. To test this, the following aims will be pursued; 1. To define how Cdc42 is spatiotemporally activated at the division site post ring assembly; 2. To determine how ring constriction and septum formation is promoted by spatiotemporal activation of Cdc42; and 3. To describe how the actomyosin ring acts as a landmark and guide for symmetric ring constriction and septum formation. This project will integrate live cell imaging, analysis of protein dynamics, genetics, and mathematical modeling. This project will provide a deeper understanding of how unique Cdc42 activation patterns are established, leading to distinct functions in cytokinesis and will provide insights into how signaling patterns organize complex multistep processes in the cell. This project will have widespread implications in the mechanistic understating of cytokinesis in most eukaryotes."

Hundreds of yeast genes are known to influence lifespan, but paradoxically, not a single gene can be claimed as a direct cause of aging. Different and even opposite pathways have been observed when experiments are performed in different ways. Despite the complexity of aging, the lifespan of many species can be extended by dietary restriction. This seemingly complicated picture and the evolutionarily conserved lifespan extension effect of dietary restriction will be addressed by the core idea of the study, that cellular aging is an emergent property of stochastic gene networks.  A probabilistic gene network model for cellular aging will be used to illustrate the conserved lifespan extension mechanism of dietary restriction in the model organism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and study how the organization and dynamics of the yeast gene networks will influence the aging process. The first objective is to test a hypothesis that dietary restriction extends lifespan by improving reliability of gene interaction through analyzing lifespan data of hundreds of yeast mutants.   The second objective is to further develop the theoretical foundation of the network model for cellular aging."

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) make up about a third of the proteins found in eukaryotic cells (cells of more complex organisms than bacteria), and are involved in many essential cellular processes, but as their name implies, their structures are not well defined.  In this project, the investigators will develop force fields, the physics based laws that describe how atoms interact with each other, that can be used for IDPs in MD simulations.  This work will contribute to understanding how IDPs contribute to the machinery of life. New MD force field parameters will be made publicly available such that others can use them in their simulations.  The interdisciplinary research will carried out by three graduate students who will gather expertise in MD, biophysics, physical and organic chemistry, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques. The project will foster an international collaboration among the laboratories of Profs. Urbanc (PI) and Schweitzer-Stenner (Co-PI) at Drexel University in Philadelphia and Harald Schwalbe at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Germany. PI and Co-PI will organize summer workshops on MD simulations of unfolded peptides at Drexel University and an effort will be made to attract students and faculty targeting underrepresented minorities from neighboring institutions to attend this event. The research outcomes will be featured through the annual Kaczmarczik Day event, which offers demonstrations of research conducted at the Physics and Chemistry Departments at Drexel University to the general public, mostly high school students from the local Philadelphia area. <br/><br/>Experimental research on unfolded peptides demonstrate that for most amino acid residues in water the backbone dihedral angles are restricted to two predominant regions in Ramachandran plot corresponding to polyproline II (pPII) and beta-strand. Of all amino acids, alanine shows the highest pPII propensity, which is important in the context of molecular dynamics (MD) force field development that routinely uses alanine-based short peptides as reference systems. Current MD force fields consistently fail to reproduce the high pPII content of alanine-based short peptides observed in vitro. The PIs and collaborators have acquired multiple experimental data for most naturally occurring guest residue x in GxG (G-glycine, x-all amino acids other than Q, G, P and W) peptides in water, which allowed them to uniquely determine residue-specific intrinsic conformational ensembles. This proposal will utilize this comprehensive set of experimental data to test the existing MD force fields and water models with respect to their ability to reproduce the conformational propensities of guest residues x in GxG peptides in water (Aim 1); derive a new parameterization of the existing MD force field, AMBER ff99SB, and combine it with the water model that best captures the intrinsic conformational propensities of guest residues x in GxG peptides to obtain the new force field AMBER ff99SB EXP-GxG (Aim 2); and conduct a systematic five-step assessment of the resulting AMBER ff99SB EXP-GxG force field that will test its transferability to longer unfolded peptides and its ability to capture protein folding and protein self-assembly into soluble protein oligomers (Aim 3).

A better understanding of how gene expression is regulated is fundamental to the process of plant engineering and hence to improved agricultural production.  Plants regulate gene expression at multiple levels and the aim of this project is to characterize proteins called endoribonucleases, which regulate gene expression at the level of mRNA degradation.  An important aspect of this project is to determine how these endoribonucleases impact the biology of plants, including plant growth and development.  This project will train young scientists on fundamental aspects of gene regulation.  The young scientist will receive interdisciplinary training through interactions with collaborators who are experts in systems biology and chemical engineering.  A Shadow a Scientist program will give middle school students the chance to meet scientists, tour a research laboratory, and to see experiments for this project in progress.  Other outreach activities aim to engage the public and to inspire scientific interest in people from a broad range of backgrounds and age groups.  <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the roles of ribonucleases (RNases) that participate in mRNA degradation in Arabidopsis.  Examining the roles of endoribonucleases in post-transcriptional control of genes is an underdeveloped area of research, but a timely one.  The hypothesis underlying this proposed research is that elucidating the targets and post-transcriptional impact of endoribonucleases will enhance our understanding of key players in plant mRNA decay, such as the exosome, as well as lesser known or putative endoribonucleases whose role is yet to be discovered.  To test this idea and others, the project will first create a set of double mutants to stabilize mRNA decay intermediates produced by endoribonucleases so they can be deeply sequenced; single endoribonuclease mutations will be introduced into an xrn4 null mutant background to achieve this.  Second, to identify substrates of the endoribonucleases, RNA decay intermediates and RNA levels will be analyzed on a global scale in the double mutants and controls using Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends and RNA-Seq data.  Should any of the endoribonucleases act on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) targets, that would be intriguing given that plants lack the metazoan NMD endoribonuclease, SMG6.  Third, new biological impacts of the endoribonucleases will be hypothesized and tested in the single mutants on the basis of the functional associations of their cleaved substrates.  Fourth, post-transcriptional mechanisms that involve the endoribonucleases will be investigated. Localization of the endoribonucleases, the identification of proteins interacting with them and other post-transcriptional data will refine phenotypic hypotheses and models.  Beyond making use of The Virtual Plant for this pursuit, this project will enhance its power with new post-transcriptional components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

In blood development, a single hematopoietic stem cell gives rise to about 12 distinct cell types. A hematopoietic cell's decision to choose between alternative lineages depends on both the internal state of the cell, defined by networks of lineage-specifying transcription factors, as well as external signals provided by small molecules called cytokines. Furthermore, the two systems, cytokine signaling and transcription factor networks, do not function independently of each other. This project aims to use a combination of computation and experiment to understand how the interaction between signaling and transcription factor networks controls cell-fate choice. This study will advance our understanding of cell-fate choice during blood differentiation and the insights will be relevant to other tissues and organisms. The computational tools developed during the course of research will have broad applicability in developmental biology. Educational activities aim to promote the development of the quantitative and modeling skills of biology students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This will be accomplished by 1) developing course modules based on the research activities and making them available to the teaching community and 2) mentoring undergraduate students in research projects. <br/><br/>Cell-autonomous gene regulatory networks and cell-extrinsic cytokine signaling have often times been viewed as competing and mutually-exclusive hypotheses for the specification of cell fate during hematopoiesis. The investigators propose instead that cell fate is an emergent property arising from interactions between cytokine signaling and gene regulatory networks. They will test this hypothesis with tightly coupled experimental and mathematical modeling activities. The research plan leverages a unique experimental tool; hematopoietic cells that can be inducibly differentiated along alternative lineages at a defined starting point to probe cytokine-transcription factor interactions in time. Aim 1 will infer the gene regulatory networks involved in the macrophage-neutrophil cell-fate decision de novo by measuring genome-wide expression at high temporal resolution and computing pair-wise mutual information. Aim 2 will build differential equation models of signaling effector/transcription factor networks to investigate how emergent dynamics are produced. The models will be predictive and allow the simulation of the effects of different cytokines and perturbations. While Aims 1 and 2 investigate the system dynamics at the network level, Aim 3 will determine how a core group of 13 transcription factor and cytokine receptor loci are regulated in time at the level of DNA sequence. Here, a novel experimental-computational approach for reverse engineering cis-regulatory module logic will be utilized to identify distal enhancers and silencers and determine how they are regulated. A comprehensive cis-regulatory module reporter library will be constructed and reporter activities will be measured in time. Time-resolved activity data will be used to constrain predictive sequence-based thermodynamic models of transcription to determine the transcription factors and protein-protein interactions regulating the modules. This study will use unique tools of the model system, time series data, and modeling to determine how gene regulatory networks process cytokine signals in a context-dependent manner. The models and reporter library will be a resource for a wide range of developmental biologists."

Although an apparently seamless process, previous work showed that segmentation slows down, then speeds up as the body elongates. Corresponding to this switch in rate, cells behave differently during early and late elongation stages. This work will build on those preliminary observations and, first, carefully describe the switch in how clusters of cells elongate and, second, investigate how it is controlled. This kind of discontinuity or switch in tissue elongation in a progressively elongating body axis is unusual and likely to provide insight into novel mechanisms of elongation. The research is a collaborative effort between a type 1 research university and a teaching college. A major impact of this work is to rigorously train undergraduates in interdisciplinary research, combining computer modeling of elongation with hands-on experimental manipulations of the beetle embryo. Undergraduates from the teaching college are linked to the research institution through both on-site visits and extensive online interactions.<br/> <br/>The hypothesis underlying this work is that the elongating Tribolium embryo represents a tissue that transitions between two mechanisms of convergent extension during early and late stages of embryo elongation. Based on preliminary data, a model of elongation in Tribolium is proposed in which anterior cells undergo ordered intercalation analogous to what is known in Drosophila embryo extension, while posterior cells move in a less orderly fashion relative to neighbors, directed by tissue-level boundaries in the elongating posterior. The work integrates experimental approaches with computational models to test these hypotheses. It combines live imaging of mutant embryos, that differentially affect the alternate models of elongation, with in silico modeling to provide mechanistic insights into Tribolium elongation. This research highlights Tribolium as a new model of elongation. It will develop a basic understanding of the unique genetic and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the discontinuous changes in tissue elongation in Tribolium's progressively elongating body axis. The proposed dynamic feedback between computational models and experiments will improve understanding of how upstream regulatory networks translate into discrete cell behaviors shaping morphogenesis. This work will also allow comparisons to the well-studied insect model, Drosophila, as well as vertebrates, which also elongate progressively. Such comparisons can identify variable versus conserved mechanisms of elongation, providing information about the evolution of fundamental processes that drive morphogenesis.

This project advances a new hypothesis that a small molecule, which plants use to make ethylene, functions itself as a novel plant hormone that impacts plant growth and development, and further investigates how the hormone functions at the molecular level throughout the evolutionary breadth of plants. The project has the potential to transform the plant hormone field by altering existing dogma, by requiring the reevaluation of several decades of ethylene literature and by impacting how future ethylene experiments are carried out. The knowledge gained from this project could contribute to future strategies for modifying crop plants for the benefit of society. The project broadens participation of underrepresented students by providing two to three student internships per year in the lab of the principal investigator. The internships involve partnerships with Howard University (an Historically Black College or University) and Eleanor Roosevelt High School (a local public school in which over 70% of the students are underrepresented minorities). The interns carry out aspects of the project while receiving valuable training in scientific methods, data analysis and communication. The project also provides training and career preparation for two postdoctoral scientists, two graduate students and two University of Maryland undergraduates. To further broaden participation, the principal investigator co-teaches summer research workshops for Howard University undergraduates. <br/><br/>The well-known ethylene precursor in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a non-proteinogenic amino acid. Compelling new data suggest that ACC itself may be an important signaling molecule that evolutionarily predated the ability of higher land plants to efficiently convert ACC to ethylene. In particular, ACC inhibits cellular differentiation and growth in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. This project tests the hypothesis that ACC is a novel plant hormone through analyses of ACC function, including an investigation of ACC signaling mechanisms. Insight into ACC function is provided by studies of ACC synthesis mutants and ACC responses in Marchantia, and in evolutionarily relevant species in the plant lineage (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Spirogyra pratensis, Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis thaliana), thus addressing the conservation of ACC function, while taking advantage of lower gene copy number in basal plants. In Arabidopsis, preliminary findings indicate that ACC can induce pollen tube growth concomitant with Ca2+ influx and can stimulate primary root growth. ACC activates Ca2+ currents in Arabidopsis root protoplasts, and notably, this activation is dependent on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ionotropic channels. The project tests the hypothesis that ACC is a GLR ligand using a combination of molecular genetics, patch-clamping, ion-specific vibrating probes and live imaging of Ca2+. Genetic evidence is sought based on phenotypic comparisons of glr mutants and ACC synthesis mutants in the range of plant species. The activation of GLRs by ACC, leading to the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in pollen tube growth and/or root growth, would be a breakthrough in understanding mechanisms of ACC signaling, as well as GLR signaling, and would represent a ligand-operated system of Ca2+ regulation for which no consensual system currently exists in plants. The striking ACC response uncovered in Marchantia provides for a genetic screen for ACC signaling mutants, followed by gene cloning based on T-DNA tagging or whole genome sequencing."

These studies may lead to novel strategies for breeding in agricultural settings, since the goal of such strategies is to produce plants and animals with new and beneficial traits.  The project will provide hands-on research training of future scientists, including a graduate student and number of high school students during the summers.  In addition, this project will serve as a launching point for presentations to local K-12 schools to promote understanding of genetics and evolution and to spark enthusiasm for scientific inquiry.    <br/><br/>Phenotypic plasticity, the capacity of a single genotype to produce different phenotypes in different environments, is pervasive in nature. In spite of its ubiquity the genetic and molecular bases of phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. In particular, the extent to which genes underlying individual traits are the same genes underlying phenotypic plasticity in those traits remains controversial, in part because there are precious few examples for which the underlying genetic architecture of both the trait and any associated plasticity in that trait have been clearly worked out. Recombination rate is an important example of a plastic phenotype. Using meiotic recombination rate as a prototypical plastic trait, this project will test the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity for a trait is mediated by the same genes underlying population-level variation in that trait. Using Drosophila melanogaster as the genetic model, experiments will include sequencing whole genomes, characterizing which genes are expressed and in what amounts, and association mapping to discover relationships of genotypes to phenotypes. The experiments will provide two sets of data, one identifying genetic loci associated with within-organism variation in recombination rate and the other identifying genetic loci associated with between-population variation in recombination rate.  If the same loci are identified in the two data sets, this result would provide important new insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity."

Traditionally, crystallographers determine whether an atom is present in a crystal structure by visual comparison with a contoured electron density map. HyPO takes a fundamentally different, quantitative approach by answering the question: What arrangement of atoms is most probable given a map? The combination of HyPO and powerful new neutron sources at collaborating Oak Ridge National Laboratory will make neutron crystallography more accessible to structural biologists. HyPO will be used to analyze ferredoxin, a key enzyme in photosynthesis whose hydrogen atoms have never been directly observed. HyPO analysis will be applied to the determination of neutron structures of ferredoxin to define how ferredoxin transfers electrons.

The project will explore the ways in which the hemoglobins (the oxygen carrying proteins of the blood) have changed to enable the uptake and release of oxygen under different atmospheric conditions (high and low altitude).

Experimental analyses of Hb function will be used to identify and characterize the molecular basis of evolved changes in Hb-O2 affinity in multiple bird species that have contrasting altitudinal range limits in the Andes. The comparisons will involve multiple phylogenetically replicated 'taxon pairs' (pairs of conspecific populations or closely related species that are native to high- or low-altitude). In cases where functionally distinct Hbs of high- and low-altitude taxa are distinguished by multiple amino acid substitutions, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and ancestral protein resurrection will be used to examine the functional effects of sequential mutational steps in all possible pathways that connect the ancestral (low-affinity) Hb and the derived (high-affinity) Hb. In addition to measuring oxygenation properties of each engineered Hb mutant, additional functional and structural properties that can potentially trade-off with Hb-O2 affinity will also be measured.

A major impact of this work is to rigorously train undergraduates in interdisciplinary research, combining computer modeling of elongation with hands-on experimental manipulations of the beetle embryo. Undergraduates from the teaching college are linked to the research institution through both on-site visits and extensive online interactions.<br/> <br/>The hypothesis underlying this work is that the elongating Tribolium embryo represents a tissue that transitions between two mechanisms of convergent extension during early and late stages of embryo elongation. Based on preliminary data, a model of elongation in Tribolium is proposed in which anterior cells undergo ordered intercalation analogous to what is known in Drosophila embryo extension, while posterior cells move in a less orderly fashion relative to neighbors, directed by tissue-level boundaries in the elongating posterior. The work integrates experimental approaches with computational models to test these hypotheses. It combines live imaging of mutant embryos, that differentially affect the alternate models of elongation, with in silico modeling to provide mechanistic insights into Tribolium elongation. This research highlights Tribolium as a new model of elongation. It will develop a basic understanding of the unique genetic and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the discontinuous changes in tissue elongation in Tribolium's progressively elongating body axis. The proposed dynamic feedback between computational models and experiments will improve understanding of how upstream regulatory networks translate into discrete cell behaviors shaping morphogenesis. This work will also allow comparisons to the well-studied insect model, Drosophila, as well as vertebrates, which also elongate progressively. Such comparisons can identify variable versus conserved mechanisms of elongation, providing information about the evolution of fundamental processes that drive morphogenesis. Additionally, the project will generate RNA Seq data, genetic tools, and models of embryo and tissue elongation useful to the community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The project focuses on a large protein complex called Mediator, which selectively turns on subsets of genes in both yeast and mammalian cells.  Two central questions will be addressed.  First, how does Mediator select and turn on its gene targets?  Second, how does Mediator action in yeast compare to its action in mammalian cells?  The comparative approach used in this project will have broad impact on fundamental understanding of gene activity in ""simple"" yeast versus ""complex"" mammalian cells.  Some of the results will be in the form of ""big data""--large data sets that describe molecular interactions across an entire genome--and these will be deposited in public archives where they can be freely accessed by scientists and the public.  In addition, the project will provide training for undergraduates, a postdoctoral fellow, and two female graduate students, one of whom is a member of an underrepresented minority.<br/><br/>The Mediator protein complex consists of over twenty interacting proteins and is found in all cells with nuclei (eukaryotes).  Mediator is known to play a critical gene activating role via association with the machinery responsible for RNA synthesis (transcription).  However, how Mediator locates its gene targets and exactly what it does when it finds them, are not completely understood.  This project will address these issues in three aims.  The first will test the idea that proteins belonging to the general transcription machinery help Mediator to find its targets.  The approach will be to compare Mediator association with its targets in normal yeast cells and in mutants in which components of the general transcription machinery are impaired, using a method called ChIP-seq that identifies where proteins associate with DNA across an entire genome.  The second aim will follow up on previous results that suggested that Mediator association with different targets is related to differential dynamics--how fast Mediator finds its targets and how often and rapidly it leaves again. This idea will be tested using variations of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP, the basis of ChIP-seq) that provide information on binding dynamics.  These first two aims will be done using the model system of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is easy to work with but is quite similar to mammalian cells in its molecular makeup.  In the third aim, the effect of impairing function of specific subunits of Mediator in mammalian cells on gene transcription will be tested by ""knocking down"" expression of those subunits and measuring the effect on genome-wide transcription by high throughput sequencing.  In yeast, this has been a productive strategy for understanding how Mediator structure relates to its function.  Comparing the results obtained in mammalian cells will reveal similarities and differences with yeast, and thereby reveal the value and limitations of knowledge gained using the yeast system."

Using highly sensitive techniques that can observe single molecules of DNA, this project will investigate how and why proteins slide.  The proteins studied in this project, known as restriction endonucleases, cleave DNA into two strands once they bind to their target site.  Many proteins that regulate and maintain the genome cleave DNA in their normal functioning.  New techniques of genetic engineering also require cleavage of DNA at a specific site.

These cells are representative of apical growing cells, a group that in addition to pollen tubes, includes fungal hyphae and developing neurons of the mammalian nervous system. Specifically these ion signals are needed to coordinate pollen tube growth and function required for fertilization. The results will not only contribute to predicting and manipulating cellular behavior leading to seed production, with potential agricultural impacts, but also to discovering new principles by which electric signals can define cell shape, guidance and communication extending beyond plant cells. This investigation will entail the development and integration of different STEM areas, including cell biology, genetics, computational methods and mathematical modeling. A data analysis pipeline and novel algorithms developed from the research will be made publicly available in R, an open-source statistical programming language, allowing analysis of complex oscillations and cell growth imaging. Educational and societal impacts include professional development of two postdoctoral researchers, undergraduate student training, and mentoring of local high school students. In addition, a number of outreach and educational activities are expected outcomes of the project, where the results and original approaches appealing to broader interests will be presented to a wide variety of audiences.<br/><br/>Fertilization in higher plants requires the male gametophyte (pollen tubes) to grow into the female tissues and locate available ovules, finally bursting to deliver the sperm cells. Pollen tubes are highly polarized cells and in some species have the fastest cellular growth rates known in nature. This vigorous growth is sustained by specific spatial and temporal choreographies, often involving stable oscillations, of intracellular ion concentrations focused at the tip, which in turn are generated by extracellular ion fluxes. The main hypothesis to be tested in this project poses the existence of an ion-based central pacemaker responsible for minute-range oscillations in pollen tubes, which (1) are generated by a negative feedback loop between channel activity and membrane potential, (2) coordinate macroscopic processes at the cellular level (e.g. cell polarity, apical growth, guidance), (3) are involved in cell-cell competition/cooperation between growing pollen tubes and (4) impact cell-cell communication with the female gametophyte. The first goal is to characterize oscillations in all parameters using custom-made electrophysiology tools and live imaging with genetically encoded probes (Ca2+, H+, Cl- and membrane potential). These will allow comparison between signatures of different species/ ecotypes and single and multiple mutants of gene families coding for channels and transporters in Arabidopsis. The features of the oscillations will be determined with data-analysis tools developed for the project, allowing the formulation of mathematical models. Specific predictions will then be derived from differential equation models in varying levels of detail, whereas experimental validation will be achieved by testing the predictions with mutations, pharmacology and in vivo fertilization protocols, among others."

This project investigates how the molecule, nitric oxide, controls these processes. Nitric oxide plays significant roles in almost every living organism.  Recent data show that nitric oxide helps plants to conserve water and produce seeds. GSNOR is a protein responsible for breaking down excess nitric oxide inside of cells; furthermore, plants that lack GSNOR are sensitive to heat stress, make fewer seeds, and suffer damage from excess nitric oxide. These observations suggest that GSNOR regulates nitric oxide levels and may also alter nitric oxide perception in plants. This research project will employ cutting-edge technologies to determine how GSNOR governs the reaction of nitric oxide with other proteins in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. This project has potential to uncover the means by which plants adapt to stresses such as heat and drought, and will inform efforts to improve the productivity of plants in a changing climate. In addition to involving one postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student, the project will also provide training opportunities for University of Massachusetts undergraduates and for high school students and teachers from Amherst Regional High School. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how nitric oxide (NO) and redox metabolism are integrated to control plant growth and development. Recent data implicate NO and protein cysteine oxidation (redox) in processes critical to the plant life cycle. Virtually all organisms utilize NO as a regulatory molecule, and cysteine oxidation is known to influence the biological function of many proteins in eukaryotes. The enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) plays a key role in NO homeostasis by catalyzing the NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the major reservoir of bioactive NO. In this research, investigators will employ molecular genetic, biochemical, metabolomic, and proteomic methods to assess the role of GSNOR in protein redox regulation and metabolic pathways in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Experiments will: (1) test the hypothesis that GSNOR activity is regulated post-translationally by redox modifications and/or by interaction with other proteins; (2) determine how alterations in protein nitrosylation may control plant phenotype; (3) measure how mutation of GSNOR alters GSH redox poise in vivo; and (4) measure flux of specific metabolic pathways whose altered regulation may be controlled by redox modifications.  This work will help elucidate the role of GSNOR in morphological and molecular phenotypes of plants associated with traits such as flower development, fertility and response to stress."

The project leverages expertise in the characterization of membrane systems, using model membrane systems and exploiting a suite of biophysical techniques (surface-pressure measurements, optical microscopy, fluorescence binding assays, atomic force microscopy, x-ray and neutron scattering) to provide new perspectives on two fundamental and reciprocally related questions:<br/>(1) How do membrane properties influence interactions with membrane targeting peptides and proteins?<br/>(2) How does the interaction of peptides and proteins alter the properties of a given membrane?<br/>The project specifically addresses these central questions in the context of immune response, focusing on two canonical examples of immune targeting of membranes during immune response: the disruption of pathogenic membranes by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids exposed on the extracellular leaflet of host cells as an effector of immune regulation. Both AMPs and peripheral PS membrane binding proteins have been hypothesized to employ sensitivity to differences in membrane properties to mediate their differential recognition properties. Thus the primary focus of this project is to first establish the sensitivities of a representative AMP (protegrin-1) and PS receptor family (T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-containting or TIM) to fundamental membrane properties. Additionally, the project also aims to reciprocally understand how the interactions of these peptides and proteins alter the underlying membrane properties."

Many cells can perform complex behaviors such as engulfing other cells, movement towards a source of food, and remembering past events. Even though most cellular components are believed to be discovered, it is still unclear how the molecules in a cell work together to perform relatively complex actions. This project seeks to solve the problem by applying concepts from theoretical computer science to understand how the cell switches from one activity to another. This will open up new possibilities for re-engineering cells by reprogramming their internal controls. This research program will create novel educational and outreach opportunities based on exposing students from a variety of scientific backgrounds, as well as members of the public with interests in electronics and computer hobbies, to the idea that cells can be viewed as computing machines; therefore awareness of quantitative cell biology among the next generation of engineering students will increase.  <br/><br/>While general understanding of the molecular biology of cells is constantly increasing, it has proven difficult to integrate this molecular scale information into a global view of how cells make decisions and perform complex behaviors like migration, phagocytosis, and division. The goal of this project is to connect the huge gap in complexity and detail from the molecular scale to the level of cell behavior by using concepts from computer science.  In computer science, the highly complex details of electronic circuitry can often be understood, analyzed, and designed by using abstract models in which a complex system is represented by a finite set of states, allowing behavior to be represented by transitions between states. Such models are called finite state automata and they are the most fundamental representation of a computing device. In this project cells are described as finite state automata, by using organelle size measurements to identify and define distinct states. It is hypothesized that an organelle-level state description will allow for the reduction of the dimensionality of the state space from millions of dimensions corresponding to individual molecules in the cell down to a much smaller number of dimensions based on organelle morphological measurements that are readily observable in living cells. Large numbers of cells will be imaged at high resolution, numerical descriptors of each organelle will be described, and a state space for cellular organization will be defined using statistically rigorous methods to define states and state transitions. The investigators will explore how chemical and mechanical inputs to the cell drive transitions within this state space, thus providing a way to view the cell as a type of finite-state automaton. Such a representation will also provide a framework for synthetic biology applications in which the regulatory pathways that determine state transitions could be re-wired to produce different behaviors, essentially turning a single cell into a programmable microdevice. The conceptual framework of the cell as a decision-making computational device will be harnessed to present outreach exhibits at Maker Faires, which are an ongoing series of events that bring together electronics, computer, and crafts hobbyists. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the program in Cellular Dynamics and Function in the division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences and the programs in Statistics and Mathematical Biology in the division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences."

This research examines the mechanistic and evolutionary interactions between two conserved domains in the context of the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily. An integrated experimental approach, including biochemical, structural, and bioinformatics techniques is used to (a) determine the identity of kinetic steps perturbed in allosteric inhibition, (b) predict and verify functional and structural diversity and (c) investigate the role of conserved residues in the allosteric mechanism. This type of approach overcomes several difficulties commonly encountered in the study of allosteric enzymes, moves away from the phenomenological description of different allosteric mechanisms and considers the impact of evolutionary pressures on the diversity of mechanisms within a conserved protein scaffold. Rapid-reaction kinetics and kinetic isotope effects will be used to investigate the changes to enzyme mechanisms caused by allosteric inhibitors.

Thus, in closing stomata plants restrict water loss as well as entry to potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Much in the same way that hormones regulate human cellular processes, plant hormones have been demonstrated to control plant response to changes in the environment, including the above noted response to environmental and pathogenic stressors. The long range goal of this project is to define how plant stress signals are regulated and transduced to elicit the plant immune response. To do this, the current work will use the plant stomata as a tractable marker to understand how chemical changes in a cell are perceived and ultimately transduced to regulate physical and mechanical changes in cellular movement, architecture, and shape. With this knowledge, the investigators will define the principle components that plants use to monitor their environments for potential threats, and moreover, to rapidly respond to these changes. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover mechanisms that plants use to survive, and through dissemination of the Broader Impacts, to communicate these data to society to educate general public in the area of food production and security. <br/><br/>Actin is well known for its roles in defining cell shape and powering movement of organelles and macromolecules in all eukaryotic organisms. Additionally, as a component of the immune system of both plants and animals, the actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to respond to a variety of pathogen-derived elicitors. However, the mechanism(s) underpinning the role of actin in plant immunity is lacking. This study will leverage recently developed methods and resources in the PIs' laboratories to define, using the stomatal guard cell as an experimental paradigm and a series of quantitative cell biology and genetic approaches, the contribution and role of actin as a key component of the plant immune network. Plant stomatal guard cells are an attractive, amenable, and biologically relevant cell type for further dissecting the role of actin dynamics in plant immunity. The work described herein will define the relationships that link basic physiological processes (e.g., hormone signaling, pathogen perception) to the host immune response. Anticipated impacts of this project are: 1) the elucidation of the processes that dynamically respond to and function as cellular switches between, pathogen, immunity, and hormone signaling; 2) the phospho-regulation and pathogen targeting of a key plant regulatory node that controls cytoskeletal organization and stomatal guard cell dynamics; and 3) a demonstration of a role for actin in critical stomatal-based signaling pathways."

Methane, the key component of natural gas, plays an important role in global carbon cycling and atmospheric processes.  Some methane-producing microbes (methanogens) have recently been shown to convert a group of compounds called quaternary amines (QAs) to methane. QAs are abundant compounds in many different environments, and methanogenesis in the human gut has been linked to the development of heart disease. Current knowledge of how methanogens can convert QAs to methane and how prevalent this process is in the environment is distinctly lacking. This gap in knowledge leads to potential inaccuracies in computer-generated models predicting the role of methanogenesis on Earth's atmosphere. This research project will address this gap in knowledge by 1) investigating the physiological mechanisms of methanogenesis via QAs and 2) identifying and quantifying the microorganisms responsible for this process in different environments. This research will also benefit students at the Miami University Hamilton, part of a community-based division of Miami University that serves students from first-generation, lower socioeconomic status, and under-represented minority groups. These students will contribute to the research project through classroom activities and undergraduate research.<br/><br/>Quaternary amines (QAs) are abundant natural compounds that have recently emerged as important substrates for microbes in anoxic environments, including methanogens. The breakdown of QAs has direct implications for diverse processes from global biogeochemical cycling to atherosclerosis in humans. Understanding of the mechanisms of anaerobic catabolism of QAs by methanogenic archaea, namely QA demethylation, is lacking. Early data suggest that pyrrolysine-lacking (non-pyl) methyltransferases from the COG5598 protein family are involved in QA-dependent methanogenesis along with cognate corrinoid binding proteins, but these pathways have not been elucidated. Determining the function of multiple enzymes from this family will facilitate better identification of the role of members of COG5598 in methane production. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that non-pyl COG5598 enzymes are responsible for QA demethylation and initiation of QA-dependent methanogenesis as part of a three-component corrinoid-dependent methyl transfer pathway, and that organisms encoding these pathways can be identified within the environment. In this work the investigators will: 1) identify pathways for QA-dependent methanogenesis from glycine betaine and tetramethylammonium using comparative proteomics and biochemistry techniques, and 2) determine the identities and relative abundance of predicted QA-utilizing methanogens in different environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The microbiome of the plant rhizosphere (the area around the root is known as the rhizosphere, and the group of microbes in an area is known as a microbiome), which can be compared to its human gut homolog, plays a critical role in plant health, ultimately affecting crop yield. Manipulation of the rhizosphere microbes is a proposed strategy for the achievement of sustainable agricultural practices. However, little is known regarding how most beneficial soil bacteria manage to find their target plants, and how they establish stable associations with the roots of plants once they find them. This gap in knowledge will be addressed by examining how bacteria deploy chemical detecting proteins on their surfaces and by studying how the signals from those sensing proteins enter and move around inside the cell. The work will provide detailed quantitative information about how beneficial soil bacteria precisely find their preferred zones on the root surface, and the results will  provide new tools for optimizing design of beneficial plant-bacteria associations. The project will have educational impact by providing research training for undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups in STEM. The project will also engage deaf and hard of hearing students in research and thus enhance participation of this critically underserved and untapped pool of talent. <br/><br/>This project will take advantage of the well-characterized chemotaxis response of the motile soil bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, as a model because it is a suitable representative of root inhabiting bacteria and it is successfully used to promote the growth of diverse crops in sustainable agricultural practices. The experimental design combines proteomics, genetics and computational modeling to address how motile bacteria set sensing preferences for roots. First, the mechanisms underlying the assembly of distinct chemotaxis receptor arrays which are typical of many beneficial root colonizing bacteria will be established (Objective 1). Next, the dynamic changes in the composition of chemotaxis receptor clusters will be related with changes in bacteria sensing preference and competitiveness in the rhizosphere (Objective 2). Because chemotaxis emerges from a sophisticated signaling pathway, it is difficult to predict population behavior from molecular mechanisms. The experimental data will be integrated with computational modeling to quantitatively describe how motile bacteria set chemotaxis sensing preference with change in their metabolism to precisely accumulate at a specific position in a gradient (Objective 3). Results obtained will uncover the engineering principles for manipulation of and/or the synthetic design of chemotaxis sensing preferences in beneficial soil bacteria. This knowledge is critical to develop future strategies for rhizosphere microbiome optimization for sustainable agriculture."

These shape changes are powered by the outer layer of the cell, which is called the ""cortex"".  The cortex contains a meshwork of fibrous proteins that can contract, protrude, and slide.  These movements provide the basis of cell shape changes.  The control of this fibrous network is the domain of a protein called Rho.  Rho is somehow activated in distinct patterns, each of which corresponds to a different cell shape change.  Thus, in order to understand and control processes such as cell division, cell migration and wound healing, it is essential to learn how to understand and control patterns of Rho activation.  In this collaborative project, investigators from the US and the UK use synthetic cell biology and mathematical modeling to test mechanisms underlying cortical pattern formation.  This project will provide research opportunities for interdisciplinary training at the interface between quantitative cell biology and mathematical modeling for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs.  The project also offers embedded research opportunities for high-school teachers as well as topic-specific K-12 and public outreach activities. <br/><br/>Previous studies by the PIs demonstrated that cells can support sustained waves of dynamically-coupled Rho activity and actin assembly, and mathematical modeling followed by experimental verification revealed that cortical wave propagation is based on Rho autoactivation and actin-mediated Rho inactivation.  This constitutes the basis of an ""excitable"" system, a family of well-established theoretical models with few previously-known cellular manifestations.  This project will deduce and experimentally validate a minimal molecular mechanism and basic design elements required for cortical excitability.  To achieve the goals of this project, a novel semi-synthetic platform for replicating complex cell behaviors using simple macromolecular parts will be employed, enabling manipulation of the molecular network at escalating complexity instead of by dissecting a complex physiological network.  The project will couple computational modeling of excitable dynamics to live-cell imaging in whole cells and in a new ex vivo model of cortical dynamics.  First, excitable dynamics will be reconstituted in resting, non-mitotic cells (oocytes of frogs and echinoderms) using natural regulators and their mutants, followed by their replacement with synthetic equivalents.  Second, a quantifiable ex vivo model will be developed (using frog oocyte or egg extracts and supported lipid bilayers) that permits precise control of system composition in a simplified context.  Third, to achieve on-demand control of cortical pattern formation, an optogenetic approach in animal oocytes will be used to explore the repertoire of both natural and synthetic cortical pattern formation.  Iterative experimentation and computational modeling will be employed throughout the project to 1) interpret biological data, 2) express candidate mechanisms in the form of mathematical models, 3) generate predictions, and 4) test those predictions experimentally."

The cells of most non-microbial life forms contain numerous mitochondria, organelles responsible for generating biological energy. Mitochondria contain their own genomes, which are far smaller than ""regular"" nuclear genomes and encode a unique set of genes related to energy metabolism. Proper mitochondrial functioning relies upon many gene products encoded by the nuclear genome. These two genomes must therefore evolve in concert; i.e., mitonuclear coevolution. This research will provide the first comprehensive assessment of nuclear and mitochondrial genomic change accompanying controlled, adaptive evolution under different reproductive systems. It will also result in discovery of novel mutations that suppress the effects of mitonuclear damage. The project will provide important data and resources to the scientific community, expand the PIs' educational and outreach activities, and provide research training and professional development for a postdoctoral fellow, a research technician, and graduate and undergraduate students. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes has long been used for forensic and phylogenetic applications, and defects in mitochondrial genomes are implicated in approximately 1,000 human genetic diseases, cancer and aging. The central importance of mitochondrial genetics and mitonuclear interaction to diverse areas of biological research suggest that this research will have far-reaching impacts.<br/><br/>This research will provide the first direct, non-retrospective tests of major hypotheses to explain mitonuclear genome coevolution. The project will apply experimental genomics with Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to study evolutionary process within the context of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the proper functioning of which relies on the maintenance of favorable mitonuclear epistatic interactions. The project will: 1) Determine the impact of sexual system on the tempo and patterns of mitonuclear adaptation. C. elegans strains containing deleterious mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded ETC mutations will undergo adaptation in replicate populations experiencing obligate selfing, facultative outcrossing, or obligate outcrossing, and 2) Determine the evolutionary dynamics, functional characteristics and sex-specific effects of individual mitonuclear mutations.

This project will address broadly relevant questions about cell cycle regulation. Namely, what is the function of the regulated degradation of crucial cell cycle proteins and how does this regulatory mechanism integrate with other levels of regulation to control the cell cycle?  By addressing these questions, this work has the potential to have a significant impact on our basic understanding of how the cell cycle is regulated.  This project will expose students to interdisciplinary research and allow undergraduate students in summer laboratory courses to be active participants in research.  <br/><br/>The timed synthesis and degradation of specific proteins is a ubiquitous mechanism of cell regulation. However, some proteins can be regulated by covalent modification or binding to an allosteric effector. If a protein's activity can be controlled without the energetic cost of degradation and resynthesis, what circumstances would favor regulation by proteolysis? To address this question, the investigators are studying CtrA, a transcriptional regulator that promotes cell division in Caulobacter, yet also blocks chromosome replication. To reconcile these opposing functions, CtrA activity is temporarily eliminated from the cell just prior to chromosome replication by both dephosphorylation and proteolysis. Caulobacter strains expressing a non-degradable version of CtrA can still initiate chromosome replication, indicating that CtrA activity can be significantly reduced by dephosphorylation alone. However, cells with non-degradable CtrA have subtle defects that may compromise their competitive fitness. During each division cycle, ~9000 CtrA molecules are degraded and resynthesized. To understand the selective advantages conferred by this apparently wasteful strategy, experimental and modeling approaches will be used to predict and test the consequences of regulating CtrA only by phosphorylation. In particular, this study will investigate whether the periodic degradation and resynthesis of a neutral passenger protein confers a competitive disadvantage in Caulobacter, as in other bacteria. Caulobacter strains expressing steady levels of a non-degradable CtrA protein will be used to identify phenotypes that differ from cells with oscillating CtrA levels. Competitive fitness assays and quantitative microscopy approaches will test explicitly the predictions of existing mathematical models, e.g., that cells with non-degradable CtrA experience a delay in chromosome replication and a longer cell division cycle. Existing deterministic and stochastic models of the Caulobacter cell cycle will be revised, taking into account recent published findings. Stochastic spatiotemporal modeling will benefit from single-cell data on times of division, chromosome replication, and protein localization."

In the cell, as much as a meter of DNA can be packaged into a dense aggregate that measures only a micrometer. This aggregate consists of a DNA protein complex that is referred to as chromatin, and its structure is central to gene regulation. Chromatin exhibits a truly hierarchical structure, in which modifications at the smallest length scales influence structure and dynamics over much longer distances. Importantly, deregulation, or ""misreading,"" of the underlying DNA has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer. Despite the inherent function of chromatin, its structure in the cell nucleus largely remains a mystery. This work will seek to resolve that structure, and potentially shed light on the origin and spread of various genetic disorders.

The proposed comprehensive model of chromatin will link one-dimensional primary structure and dynamics to three-dimensional secondary and tertiary structure and motion. It will rely on existing experimental data pertaining to multiple length scales, and it will couple top-down and bottom-up modeling design approaches. To do so, a strategy will be adopted in which advanced sampling techniques are used to extract free energy differences between different experimentally-proposed chromatin configurations. A guiding principle in the development of the model will be to gain the ability to span the range of length and time scales that are necessary to understand chromatin structure and dynamics. It is anticipated that, when completed, the proposed model will yield an unprecedented view of the genome and lead to hitherto unavailable insights into how genetic mechanisms are altered by external challenges.

Recent studies indicate that there are diverse molecular machines, RNA editosomes,that carry out this important process.  Not every RNA editing apparatus contains the same proteins.  In order to understand how the RNA editing mechanism works, the protein composition of RNA editosomes will be further characterized using genetic and biochemical methods.  By identifying all of the proteins needed for changing the RNA sequence, editing could be used in the future for deliberate modification of the RNA product and protein produced from a gene.  Such technology could benefit the biotechnology industry and society through application in many different fields.  The project will provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, including students participating in NSF REU program that involves a high proportion of underrepresented minorities and women from other colleges. In addition to scientific approaches, trainees will be mentored in both oral and written presentation of their experimental data.  Both the PI and coPI will continue to perform administrative service for the scientific community. The co-PI will continue her efforts to promote participation of women in STEM fields.  The PI will distribute a new multiplexed mass spectrometric protocol that can be used for individuals studying RNA editing in any organism.  <br/><br/>Recent progress has resulted in much increased knowledge of the composition of the plant RNA editing apparatus, but the precise protein composition of any particular editosome has not been identified.  In addition to a PPR protein, an editosome contains one or more members of three additional protein families, the RIP, ORRM, and OZ families and perhaps additional proteins.  Proposed experiments will lead to detailed characterization of particular types of RNA editosomes.  Functional epitope-tagged versions of OZ1 and a PPR protein will be used for affinity purification to determine the proteins comprising editosomes that contain either OZ1 or the PPR protein.  Genes encoding candidate proteins identified by mass spectrometry analysis will be subjected to genetic analysis to determine whether they are required for chloroplast RNA editing. The feasibility of transfer of an editing event to a heterologous system will be explored. The information that will be gained is essential for exploiting the phenomenon of RNA editing for genetic engineering at the post-transcriptional level.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Many molecular steps are involved in going from DNA to protein, with the biomolecule RNA playing a central role. Indeed, RNA is now thought to be the ancestral molecule at the dawn of life, as it can both store information (like DNA) and act as chemical catalyst (like protein enzymes). A remarkable, evolutionarily conserved family of Sm proteins plays key roles in RNA processing, in organisms ranging from humans to ancient single-celled organisms from the Archaeal branch of life. Sm-mediated pathways vary in scope from mRNA splicing in eukaryotes to RNA-regulated inter-cellular communication networks in bacteria. In each of these pathways at least one key step is mediated by a molecular assembly built upon Sm proteins. Given the ubiquity of the Sm family in contemporary RNA biology, ancient Sm proteins may have played a role in the pivotal transition from an ancestral RNA World to the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) world of modern life. This NSF project focuses on Sm systems from deep-branching archaeal and bacterial species. Leveraging both experiment (biochemistry, proteomics, crystallography) and computation (bioinformatics, simulations), the project will explore what ancient Sm-based RNP complexes look like (structure), their assembly pathways and dynamical behavior (function), and the interrelationships amongst the many Sm systems and their RNA partners (evolution). The work will help discover how the Sm family evolved into a pervasive scaffold for the construction of RNA-based molecular machines. The project's long-term objective - to decipher the biochemical roles of Sm proteins in the early evolution of RNA-associated molecular machines - also will illuminate, in molecular detail, the potential roles of the ancient Sm family in facilitating the transition from a primordial RNA world to our modern RNP world.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Beyond its scientific impact, this project will educate and train over a dozen under-graduate and graduate students in primary research. Because the project overlaps several disciplines, including biology (RNA, evolution), chemistry (crystallography, molecular simulations) and computer science (bioinformatics), students will learn the biological sciences in a truly integrated and interdisciplinary manner: The driving questions are biological, while the tools and approaches are physical/quantitative. This same multidisciplinary approach, uniting biology and computation, is the basis for the project's central educational plan, dubbed UVaCompBio. The basic model of the UVaCompBio project is that undergraduates from the biosciences and the quantitative sciences (physics, chemistry, CS, etc.) will be paired into teams that work together on active learning exercises and mini-projects over the course of an academic term, and in several areas of computational biology (physics- and informatics-based). This effort will (i) prepare students from the biosciences for quantitative biology, and (ii) give undergraduates from the quantitative sciences a working appreciation of the fascinating nature of complex biological systems. That two-fold goal will, in turn, achieve the ultimate goal of empowering students to be fearless learners who can work at the interfaces between seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines. Thus, over the course of the project period this educational initiative will train scores of undergraduate students and, with an emphasis on quantitative biology and a minority outreach component, will simultaneously and directly address these two major goals of modern science education."

Glutamate is one such molecule, which is not only an amino acid needed for the synthesis of proteins, but also the most important neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Glutamate is transported across the plasma membrane through active glutamate transporters, which play essential roles in controlling the levels of glutamate in the mammalian brain and other tissue. This project explores the fundamental principles by which these transporters work. Understanding these principles is important because it will contribute to our knowledge not only of the role of glutamate and nutrient movement between cellular compartments in the mammalian brain, as well as other organs of the body, but also glutamate homeostasis, which is important for cellular function in general. Furthermore, the developed methods for analyzing transport will be applicable to potential future studies of other neurotransmitter and/or nutrient transporters and membrane proteins. On the educational level, the project provides an invaluable opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved in cutting-edge biophysical research, providing training in basic physical, quantitative approaches to be applied to a significant biological problem. The investigator is continuing previous efforts of undergraduate involvement (including members of under-represented groups), which has led to many publications with undergraduate students as co-authors, as well as students successfully moving on to careers in research. The investigator is also very active in local and regional activities that promote the sciences at all levels, including demonstrations at schools, science fair involvement, and assuming leadership roles in the local American Chemical Society (ACS) section and the Science Olympiad. Such activities are necessary to ensure a vibrant local science community and to foster excitement of the upcoming generations of young scientists for science and research. <br/><br/>Active glutamate transport is a multi-step process that requires multiple ion/substrate binding steps, as well as conformational changes. Despite recent progress towards understanding the transport process through functional studies, as well as the identification of structural models of a bacterial homologue of mammalian glutamate transporters in several states, basic questions about the mechanism, specificity, and dynamics of interaction of the transporters with cations, in particular K+ and Li+, as well as the energetic contributions to energy barriers that control the transport rate and specific structural changes in the transport cycle remain unresolved. Answers to these questions are obtained by applying a combination of experimental and computational methods, allowing the investigation of the dynamics of glutamate transport in real time, with microsecond time resolution, and to test predictions from all-atom and simplified molecular models. This work has the potential to reveal new aspects of glutamate movement across the cellular membrane, in particular with respect to the cooperation of polar and non-polar forces, which are fine tuned to adjust the energy barriers associated with ion/substrate binding, as well as conformational changes. The novel insight may uncover more general concepts that are employed by membrane transport proteins, in order to provide a permeation pathway for polar molecules across the hydrophobic membrane."

Microtubules are critical for important cellular processes including cell division and development of the nervous system.  The cells within complex organisms have multiple variations of tubulin, called isotypes, that cooperate to assemble microtubules.  Why cells have multiple variations of these similar yet distinct tubulin isotypes remains largely unknown.  The goal of this CAREER project is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which microtubules can perform diverse tasks in different types of living cells.  To further broaden the impact of the project, the Principal Investigator and members of the research group will utilize multiple aspects of the project to develop science-based learning activities and curriculums for high school and college students.  These curriculums will be administered through programs designed to engage and educate underrepresented high school students in science-related activities and careers.  A new section of a learning team will be developed for college students at Iowa State University with undeclared majors that focuses on the advantages of studying model organisms in science.  This learning team will emphasize how the study of these organisms advances medicine, agriculture and general biological knowledge.  This effort will increase the proportion of students exposed to science-based career activities, strengthen science literacy, and build communication skills.  These activities will impact about 450 students over the course of the project.<br/><br/><br/>Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers comprised of tubulin protein, a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits.  The vast majority of eukaryotes express multiple variants, or isotypes, of alpha and beta tubulin.  A long-standing yet poorly understood question is the role of tubulin isotypes in microtubule functions.  This project utilizes a multifaceted approach to address the fundamental question of how tubulin isotypes dictate distinct microtubule functions.  The strategy draws on results with naturally occurring mutations and recent advances in the preparation of recombinant mammalian tubulin to test hypotheses for how specific isotypes function in axons and in oocyte meiosis.  These context-specific results will be complemented with genetic, proteomic and cell biological-based analyses of isotype function in the budding yeast model.  This comprehensive investigation will exploit the strengths of the yeast system to define mechanisms by which tubulin isotypes define specific microtubule functions.  Overall, the results of this project will generate paradigms for how tubulin isotypes mediate microtubule processes and have significant implications for understanding how they specify microtubule activities in diverse organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For bacteria, this decision consists of transitioning between a motile state, and a sessile, biofilm forming existence. Biofilms are defined as multicellular communities of bacteria that are encased in a protective extracellular matrix. Biofilms are the predominant form of bacterial growth in nature, and allow bacteria to survive predation, toxic chemicals, and harsh conditions. Thus, biofilms represent important ecological niches in every environment and influence industrial applications such as agriculture, bioenergy and water purification. Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) plays a fundamental role in the vast majority of bacteria to control the transition between motility and biofilm formation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which c-di-GMP regulates these behaviors are not well understood. This research project will study a novel mechanism by which c-di-GMP exerts its function. In Vibrio cholerae, c-di-GMP binds to a conserved RNA structure called a riboswitch. Riboswitches traditionally function by controlling the expression of the downstream gene on the same RNA segment. In V. cholerae, this riboswitch is designated as Vc2. However, preliminary experiments suggest that binding of c-di-GMP to Vc2 actually increases the stability of an upstream small RNA (sRNA), which then appears to impact bacterial behaviors. This project will focus on how (a) binding of c-di-GMP to Vc2 stabilizes the traget sRNAs; (b)the Vc2 target genes are regulated; and (c) the Vc2 RNAs impacts the biology of the bacterium. This research is likely to uncover a novel genetic regulatory mechanism that governs the transitioning between distinct phases of biofilm formation. Moreover, discoveries from this project will inspire new approaches to cultivate beneficial biofilms while inhibiting harmful ones.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will also serve as a platform to broadly engage members of the academic community and the general public in scientific education and discourse.

The investigator will also develop and teach a continuing education program titled ""Hot Topics in Sciences"" as part of the Evening College curriculum at MSU. This class will provide adults from the local community with the scientific principles behind a number of controversial science topics prevalent in the public consciousness.  The project team will also instruct local high-school science teachers about microbial biofilms in the MSU ""Frontiers in Science"" program.

Cells have developed complex biochemical events (signaling) that allow them to sense very subtle changes in the concentration of these chemical signals (gradients). The PI uses yeast cells as a model to study these signaling events, but they are likely broadly applicable to cells in more complex organisms as well. In previous studies, he identified a variety of biochemical events that are required for cells to interpret chemical gradients. In this project, he will investigate the contributions of two novel signaling events, using the classic tools of cell biology, molecular genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and imaging. In addition, the PI will develop a mathematical model that not only describes the known components of the signaling system, but also predicts novel components of the pathway. This approach is particularly exciting because it will allow the PI to identify signaling events that might not have been identified through experimentation alone. In short, this project will work at the interface of mathematics and biology to identify the critical regulators of cells' responses to the chemical signals that allow them to function appropriately. The PI is committed to science education at all levels and will use the project to train undergraduates and students in an AP biology class. Every other year, the PI will offer his newly developed graduate seminar course, ""Explaining Science"" designed to teach graduate students how to talk about their work with anyone, from a child to a congressperson. The project will give the PI's students and postdoc the chance to work with collaborators who are experts in diverse areas. Because the project is at the interface of math and biology, researchers in each discipline will gain a better understanding of how those in the other discipline think.<br/><br/>Chemotropism, directed cell growth in response to a chemical gradient, is integral to axon guidance, angiogenesis, pollen tube guidance, and fungal infection. Naturally occurring chemical gradients are very shallow and dynamic. Models of chemotactic phenomena invoke positive feedback loops that amplify small differences in receptor activation across the cell surface into a substantially steeper intracellular signaling gradient. It is presumed that the response of chemotropic cells to shallow chemical gradients is also amplified by interacting feedback loops, but a mechanistic understanding of such loops is lacking. The goal of this project is to understand how the chemotropic growth site is established upstream of directed secretion, and how the cell responds to changes in the gradient after initial orientation. Observations made during the current project suggest that two interconnected positive feedback loops underlie the establishment of receptor polarity upstream of directed secretion. A mathematical reaction/diffusion model of these mechanisms has been developed, and will be used in combination with experimental approaches to provide a better understanding of how gradient-aligned receptor polarity is established and maintained. The degree to which the model mimics the behavior of gradient-stimulated yeast cells will guide both experimentation and the evolution of the model itself. This project will lead to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of gradient sensing while simultaneously developing mathematical modeling as a tool for biologists. During this project period, the PI will continue to administer and train students in the NSF-Capstone Undergraduate Research Program, which he co-developed. He has also developed a graduate course, ""Explaining Science"", designed to teach graduate students how to explain their science to laypersons. He will meet annually with a high school AP biology class to discuss his research. The project will provide the PI's students and postdoc with interdisciplinary training, through interactions with collaborators who are experts in diverse areas. Specifically, the project is at the interface of math and biology and will provide students and postdoctoral researchers with training in this emerging area.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division and by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

Students trained on this project will participate in traditional field genetics, chromosome analysis using advanced microscopy, and molecular assays of the genes that control the process of meiosis that divides and segregates chromosomes.

This chromosome skews segregation in its favor through a mysterious mechanism that involves the formation of ""neocentromeres"" that move independently during meiosis. Segregation distortion mechanisms such as this are referred to as meiotic drive. Recent data indicate that a novel kinesin gene (Kin618) located on Ab10 controls neocentromeres and meiotic drive in maize. The goal of this work is to fully characterize Kin618 and to initiate a larger study to identify other factors involved.

The program will train junior scientists to develop and implement biophysical and biochemical based conceptual approaches to understand complex enzyme regulatory mechanisms, to become leaders in this multidisciplinary field. As a result of this project, new experimental measurements will be made available to be incorporated into the biological physics curriculum to allow direct ""hands-on"" analyses by junior scientists in training. The PI will continue to expand upon her outreach initiatives in an effort to encourage and train scientists from a diverse range of academic and social backgrounds.<br/><br/>Phage-host systems are under intense evolutionary pressure, consequently they have developed remarkably ingenious mechanisms of attack and defense. This project investigates one such remarkable system: that found in Streptomyces griseus. Based on its biochemical activities, SgrAI, a nuclease from S. griseus, is postulated to be activated by binding to invading phage DNA, simultaneously expanding its DNA sequence cleavage specificity and forming polymers that may act to protect the host DNA from its resulting off-target cleavage activity. Enzyme mechanisms involving polymer or filament formation are exceedingly rare, although recent screens suggest this may be more common than previously thought. Being a potentially new paradigm for enzyme regulation, several fundamental questions arise that will be investigated in this research project, including the structure, kinetics, and biological role of the polymer. Biochemical data suggests that the polymer formed from activated SgrAI is a run-on oligomer, which has now been confirmed by the 8.6  cryo-electron microscopy structure. Although this structure shows how the SgrAI dimers bound to activating DNA associate in a repeating helical arrangement, fundamental questions such as how DNA cleavage is activated, how DNA sequence specificity is altered, and whether or not domain swapping (found in a crystal structure of two DNA bound SgrAI dimers) is present require higher resolution and therefore remain to be answered. Also important to understanding the function of the run-on oligomer is determining how formation of such an assembly, where the bound DNA appears critical for oligomer stability, accelerates rather than impedes multiple DNA cleavages. Finally, the biological role for run-on oligomer formation has been hypothesized to function in protecting the host DNA from dangerous off-target cleavages made possible via activation of SgrAI, by sequestering SgrAI on the invading phage DNA. This project will investigate the structure of the run-on oligomer using biochemical and x-ray crystallographic methods, measure kinetic steps involving polymer formation and dissociation in the reaction pathway using pre-steady state fluorescence methods, and test the postulated biological role of the polymer using in vitro and in vivo assays including phage infection challenges."

A well-known example is the DNA code, which has only four unique nucleotides, but can be combined to create all of the living complexity we see on planet earth. Another example is the potentially endless combinations of proteins - small molecules that often assemble into molecular machines - that are used to regulate biological processes. Of particular interest to many scientists is how special groups of proteins called transcription factors come together to regulate gene expression. This is important because changes in gene expression, as controlled by these transcription factors, underlie most responses to environmental change. Numerous techniques, both in the test-tube and in living organisms, have been developed to examine how transcription factors regulate gene expression, but there remains a paucity of experimental systems that allow scientists to examine how groups of interacting transcription factors assemble and function in living cells. Therefore, this project will develop a cutting-edge system to allow scientists to simultaneously express three (or more) proteins and address this initial question - how do these relatively simple transcription factors work together to result in complex changes of gene expression? In addition to providing a valuable tool for the scientific community, the project will have education and training impact for undergraduates who will be exposed to research via a teaching module emphasizing planning, execution, and data analysis.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will carry out the research, which will provide them with the training opportunity and intellectual challenge of developing a novel system for biological research.  The project will also involve a local high school student as part of the research team in each summer.<br/><br/>How multi-subunit transcription factors achieve genomic-level substrate affinity and regulate gene expression is largely unknown. Systems for studying transcription factor function often rely on in vitro assays that can have the advantage of excellent resolution, but are highly specialized and tend to require protein purification. Alternatively, a variety of in vivo assays can provide either local or global binding patterns, but typically suffer from low resolution. Here a novel in vivo yeast system - which incorporates highly-specific hormone induction, a novel effector cassette, and a luciferase reporter system - will be developed to examine the interactions between multi-subunit transcription factors and their putative cis regulatory elements. Once developed, the system will permit rapid and accurate evaluation of how changes in any of the transcription factor subunits, or their cognate cis regulatory elements, alter binding affinity and gene expression outputs. For proof-of-concept studies, interactions between plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) and CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TIMING OF CAB (CCT) transcription factors will be examined. Once proven, the modular nature of this yeast system will make it readily adaptable for use by other labs."

Light is both an essential resource and a source of stress, in that it damages the photosynthetic apparatus and other cellular structures through a process called photo-oxidative processes. As such, plants have evolved mechanisms that optimize the use of light, minimize light-induced damage, and promote repair of the photosynthetic apparatus should it occur. In this study the light-regulated synthesis of a gene product essential to this process, D1, will be examined. The rate of D1 synthesis changes rapidly in response to shifting light intensity and therefore the goal of this project is to elucidate the signaling pathways and mechanisms that mediate D1?s response.  This problem will be addressed through genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches in maize and Arabidopsis.  These activities will provide research training for two undergraduate students, one PhD student, and a high school teacher. In addition, novel methods will be explored that have the potential to propel research on other topics.  <br/><br/><br/>The hypotheses to be tested arise from recent ribosome profiling data that provide the first genome-wide views of the impact of light on translation in chloroplasts. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches in maize and Arabidopsis will be employed, including a state-of-the-art method for identifying proteins bound to specific RNAs-of-interest in vivo, and a novel strategy involving designer RNA binding proteins. One set of experiments will test the hypothesis that the rapid light-induced change in ribosome occupancy on psbA mRNA (which encodes D1) is mediated by post-translational modification of proteins that bind the psbA 5' untranslated region. A second set of experiments will test the hypothesis that the global change in translation elongation rate is mediated by light-dependent post-translational modifications of proteins that stall ribosomes or catalyze translation elongation. A third set of experiments will address whether light induces these responses via the same signal transduction pathways that trigger other adaptations in response to photosynthetic activity. Finally, experiments will test the hypothesis that gene-specific translational regulators in chloroplasts, including those that regulate translation in response to light, generally act by modulating RNA structure proximal to ribosome binding sites.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

Maize is a powerful model system for functional genomics in the grain crops, because its reference genome has recently been sequenced and functional tools are increasing. However, new methods of investigating gene function within cells and tissues are needed to understand protein functions at the cellular and sub-cellular level, which will ultimately provide guiding information for crop improvement.  This project aims to generate tools in maize that can be used to drive expression of any gene in a number of specific chosen tissue or cell types. The use of these tools will permit the visualization of reporter genes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, and will also enable functional gene over-expression or gene knockout studies. In addition, this project will make use of newly improved fluorescent protein color tags to label sub-cellular or developmental compartments, and will develop live imaging techniques for growing maize plants to demonstrate the utility of all of the reporter lines for functional studies.  The project will therefore transform functional genetic experiments in maize, by providing a means to understand gene function in specific cells and tissues during development. The project will deliver to the research community a permanent stock of stably transformed seeds for 50 tissue specific activator/reporter lines, 20 fluorescent-tagged protein lines, as well as fully characterized in vivo imaging methods.  It will also develop a pipeline for handling large image datasets that will be applicable to other projects. All resources, including images, seeds and gene constructs, will be publicly available via the project website http://maize.jcvi.org/cellgenomics. For long-term availability, images will be migrated to the community database, MaizeGDB, and seeds will be deposited with the Maize Genetics Stock Center. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts.

A critical factor to form each unique cell type is the regulation of distinct sets of genes during development. However, how cells coordinate the expression of sets of genes that control cell fate before and after fertilization is still mysterious. In this project, the investigator's studies use C. elegans, a model worm organism, to focus on key regulators of gene expression called histone H2A variants. The goal of this project is to define the specialized mechanisms used by a specific H2A variant to regulate distinct sets of genes required for sperm and embryo development. This work will be conducted at San Francisco State University, an urban minority-serving public institution with a mostly undergraduate student population. The investigators will engage the diverse students directly in the research to apply molecular, computational, and cytological methods to determine H2A variant gene regulation mechanisms. Students will publish their research in traditional journals or ""micropublication: biology"", a new platform to provide rapid peer-reviewed, high-quality findings directly to the public. These studies will advance the career development of diverse students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The investigators will determine roles of the C. elegans sperm-specific histone H2A variant HTAS-1 in three aims. In Aim 1, students will use RNA-seq to define how HTAS-1 regulates transcription of target sites during sperm formation. In Aim 2, students will mine data from public databases and collaborators to define overlap of HTAS-1 with histone modifications, transcription factors, tissue-specific transcripts, and cis elements that specify sperm fate or regulate gene expression. Differences in transcriptomic profiles in the absence of HTAS-1 will support HTAS-1 function in mechanisms of transcriptional initiation, elongation, and co-transcriptional processing linked to H2A variants in other systems. In Aim 3, they will follow the dynamics of HTAS-1-dependent expression of individual genes before and after fertilization to determine epigenetic roles of HTAS-1. Together, these approaches will define co-regulators, cis regulatory elements, and mechanisms that H2A variants use to regulate gene expression during sperm differentiation and embryo development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All living organisms contain DNA, the genetic material that serves as the blueprint for life. DNA from diverse organisms, such as bacteria and humans, has chemical modifications that affect how the encoded information is read. One such modification is methyladenosine.  Methyladenosine is commonly found in bacterial DNA and can change how cells process information by altering the genes that are switched on, which in turn can help the cell respond to changes in nutrient availability. This research examines a previously unstudied protein that forms methyladenosine in bacteria. When this protein is inactive and adenosine methylation is lost, cells undergo substantial changes in gene activity that affect how the cells develop and behave. This research benefits society by determining how methyladenosine influences bacterial development, including the formation of multicellular bacterial structures and distinct cell types that can affect antibiotic resistance. In addition to the research benefits, further societal impacts of this project include teaching the expanding field of computational biology to students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. The project's outreach initiative provides high school students in rural Northern Michigan with the opportunity to learn introductory bioinformatics using an online educational portal developed as part of this research. Further, this project provides training opportunities for the next generation of scientists at both the undergraduate and graduate levels with specialized training in cutting edge sequencing approaches and methods of data analysis. <br/><br/>The genomes of organisms from all three domains of life are known to harbor chemical modifications in the form of DNA methylation. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a type of modification detected in prokaryotic and some eukaryotic genomes. Although m6A methyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for genomic m6A, are found in many diverse bacterial species the function of m6A remains largely unstudied. The goal of this project is to understand the effects of genomic m6A modifications in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Initial experiments have shown that elimination of m6A from the B. subtilis genome results in the expression of genes involved in bacterial developmental processes. Moving forward, this research project will investigate the mechanism by which m6A affects the expression of genes involved in bacterial cell developmental transitions. Global genomics approaches will be used to determine the differences in bacterial chromosome structure, genome-wide protein landscapes, and gene expression upon loss of m6A. Further, targeted biochemical approaches will be used to determine if m6A is necessary and sufficient for differential gene expression and to identify the factors that respond to m6A in DNA regulatory regions. Once complete, this project will provide a mechanistic understanding for how m6A-dependent changes in gene expression interface with bacterial developmental platforms."

Genomes are broadly comprised of genes which encode proteins, and the non-gene, noncoding regions. An important function of these noncoding DNA sequences is to bind proteins, which in turn will control when, where, and to what level the genes are activated, or expressed. How these DNA:protein interactions evolve and direct changes in gene expression is almost entirely unknown. The research here will contribute to an understanding of how proteins can evolve changes in the strength, or affinity, of DNA binding, and how this leads to the evolution of gene expression. The project will also provide training opportunities to a postdoctoral fellow, including opportunities for training in mentoring more junior scientists. Undergraduates will be meaningfully engaged in hands-on, self-directed research training in genomics, genetics, bioinformatics and evolution. Such cross-disciplinary training is critical for preparing the next generation of biologists. The lab group will also reach out to local area high school students by providing a module in animal diversity, evolution, and the use of genome and bioinformatics tools, thereby extending the existing curriculum and engaging students early in their biology education. The sequencing data generated from this research will be housed in an online, openly accessible database. <br/>  <br/>This project will provide the first comparative, broad-scale, in vivo experimental validation that low- and high-affinity transcription factor binding sites confer functional differences in gene expression and will contribute to an understanding of how this has evolved. Recent technologies have been developed that allow assessment of the range of DNA binding preferences and associated affinities for transcription factors. Use of these technologies demonstrated that three orthologous transcription factors--mouse Eomesodermin, sea urchin Tbrain and sea star Tbrain--have maintained almost identical high-affinity binding motif preferences but have evolved changed preferences for a low-affinity motif. The project here directly extends this work to examine the roles that transcription factor DNA binding affinity may have in regulating gene expression, and the consequences that this has for phenotype. Using echinoderm embryos as a model, the project uses whole-genome ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, together with a new, medium-throughput ""nanotag"" method, to assess regulatory function in vivo. The aim is to determine the association between motif use and response to changing levels of Tbrain and its putative cofactor Smad2/3.  This will test whether high-affinity or low-affinity motifs are most responsive to changing levels of Tbr protein, if association depends on the number of sites, and how this response will differ between the two species. The work is expected to provide a new conceptual framework for how gene expression can evolve through use of high- and low-affinity binding sites."

Epigenetic changes are alterations in the DNA or protein components of chromatin that affect gene expression. Epigenetic modifications that are of transient nature are widespread in the plant kingdom, but are rarely isolated or identified because the associated phenotypes are not easy to see and the modifications are not stable from generation to generation. Using the pericarp color1 (p1) gene and its red pigmentation as a marker in maize, allelic variation at the p1 locus has been shown to be a function of gene structure and organization, which is further regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.  To understand the basis of allelic diversity modulated through epigenetic regulation of gene expression, molecular and genetic characterization of a dominant mutation called Ufo1 (Unstable factor for orange1) has been performed. Plants with a particular p1 allele, called P1-wr, produce ears with colorless kernel pericarps and red cob glumes, and this silent pericarp phenotype is stable; however, in the presence of Ufo1 the P1-wr allele confers variably enhanced pigmentation phenotypes in several tissues.  Expression studies demonstrated that the gain of pigmentation is associated with increased steady state levels of P1 transcript. Enhanced P1 expression in P1-wr;Ufo1 plants was shown to correlate with a decrease in DNA methylation at the promoter and coding sequence of the P1-wr allele.  In the current project, map based cloning of ufo1 gene will be carried out. New alleles of ufo1 will be generated using transposon mutagenesis. Evidence for Ufo1-mediated effects on epigenetic regulation will be analyzed using high throughput sequencing methods for global profiling of chromatin, transcript (mRNA and small RNA), and DNA methylation of Ufo1 mutant and wild type plants. A database will be developed to visualize and analyze data generated from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and bisulfite sequencing. The results will establish the role of the Ufo1 mutation (and wild type ufo1 gene) in effecting global changes in transposons, DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA profiles. Because Ufo1 does not appear to act in the same way as other known epigenetic regulators in maize, this project will expand understanding of how overlapping epigenetic pathways regulate gene expression in this important crop plant.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide training opportunities in plant epigenetics and study of allelic variation of plant genes.

Cellular volume, cell cycle state, and mRNA abundance will be measured simultaneously in single cells for a panel of endogenous genes using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH).  For many genes mRNA concentration remains relatively constant regardless of cell cycle and six-fold variations in cellular volume, demonstrating the existence of homeostatic mechanisms in gene expression. It will be determined whether this compensation arises from the control of transcription or of mRNA degradation by using perturbations to transcriptional activity.

This process, called superinfection exclusion (SIE), is used by many viruses, including important pathogens of humans, animals, and plants; it plays an important role in the pathogenesis and evolution of viral populations and has clear implications for treating viral infections. For instance, in plants, purposeful inoculation with a harmless virus strain can be used to protect plants from infection by related pathogenic viruses. In spite of its significance, the phenomenon of SIE is not well understood. Thus, elucidation of the SIE mechanism(s) should have broad scientific impact by providing a necessary foundation for development of new strategies to control viral diseases of humans and economically important agricultural crops. The research will also have strong educational impact by offering training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students and by developing tools that can be used for promoting STEM learning by younger students. <br/><br/>This research project aims to elucidate the mechanism of SIE of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a member of the family Closteroviridae, which includes the largest and most complex positive-strand RNA viruses of higher plants. CTV represents a valuable model system for studying SIE, due to the existence of numerous well-characterized isolates with distinctive genetic characteristics. Furthermore, CTV provides a possibility for studying this phenomenon at the whole organism level. The project builds on observations suggesting that SIE by CTV operates by a unique mechanism, which involves multiple virus-encoded factors. Advanced genetic tools will be combined with innovative techniques and ultrastructural approaches for studying protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. Materials and data produced by the project will be openly accessible for research and educational uses. For example, the fluorescently-tagged viruses used as part of the research enable visualization of virus movement in infected trees and thus serve as an excellent learning tool for engaging young students. Taken together, the results of the research are expected to produce new insights into the mechanism of SIE by CTV, as well as to advance understanding of virus-host interactions."

One of the grand challenges in biology is the development of a molecular level understanding of how genetically-encoded instructions are converted into the behaviors observed in living systems. However, tractable model systems for quantitatively investigating the complex control of biological processes are generally lacking but would advance the understanding of control in biology and translate, as other model systems have, into tools for engineering complex control architectures in designed biological systems. The focus of this project is on improving the quantitative molecular level understanding of a simple biological system, bacteriophage M13. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been central to the development of molecular biology.  As model systems for understanding molecular phenomena, phage systems remain at the forefront of research in nanomaterials and nanomedicine and act as important component-generating technologies for drug and material discovery through phage display.  The PI will develop a detailed model of the molecular interactions that govern the behavior of phage systems, which will provide quantitative insight to enable applications in synthetic biology, nanotechnology, bio-manufacturing and medicine.  The PI will use interactive platforms to engage K-12 students in computational systems biology projects, integrate undergraduates in research, and train students thus contributing to the preparation of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Building on previous work involving a simulation of M13 growth that integrates 50 years of experimental observations, the goals of this project are to evaluate the nested feedback control loops in the M13 life cycle and fill in gaps in the quantitative understanding of M13 biology. The first objective of the current project involves quantification of the poorly-understood M13 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that govern phage DNA replication and the system level response to modifications of the DNA replication program. The second objective involves the identification and quantification of the protein-RNA interactions that regulate the timing and extent of phage protein production.  Within this aim the system level effects of modifying the protein-RNA control mechanisms will be investigated. The final objective of the project is to integrate the results of the experiments into the simulation model.  This aim will focus on augmenting the model with new quantitative data from Aims 1 and 2, and evaluating the present state of understanding by comparing the results of the system level experiments to predictions. Repeated cycles of theoretical refinement and experimental testing are required to build an engineering design cycle for M13 phage. This proposal will result in a greatly improved quantitative understanding of M13 biology and an infrastructure for the design and production of highly modified particles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon exposure to chemical or mechanical stresses, proteins can misfold, resulting in large changes in three-dimensional structure and loss of protein function. To survive, cells have developed quality control systems that guide misfolded proteins towards pathways that lead to them either being repaired or discarded. This project will determine the biological principles that allow cells to respond to protein misfolding by directing misfolded proteins for destruction. Another goal of this project is to develop techniques that will enable further investigations into how cellular responses to protein misfolding can be controlled. The integrated education objective of this CAREER project is to increase retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM through direct outreach at the high school and undergraduate levels via hands-on research experience and through different outreach programs. The project will integrate research directly into graduate and undergraduate courses with an emphasis on hands-on interpretation of real data and attention to development of visual, verbal and written communication skills. <br/><br/>The requirement for cells to respond to mechanical, thermal or chemical stresses is ubiquitous in biology. The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP and the 70 kilodalton heat shock protein, Hsp70, play pivotal roles in the response to cellular stress through the convergence of refolding and degradative pathways. The research will forge connections between dynamics on the picosecond to millisecond timescales and the biological function of chaperoned ubiquitination complexes. The incorporation of gain-of-function mutants developed using insights from high-resolution X-ray crystallographic information will identify the effects of enhancing the CHIP/Hsp70 interaction. The project will redefine how the protein quality control field views the role of interactions between Hsp70 and CHIP in regulating how cells respond to protein misfolding by employing either refolding or degradative approaches. The combination of NMR, SAXS, and EPR with biolayer interferometry will generate advances in the use of hybrid methods for structural biology. A novel real-time ubiquitination assay will demonstrate the utility of biolayer interferometry for rapid and sensitive monitoring of a processive post-translational modification."

Results from this research will lead to technological improvements of biological platforms that already serve for production of biofuels and bioplastics, and will also expand efforts into developing biomining and biostimulants platforms, transforming both the energy and agricultural industries.

Further, inclusion of high school students to develop experiments of the project will provide a unique opportunity to develop real research that can be included in peer reviewed manuscripts.  <br/><br/>Rare earth metals are highly insoluble and yet bacteria are able to acquire and use these metals for growth. Research herein will define how bacteria are able to 1) scavenge these metals, and once inside the cell, 2) what enzymes and pathways rely on rare earth elements for functionality. Preliminary results suggest that rare earths recovery involves a parallel system to the TonB-dependent Fe scavenging pathway, and that the use of rare earths as cofactors expands beyond the few alcohol dehydrogenases described until now. Finally, rare earth metabolism affects bacterial interactions with its host resulting in biostimulation of plant growth. By using a combination of system-level approaches (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) along with phenotypic, genetic and biochemical approaches, the metabolic network supporting growth when rare earths are present will be unraveled."

Understanding the maintenance of bacterial cell shape have primarily focused on rod-shaped cells. Yet we know of myriad cell shapes present in nature that are maintained by strong selective pressures. Determining the roles and underlying mechanisms of these unusual morphologies can provide great insight into a wide range of bacterial physiological properties. In particular, some bacteria synthesize unique ""appendage"" structures, or localized cellular extensions. For example, the stalked bacterium Verrucomicrobium spinosum produces a large number of spikes across its entire surface and Mycoplasma pneumoniae adherence requires a membrane-bound cell extension termed the tip-structure. In order to study the regulation and synthesis of such bacterial appendages, this project focuses on the model stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Preliminary data suggest that the stalk cell wall is chemically distinct from that of the cell body; this finding is striking because it would be the first demonstration of a bacterium with differentially regulated domains containing unique chemical structures. A detailed understanding of the chemical and mechanical properties of the stalk cell wall and characterization of proteins involved in stalk elongation will provide important insight into the fundamental question of the evolution and function of bacterial shape and compartmentalization. In addition to the research goals of this project, there are several educational objectives targeting high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. New courses will be developed for students at each level to train the next generation of scientists in quantitative methods in biology including bioinformatics, quantitative image analysis, and biophysics. In particular, the high school component will involve students at the LEAP Academy in Camden, whose enrollment is 90% underrepresented minorities. Each of these programs is designed to interface with and contribute to the two research projects.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to determine the mechanisms underlying localized bacterial envelope synthesis and appendage formation using the polar-stalk of Caulobacter crescentus as a model system. The central hypothesis is that Caulobacter produces a polar stalk whose peptidoglycan (PG) has distinct chemical and mechanical properties from the cell body PG. Previous studies of stalk synthesis have either focused on known PG regulating enzymes or on the localization of stalk associated proteins. In contrast, this approach is innovative because the starting point is the observation that the stalk envelope is compositionally different than that of the cell body. From this perspective, the central<br/>hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: 1) Define the composition and mechanical properties of stalk peptidoglycan; 2) Targeted analysis of the stalk biosynthesis regulatory proteins; and 3) Identify novel stalk-elongation genes by genotyping stalk-phenotype mutants. Under the first aim, experimental approaches will be used to determine the chemical makeup and quantify the elastic modulus of stalk PG. The link between PG composition and mechanical properties will be further explored via computational modeling. Under the second aim, the role of MreB will be investigated using a novel MreB fluorescent fusion construct that is defective for stalk biogenesis while retaining wild type function for cell growth. Studies of the putative transpeptidase CC2105 will focus on a C-terminal domain which is uniquely conserved among the stalked bacteria of the Caulobacteraceae family. In the third aim, high school students at the LEAP Academy will use a combination of traditional genetics methods and next generation sequencing to characterize a set of recently isolated stalk-elongation mutants. The proposed research is anticipated to contribute in-depth knowledge of how stalk-specific envelope synthesis results in compartmentalized regulation of cell shape. This vertical advance in the field of bacterial cell biology suggests that the dynamic regulation of localized morphology may be a general strategy employed by bacteria to maintain physiological control over cell shape or create subcellular compartments/appendages."

For humans to walk, hear, or touch, proteins must generate and respond to forces after folding into their correct three-dimensional structure. Yet, traditional biochemical techniques do not measure a protein's response to force, hindering progress in the emerging field of mechanobiology. Inside a cell, force can induce subtle change in a protein's structure, fully unfold a protein, or disrupt the interaction between two proteins. These effects all have biological consequence. To exert a force on individual proteins and measure these tiny signals, this project will use novel atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers, which are micron-scale, diving-board like force sensors. This project will help elucidate the response of proteins to force, a critical but understudied signaling mechanism in biology. More generally, studying the process of protein folding with these novel cantilevers will provide insight into how proteins fold, an ongoing challenge despite five decades of effort. By using the tools of physics and nanoscience to solve exciting problems in biology, this project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training for high school and colleges students just starting their research career. As statistics are vital to interpreting experiments but are poorly understood by many young researchers, this project will also generate novel training tools focused on statistics and data analysis using biological examples.

The key technical hurdle is that traditional AFM studies lack the spatial precision to resolve subtle changes in protein structure and lack the temporal precision to characterize the conformational dynamics of a traditional globular protein during the brief time the protein moves along its transition path. This project will overcome these obstacles by applying a state-of-the-art combination of force precision, stability, and time resolution enabled by focused-ion beam modification of AFM cantilevers. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics."

This so-called quality control mechanism serves as a fail-safe to make sure that proteins are produced accurately and in the right quantities.  Then, as the cellular environment becomes more favorable, the block on protein synthesis needs to be removed.  Understanding how cells resume normal function is the goal of this project.  Successful completion of this research will enable scientists to accurately predict the quantity of proteins that cells produce under different conditions.

At times, ribosomes can encounter roadblocks and stall their motion for long periods.  To rescue these stalled ribosomes, cells rely on several enzymes that are collectively referred to as quality control factors.  A major unresolved question in the field of translation research is how quality control factors recognize and rescue stalled ribosomes, without any adverse effect on normally translating ribosomes.  Recent results have provided an important clue:  efficient quality control occurs only on mRNAs with high rates of translation initiation. Using data from high resolution measurements of protein and mRNA levels in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, computational models have been formulated to test the hypothesis that collisions between multiple ribosomes serve as the trigger for quality control.  Computational models will provide predictive information to guide experiments aimed at exploring this idea. Genetic and biochemical experiments will be used to dissect the enzymes that mediate the effect of ribosome collisions on quality control and to identify mRNAs in the cell whose translation is affected by ribosome collisions.  The results will provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms and dynamics of this important quality control process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a simple model system to gain broadly applicable insights into the molecular events responsible for maintaining strict temporal control over gene expression. Meiosis, a differentiation process that produces haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells through division without DNA synthesis, and mitosis, through which cells proliferate through division after DNA synthesis, are conserved pathways throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. In fission yeast, the switch from cellular proliferation to differentiation in response to adverse environmental conditions is mediated by sequential waves of altered transcript accumulation that correlate with early events (DNA replication and recombination), middle events (cell division) and late events (spore formation). The overarching goal of this project is to dissect the molecular mechanisms through which members of the forkhead family of transcription factors function antagonistically to prevent inappropriate expression of meiotic genes in mitotically growing cells and collaboratively to promote productive RNA synthesis and processing during meiosis.  Although some forkhead family members act as conventional promoter-restricted transcription factors that regulate initiation, recent work in the principal investigator's laboratory has revealed association of these factors along the entire gene body and even downstream from the coding region in meiotic cells.  Consistent with this unusual distribution, complementary data indicate that forkhead factors regulate the addition of a polyadenosine tail to newly synthesized mRNAs, which is mechanistically linked to transcription termination. The first two specific aims of this project will test the working hypotheses that the decision between polyadenylation and read-through transcription is enforced by differential recruitment of RNA processing factors at the promoter and/or competition between elongation and termination as the transcription complex traverses the polyadenylation signals.  The third aim will utilize deep sequencing of RNA from forkhead-regulated meiotic genes, followed by bioinformatic analysis to reveal shared sequence motifs and other features that may be required for their coordinate regulation.  The discovery that forkhead factors function at the interface between transcription and RNA processing resonates with recent developments in the gene expression field as a whole, and provides a unique opportunity to investigate polyadenylation, a vital but understudied regulatory mechanism, in a biologically relevant context. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: <br/>This project will build upon the principal investigator's strong track record of mentoring scientists from diverse backgrounds and at various stages of professional development.  The postdoctoral fellow will play a pivotal role by co-supervising undergraduate and high school students in addition to receiving training in cutting-edge experimental strategies.  The collegial atmosphere in the Center for RNA Molecular Biology at CWRU will help to ensure that broader impact goals are achieved, as will the use of fission yeast, which resembles multicellular eukaryotes at the molecular level, yet is relatively simple to culture and manipulate even by students just beginning bench research.  As in the past, a particular effort will be made to include women and members of groups generally under-represented in scientific research in the project."

Knowing such mechanisms is required for efforts to control disease progression. When a bacterial plant pathogen infects a host, a tug-of-war ensues in which the plant host aims to defend itself against the pathogen; the bacterium in turn responds, often subverting host defenses by utilizing host-derived signals to trigger expression of traits that promote survival and virulence. This project focuses on mechanisms by which bacteria detect and respond to such host-derived signals. In addition, the program integrates research and teaching by offering the opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students to acquire research experience and proficiency in modern molecular biology techniques. Graduate students will be integral to developing these research projects and in disseminating results. For undergraduate students, many of whom will be recruited from programs that promote inclusion and diversity, the opportunities for independent research will complement their regular course curriculum, prepare them for advanced studies, and contribute to the development of a competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Hosts produce reactive oxygen species as a defense against a bacterial infection. One of the enzymes responsible for this oxidative burst is xanthine dehydrogenase, which converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to urate. The first objective of this project is to address the hypothesis that the xanthine and urate that are produced by host plants during a bacterial infection function as diffusible signals to induce differential gene expression in the bacterium. The second goal is to investigate the role of the transcription factor PecS in sensing xanthine and urate and controlling gene expression. A combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq will be implemented to identify the PecS regulon, and phenotypes of pecS mutant strains predicted from RNA-seq data will be determined. Focusing on the plant pathogen Agrobacterium fabrum, the virulence of wild-type and pecS deletion mutant strains will be compared. Defining host-derived signals and the mechanisms by which these diffusible messengers trigger expression of virulence-associated genes in plant pathogens will ultimately facilitate development of antibacterial agents."

Syntrophy refers to the mutually beneficial metabolic interactions of the participating bacteria. These bacteria work as members of small microbial teams that consume decaying plant and animal material and convert it back into the starting materials needed for photosynthesis by plants and algae. The syntrophic bacteria first break down and recycle small organic molecules such as fats, amino acids and small aromatic compounds and make acetic acid (vinegar), water and hydrogen gas. These syntrophic waste products are then used by a second group of microbes called methanogens to make more water plus carbon dioxide and methane. The latter can be harvested as a renewable energy source. By cooperating, both types of microbes are able to obtain energy and grow where neither could alone. This project will use a combination of molecular and biochemical methods to study the unique metabolic skills of each microbe and how they cooperate with one another to optimally recycle waste materials in nature.  This knowledge will assist others to better describe and model the use of carbon on Earth and to predict how our ever-changing environment affects the maintenance of the Earth's life forms (the biosphere).   This knowledge will also improve our ability to recycle unwanted waste materials in the environment. The knowledge obtained will be used develop new web-based and team-based activities that will promote enthusiasm for microbiology to lower and upper level microbiology undergraduates, including those from institutions with a large minority enrollment.<br/><br/><br/>Syntrophic metabolism is a microbial process found in nearly all anaerobic ecosystems yet very little is understood about the molecular, biochemical, or physiological basis of this essential ecological process. Understanding how syntrophic consortia composed of distinct types of bacterial and archaeal species operate at the metabolic and molecular levels is critical to describe and model global carbon cycling and ecosystem function. The hypothesis to be tested states that special metabolic and sensory/regulatory systems are used by syntrophic partners to accomplish their cooperative existence. The model syntrophic co-culture, Syntrophomonas wolfei and Methanospirillum hungatei, will be used to unravel the basic principles governing syntrophic partnership formation and maintenance. A combination of high-throughput technologies including genome-wide transcript and proteomic profiling will be used to identify the metabolic and regulatory networks involved in syntrophic fatty acid catabolism and to delineate other adaptations that may be required to maintain the syntrophic lifestyle. This will reveal the pathways operative in electron flow and hydrogen and/formate production from thermodynamically difficult reactions as well as special biochemical machinery and regulatory controls needed for syntrophic cooperation. These data will provide a foundation to predict and explore related processes in other multispecies microbial communities."

The cells of most non-microbial life forms contain numerous mitochondria, organelles responsible for generating biological energy. Mitochondria contain their own genomes, which are far smaller than ""regular"" nuclear genomes and encode a unique set of genes related to energy metabolism. Proper mitochondrial functioning relies upon many gene products encoded by the nuclear genome. These two genomes must therefore evolve in concert; i.e., mitonuclear coevolution. This research will provide the first comprehensive assessment of nuclear and mitochondrial genomic change accompanying controlled, adaptive evolution under different reproductive systems. It will also result in discovery of novel mutations that suppress the effects of mitonuclear damage. The project will provide important data and resources to the scientific community, expand the PIs' educational and outreach activities, and provide research training and professional development for a postdoctoral fellow, a research technician, and graduate and undergraduate students. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes has long been used for forensic and phylogenetic applications, and defects in mitochondrial genomes are implicated in approximately 1,000 human genetic diseases, cancer and aging. The central importance of mitochondrial genetics and mitonuclear interaction to diverse areas of biological research suggest that this research will have far-reaching impacts.<br/><br/>This research will provide the first direct, non-retrospective tests of major hypotheses to explain mitonuclear genome coevolution. The project will apply experimental genomics with Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to study evolutionary process within the context of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the proper functioning of which relies on the maintenance of favorable mitonuclear epistatic interactions. The project will: 1) Determine the impact of sexual system on the tempo and patterns of mitonuclear adaptation. C. elegans strains containing deleterious mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded ETC mutations will undergo adaptation in replicate populations experiencing obligate selfing, facultative outcrossing, or obligate outcrossing, and 2) Determine the evolutionary dynamics, functional characteristics and sex-specific effects of individual mitonuclear mutations. Genomic, bioinformatic and phenotypic analyses will determine the molecular bases and functional underpinnings of mitochondrial and nuclear mutations available to mask the effects of deleterious ETC mutations, and reveal the relationship between rates of outcrossing and mitonuclear adaptation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address broadly relevant questions about cell cycle regulation. Namely, what is the function of the regulated degradation of crucial cell cycle proteins and how does this regulatory mechanism integrate with other levels of regulation to control the cell cycle?  By addressing these questions, this work has the potential to have a significant impact on our basic understanding of how the cell cycle is regulated.  This project will expose students to interdisciplinary research and allow undergraduate students in summer laboratory courses to be active participants in research.  <br/><br/>The timed synthesis and degradation of specific proteins is a ubiquitous mechanism of cell regulation. However, some proteins can be regulated by covalent modification or binding to an allosteric effector. If a protein's activity can be controlled without the energetic cost of degradation and resynthesis, what circumstances would favor regulation by proteolysis? To address this question, the investigators are studying CtrA, a transcriptional regulator that promotes cell division in Caulobacter, yet also blocks chromosome replication. To reconcile these opposing functions, CtrA activity is temporarily eliminated from the cell just prior to chromosome replication by both dephosphorylation and proteolysis. Caulobacter strains expressing a non-degradable version of CtrA can still initiate chromosome replication, indicating that CtrA activity can be significantly reduced by dephosphorylation alone. However, cells with non-degradable CtrA have subtle defects that may compromise their competitive fitness. During each division cycle, ~9000 CtrA molecules are degraded and resynthesized. To understand the selective advantages conferred by this apparently wasteful strategy, experimental and modeling approaches will be used to predict and test the consequences of regulating CtrA only by phosphorylation. In particular, this study will investigate whether the periodic degradation and resynthesis of a neutral passenger protein confers a competitive disadvantage in Caulobacter, as in other bacteria. Caulobacter strains expressing steady levels of a non-degradable CtrA protein will be used to identify phenotypes that differ from cells with oscillating CtrA levels. Competitive fitness assays and quantitative microscopy approaches will test explicitly the predictions of existing mathematical models, e.g., that cells with non-degradable CtrA experience a delay in chromosome replication and a longer cell division cycle. Existing deterministic and stochastic models of the Caulobacter cell cycle will be revised, taking into account recent published findings. Stochastic spatiotemporal modeling will benefit from single-cell data on times of division, chromosome replication, and protein localization."

Biological systems are characterized by highly complex traits that result from the interplay of much simpler components. One of the major challenges in modern biology is to define the interactions of these basic components in order to arrive at the properties of the full system. Intracellular transport along cytoskeletal filaments represents such a biological system that is tractable with today's technology. Importantly, this transport plays fundamental functions in establishing cell polarity, in mediating growth, and in responding to the environment or to pathogens. Therefore, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying intracellular movements as provided by this project may impact, for example, agricultural yield or treatment of diseases. This project will also establish a paradigm for the cross-disciplinary training of graduate students at the interface of molecular cell biology, computational biophysics, and statistical machine learning. This training will be extended to undergraduate and high school students who will participate in carefully selected research projects appropriate for their background. Broader dissemination of the research findings will occur via a dedicated website as well as through lectures for the general public.<br/><br/>Cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells is characterized by the rapid movement of organelles along the actin cytoskeleton. While it is known that these movements are driven by class XI myosin motor proteins, the precise mechanism for the propulsive mechanism is still debated. One model posits that myosin motors directly associate with individual organelles and pull them actively along actin filaments. Another model proposes that only a few organelles such as the ER directly bind to motors while all other organelles are propelled indirectly by binding to the actively moving organelle(s). A third model predicts that a small number of actively moving organelles generate a hydrodynamic flow in the cytoplasm that transports other organelles passively along this stream. This project will test these motility models by developing a series of rigorous tools to model, measure, and evaluate intracellular dynamics. First, stochastic models will be developed that translate the concepts of the three motility models into explicit biophysical descriptions for computer simulations. Second, novel analytical tools will be developed that are able to capture and describe the complex behavior of organelles in living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. Third, a machine learning approach based on Bayesian considerations will be designed that can evaluate motility models based on experimental data. Combined with novel tools for experimental interference with specific organelle movements and identification of the cellular cargo of two representative myosin XI motors, this research will deliver a new level of understanding of intracellular transport along the cytoskeleton that will impact cell biological interpretations for all eukaryotic systems."

Distributive Conjugal Transfer (DCT) differs from traditional plasmid-based conjugation systems both in creating mosaic genomes and in mechanism, and proteins usually found in plasmid transfer systems are absent from mycobacteria. A mating identity locus (mid), which determines donor or recipient activity, has been mapped to a six-gene cluster embedded within a 25-gene locus that encodes the ESX-1 secretion apparatus.

In the post-genomic era, enhanced understanding of the cooperative interaction between proteins is necessary to explore the complexity of biological processes.  For example, the signaling protein Ras is responsible for propagating a chemical message that leads to, among other things, cell division.  To do this, Ras binds to and interacts with multiple proteins in its lifecycle to switch between ""on"" (signaling) and ""off"" (silent) states. However, the physical mechanisms that drive and stabilize these protein-protein interactions and direct their resulting function are largely unknown. These interactions are enabled by the distribution of weak, but long-range electrostatic fields that are generated by the proteins' structures. Subtle changes in the structure or chemical sequence of a protein that alter these interactions can be devastating; for example, mutations to the human Ras protein that prevent its binding to the appropriate partner leave it permanently in the ""on"" state, causing uncontrolled cell division and tumor growth.  It is believed that a fundamental investigation into the physical mechanisms of the formation and function of Ras-based protein-protein interfaces will have two important outcomes: 1) generation of an entirely new understanding of the function of this specific protein ; and 2) general knowledge about the role of electrostatic fields in protein-protein interactions that can then be applied to a wide variety of other biologically relevant multiprotein complexes. The advanced multidisciplinary nature of this research project will enable the exploration of important questions that arise at the interface of experimental and theoretical chemistry and biology. In the process of achieving these goals, students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in multidisciplinary tools and techniques that will form the foundations of their own scientific careers.<br/><br/>The PI's laboratory utilizes spectroscopic techniques to study the molecular-level mechanisms that generate the electrostatic fields, which in turn determine the formation and specificity of protein-protein interfaces.  The research group has used this technique to study the interactions between normal Ras proteins and their binding partners in the chemical signaling pathway (so called ""effector"" proteins) as a model system for all biologically important protein-protein interfaces.  In this project, the PI will use this technique to investigate the formation of abnormal interfaces of known cancer-causing mutants of Ras with their appropriate effector proteins in order to understand the differences between normal and pathological Ras mutants.  Understanding the detailed mechanisms that are responsible for the formation of an interface between Ras and other proteins and, in particular, how cancerous mutations of Ras alter the function of these interfaces, will provide an entirely new perspective on the role of electrostatic fields in the structure, function, and dynamics of complex, multiprotein assemblies. How electrostatic fields at the protein-protein interface may be altered through the selective binding of small molecules to that interface will also be investigated.  This will be accomplished by focusing on the binding and inhibition of the natural product brefeldin A to the interface of a Ras analog with its downstream effector.

Bioluminescence--the emission of light by living organisms--is a beautiful natural phenomenon that has enchanted children, challenged those who have tried to understand it, and provided the basis for an important research tool.  The project addresses the need to produce novel luciferase proteins to improve current research applications of bioluminescence and to advance the development of new ones. The proposed research will be carried out at a liberal arts college with an established record of effective research training of undergraduate students. Modern facilities and equipment provide an excellent environment for students and faculty to engage in collaborative research.  The PI has actively directed undergraduate research projects for 37 summers. Approximately 98 undergraduate students, approximately 70% of whom are women and approximately 10% who are from traditionally underrepresented groups, have worked with him and approximately 60% of these participants entered graduate or professional school.  Students who work in the PI's lab and make substantive contributions to a project become co-authors and are actively involved in the writing of manuscripts and presenting their results at scientific meetings.  The aim is to offer a meaningful research experience to a diverse group of students. Moreover, several of the students in the proposed program will be participants in a department collaborator's NSF S-STEM grant.  All program participants will engage in modern mainstream bioluminescence research and will contribute positively to increasing the numbers of well-prepared graduates for entry into graduate programs and professional scientific careers. <br/><br/>Two major objectives are addressed in this project that were developed during related investigations with prior NSF-RUI grant support. The first is to determine the basis for the altered emission color (574 nm), resistance to low pH red shifting, and unexpectedly greater specific activity (compared to the brightest North American firefly Photinus pyralis) of a newly cloned luciferase from Photinus scintillans.  The main aim is to better understand the natural determinants of firefly emission color and pH stability through mutagenesis studies of the enzymes from both species.  The PI will fully characterize the physical and spectral properties of the new enzyme and undertake biochemical studies to identify key amino acid residues that determine the enhanced properties. The proposed investigation will involve a mutagenesis approach and variants of the enzymes will be studied by: steady state kinetics, quantitative analysis of bioluminescence reaction products, and spectral methods including fluorescence and bioluminescence emission techniques. With collaborator Professor Andrew Gulick, the crystal structure of a complex of the novel luciferase with DLSA, an inhibitor that binds to the active site, will be determined and the mutagenesis data will be interpreted in a structural context.  The second objective is to develop new substrates and red-emitting luciferase variants for improved dual color (analyte) reporter gene applications. The plan is to seek new assay methodology with greater convenience of performance and enhanced sensitivity compared to current technology.   The PI will use 2 luciferase variants and 2 bioluminescence-producing substrates-- beetle luciferin and a novel analog called benzothiophene luciferin. Additionally, the PI may explore the use of fluorine-containing derivatives of benzothiophene luciferin to be made by synthetic routes that have been designed. The 2 luciferase variants are engineered to produce well-separated green (~520 nm) and red (~617 nm) emission spectra.  The PI will use several mutagenesis strategies to produce enzymes that produce light with further separated emission maxima. The assays will be optimized with respect to pH, signal stabilizers, lysing agents, substrate concentrations and spectral filters."

Rhodopsin is the major GPCR involved in vision, and serves as an archetype for determining molecular movies of receptors in action.  Research will investigate the light activation mechanism of visual rhodopsin extracted from the retinal rod disk membranes into detergent micelles or small lipid nanodiscs. To monitor the protein shape and motion, the project will apply powerful new X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) technology.  The goal is to study how light affects the protein shape and internal motions of rhodopsin over a range of different time scales.  The significance and impact are twofold.  First, it will illuminate the earliest events and photophysics of light activation process that occur in our eyes, together with the protein changes that yield vision.  Second, it will showcase and drive the application of the new XFEL technology to membrane proteins that are not amenable to standard crystallization approaches.  The primary benefit is to understand how light absorption by visual rhodopsin leads to changes in its mobility followed by transmission of a nerve signal to the brain.  Time-resolved X-ray studies of rhodopsin in detergent solutions will reveal the protein motions triggered by light absorption of its cofactor (retinal, a derivative of Vitamin A).  Computer simulations will further interpret the experimental observations in terms of changes in the dynamics of the protein molecules due to light.  Important broader outcomes include training of biophysical scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate student, undergraduate, and high school levels, as well as teachers who will influence our society over many years to come.<br/><br/> <br/>The goals and scope of the research involve time-resolved X-ray scattering studies of the light activation of rhodopsin in detergent solutions and lipid nanodiscs.  Changes in the structural dynamics of rhodopsin due to its photoactivation will be established over multiple scales of time and space: from sub picoseconds (10 C12 s) up to milliseconds (10 C3 s), and from chemical bond lengths up to entire protein molecules.  Visual light from an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) will be used as the pump, with the short intense X-ray pulses of an XFEL as the probe.  Pump-probe studies will establish how the ultrafast conformational changes of rhodopsin are propagated by a multiscale mechanism into the activated state of the receptor.  The cofactor-induced changes in protein dynamics in the Photorhodopsin and Bathorhodopsin intermediates will be probed from the picosecond up to the nanosecond time scales to discover whether a ""protein quake"" occurs immediately after the initial light absorption. We will then study how the initial protein quake is propagated into the large-scale conformational fluctuations that activate rhodopsin.  The Lumi and Meta-I states will be studied in the run-up to the active Meta-II state. We will discover how cis Ctrans isomerization of the retinal chromophore is focused to the dynamical hot spots of rhodopsin, which yield the activating conformational changes.  Quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics (QM/MM) simulations will compare the theoretical difference-scattering profiles to experimental solution X-ray data to connect the light-induced changes to the atomic-resolution structure.  Lastly, we will investigate binding of the C-terminal helix of the G-protein transducin in relation to the structural and dynamical alterations.  Establishing how the ultrafast changes from light-induced isomerization of retinal are coupled to the large-scale protein fluctuations will greatly improve our understanding of rhodopsin activation and its role in visual signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In all organisms, gene expression is controlled, or regulated, by crosstalk between proteins called transcription factors and specific small regions in the DNA that bind the transcription factors (transcription factor binding sites.)  A key to understanding this crosstalk is learning the precise nature of the ""regulatory vocabulary"" of transcription factor binding sites which potentially varies among organisms.  This project will focus on deciphering the regulatory language in multiple species of the single-celled protozoan Paramecium, a well-established model system in cell biology. The overall project will advance the formal training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, while also establishing a set of molecular resources for the international research community. Specific efforts are being made to organize and integrate all genomic and gene-expression results into a web repository that will allow users to readily query data for dozens of Paramecium species to acquire information about status and evolutionary history of all known genes. The scientific and training results from this project will help promote the growth of the field of evolutionary cell biology, thereby broadening our understanding of the diversity of cellular functions across the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Much of biological diversity owes its origin to gene duplication and modifications in gene regulatory patterns.  The Paramecium system is well-suited to studying the impacts of gene duplication because the evolution of this genus included two complete-genome duplications that led to the establishment of a clade of distantly related but nearly morphologically identical species. This situation is of broad interest because two rounds of genome duplication are also thought to have preceded the emergence and diversification of the major vertebrate lineages. With complete sequences now available for most Paramecium species, and the evolutionary history of each gene known, the next goal is to determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for differential gene expression and the evolutionary mechanisms associated with differential gene survival. Using a set of efficient methods for discovering transcription factor binding sites, this project will elucidate the evolutionary history of the gene-regulation vocabulary over the billion-year history of the genus Paramecium. Comparisons among lineages that did or did not undergo complete-genome duplications will help define the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are altered in the face of massive gene duplication. Paramecium shares some key features with animals, such as harboring a transcriptionally silent germline genome as well as an active somatic nucleus, all within the confines of a single, highly complex cell. Thus, results of these studies in the Paramecium, which is exceptionally easy to manipulate, may shed light on the evolution of regulatory diversity in other organisms that are not as experimentally tractable."

The shape of proteins is extraordinarily important because it determines biological activity. However, little is known about how proteins achieve their bioactive three-dimensional shape inside the living cell. This research will elucidate how proteins gain their precise fold from the earliest stages of their life, from the time they are made a by a complex machine known as the ribosome. The role of the ribosome and molecular helpers known as chaperones will be explored. Molecular movies, showing folding as a function of time, will be generated to watch the microscopic details of the folding process in real time. This research will foster the participation of several underrepresented graduate students, and will be a benchmark to learn advanced biophysical techniques as well as the mechanisms of protein folding in the cell. In addition, classroom demonstrations showing illustrative renderings of the protein folding and unfolding processes will be developed, providing unprecedented opportunities for active learning and for undergraduate student participation in the classroom. As part of the broader impacts of this project, campus pre-visits for minority and disadvantaged undergraduate students will also be organized, to encourage them to pursue graduate studies.<br/><br/>Despite the extensive literature available on the folding of purified proteins upon dilution from denaturant and upon temperature-jump, there is very little information on how proteins fold in the cellular environment, where chaperones, molecular crowding and the ribosome can profoundly affect the sequence and nature of the events leading to bioactive proteins. This project addresses the earliest stages of folding in the cellular context, as proteins emerge from the ribosome. The role of nascent chain compaction and thermodynamic stability, together with the effect of the ribosomal surface and the rate of full-length protein release from the ribosome, will be addressed at the molecular level. Experiments will be carried out by a combination of molecular-biology and biophysical techniques, including fluorescence depolarization and pulsed proteolysis on wild-type and rationally designed variants of the E. coli globin apoHmpH and on other control nascent proteins. Data will be collected in the absence and presence of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones, to assess the role played by each of these folding facilitators. The specific interaction between the ribosomal surface and nascent proteins will be assessed as function of ionic strength. The rate of release of ribosome-bound nascent proteins will be followed in real time to gain high-resolution insights into the events accompanying protein birth. Overall, this project will lead to an improved understanding of intracellular protein folding, one of the most fascinating aspects of gene expression."

Iron is an essential nutrient that is actively acquired by bacteria from human hemoglobin during infections. A key step in microbial iron acquisition is the extraction of iron-laden heme from hemoglobin. Using biophysical and computational approaches the investigators will learn how the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses the IsdH surface receptor to extract heme from hemoglobin. This process is clinically important, as it enables methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to cause infections. The results of this work will provide a detailed view of the mechanism underlying extraction and it will have a broad impact as other bacterial pathogens also use a similar mechanism to acquire iron during infections.  The proposal will facilitate undergraduate and graduate student outreach programs of students from under-represented groups at the PhD level. The grant will be used to support outreach efforts to community college students and promote diversity, inclusion, and the elimination of barriers to participation in bioscience research careers.<br/><br/>In this project a team of investigators will apply computational and experimental methodologies to decipher the structural, dynamic and energetic basis through which the Staphylococcus aureus IsdH protein extracts heme from human hemoglobin (Hb). This process is highly conserved and used by many bacterial species to obtain the essential nutrient iron. Recent structural data and newly developed experimental tools make IsdH a powerful model system in which to explore the heme extraction mechanism. The overall goal of this research project is to elucidate how heme is transferred from Hb to IsdH, and to learn how this process is facilitated by inter-domain motions. In Aim #1, simulations and experiments will define the pathway of heme transfer, and uncover specific receptor contacts that facilitate transfer and distort Hb to trigger heme release. In Aim #2, the role of inter-domain motions will be determined by quantitatively assessing their effect on the local concentration of the receptor, and the kinetics and thermodynamics of transfer. Because IsdH is paradigmatic, the results of this project will provide broad insight into the extraction mechanisms used by a wide-range of bacteria."

Altered GA production or responses in cereal crops, e.g., the dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice, greatly increased the grain yields during the ""Green Revolution"" in the 1960s-1970s. These examples illustrate the importance of this hormone in regulating plant development and in agriculture. GA-promoted plant development is modulated by DELLA proteins, which are master growth repressors that integrate multiple cellular pathways in response to environmental cues (such as light conditions, pathogens, cold and drought stresses). Although DELLA plays such a central role in regulating diverse plant growth processes, very little is known about how DELLA controls multiple pathways and how DELLA activity is dynamically regulated. This project will focus on these two important aspects and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. This research will facilitate more effective strategies to manipulate plant growth and stress responses for agricultural improvements since DELLAs are highly conserved in plants. This research project will also have a broad impact in training young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and four undergraduate students.<br/><br/> Recent studies indicate that DELLAs function as central regulators of multiple signaling pathways by direct protein-protein interactions with key transcription factors (TFs). DELLAs do not contain a DNA-binding domain, and are likely to repress expression of target genes by sequestering their interacting TFs. DELLAs can also activate transcription by binding to specific TFs. However, the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression remains unclear. Preliminary results from the principal investigator's laboratory showed that two missense mutations in a specific subdomain of RGA (an Arabidopsis thaliana DELLA) did not affect interaction with TFs. Instead, they were impaired in binding histone and an epigenetic regulator. These results raise an exciting possibility that histone binding may enhance DELLA association with the target chromatin, and DELLA may recruit epigenetic regulators to induce chromatin structural changes. This working model will be tested in Specific Aim 1. The roles of different subdomains in RGA will be defined by analyzing the effects of additional missense rga alleles on binding to TFs, histone, and epigenetic regulators using yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays, and association with target chromatin by ChIP-qPCR. DELLA activity needs to be strictly modulated in response to internal and external cues, and it is known that GA induces DELLA degradation. Recent studies also indicated that DELLA activity is dynamically modulated by post-translational modifications. Preliminary data indicate that DELLA phosphorylation is altered under GA-deficient conditions, although the role of this modification remains unclear. Specific Aim 2 will identify phosphosites in RGA by MS analysis, and characterize functions of potential protein kinases for these modifications by genetic and biochemical analyses. This research project will shed new light on the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression, and elucidate the role of phosphorylation in fine-tuning DELLA activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Circadian clock genes produce proteins that are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. These proteins also regulate genes involved in either cell division or cell death. Agitation in the balance between cell division and cell death will lead to cellular dysfunction. In this project, the investigator will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines biological, mathematical, and bioengineering tools, to examine the circadian factors that act as mediators in the interconnected network that controls the circadian clock.  This project includes an educational component that will recruit, retain, train, and graduate a more academically prepared student body with a global vision of interdisciplinary research and world opportunities, creating a new sense of leadership. <br/><br/>This project uses multidisciplinary and complementary methods to establish signature events that modulate the effect of genotoxic stress in both cell division and circadian phase resetting across length scales from molecular to cellular systems. Initially, the study will focus on intracellular events that dynamically adapt themselves to genotoxic or physiological challenges to what cells are exposed to. Then, the study will shift toward understanding how redistribution of clock and checkpoint players influence the clock itself and promotes resetting. To accomplish this goal, the investigator will integrate diverse experimental observations and measurements into mathematical models that simulate concrete and realistic experiments, reconcile measurements and current data, and illuminate how different components cooperate to produce a particular behavior. Lastly, additional experiments will be designed to explore the influence of the microenvironment and systemic factors in the clock response to genotoxic stress and to the circadian behavior of multi-cell arrangements in three-dimensional substrates. As a result, the investigator proposes to: (1) determine how spatial/temporal organization of circadian components modulates the cellular response to genotoxic stress and provokes clock resetting; and (2) study the behavior of circadian oscillatory systems challenged by genotoxic stress in 3D biomimetic environments. The transition to a system that more closely resembles physiological conditions will expose additional critical parameters and provide a more comprehensive map of crosstalk mechanisms, help predict network connections, and generate new testable hypotheses."

Communication among cells is critical for most, if not all, living systems and regulates processes including cell migration, cell division, growth, and death. One way this occurs is though a process called endocytosis whereby molecules are transported into the cell. Endocytosis requires an intricate coordination of proteins inside the cell as well as physical changes to the surface of the cell. The deformation of the cell's surface is central to endocytosis, yet there are few tools that can dissect these physical changes that are necessary for endocytosis. One reason this is difficult to study is that this processes is dynamic and occurs on the nanoscale, beyond the resolution of traditional microscopy. This project will advance the study of nanometer scale cell surface dynamics by developing and applying new methods to measure and manipulate the process of endocytosis in living cells. Many biological processes occur on this scale, and the methods developed in this research will be widely applicable across a range of biological systems including virus entry and budding, cell migration, and neurobiology.  In addition to contributing to understanding cellular processes, the effort will include training students from K-12 through graduate school on microscopy and the value of multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding cellular processes. <br/>The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of endocytic vesicle assembly and the interconnected roles played by the proteins involved, as well as the physical changes to plasma membrane shape. A recently developed fluorescence microscopy technique is uniquely suited to imaging nanometer dynamics of vesicle formation in real-time in living cells. In Aim 1 the novel microscopy technique is used to measure endocytic pit formation dynamics upon stimulation with EGF. This experimental platform will then be used to dissect the protein dynamics during pit formation, mapping the correlation between protein dynamics and plasma membrane morphology (Aim 2). Finally, a strategy will be developed to physically stall endocytosis utilizing a tethered ligand. This platform will be used to explore curvature sensing and curvature inducing proteins (Aim 3). This research will yield a quantitative description of ligand internalization dynamics and the interplay between protein recruitment and membrane morphology on a millisecond time scale. Completion of this research will shed light on previously undiscovered mechanisms of plasma membrane dynamics and signaling that may revolutionize the way cellular communication is understood. Further, it will provide new tools to broadly improve the understanding of plasma membrane dynamics in cell signaling and homeostasis.

One platform cells use to sense and respond to stretch is the cytoskeleton.  This meshwork of multiple different proteins gives a cell its shape, yet is constructed in a way that allows flexibility and motion.  This research is focused on the role that the cytoskeletal protein obscurin plays in stretch response and recognition.  Obscurin acts like a tether, connecting far-away segments of the cell to each other.  Due to its shape, obscurin has the capacity to expand and contract.  There are two possibilities of how obscurin could move like this.  Obscurin could behave like a rope, and only resist stretch when significantly elongated, or obscurin could behave like a spring, and resist an ever-increasing amount of force as it is stretched.  Obscurin also can propagate biochemical signals, and there is circumstantial evidence that this function could be activated by stretch.  The PI will test both facets of obscurin function - stretch response and signaling.  Together, these studies will provide insight into how cells passively and actively respond to physical stretch. This work will be conducted primarily by undergraduate students, in an effort to train the next generation of scientists.  The data accrued here will be incorporated into a free education website, where others who do not have access to significant research support can also learn the technical skills of how to do this kind of research.  Additionally, the PI will develop a scientific ethics curriculum for undergraduates.<br/> <br/>Specifically, the investigator will study how obscurin reacts to physical stretch using both cellular and in vitro models.

In Aim 1, the PI will characterize how these domains act in groups of two or three.   Using protein NMR techniques, the cross-talk between neighboring domains will be measured.  Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provide a dynamic model of obscurin's overall shape.  These experimental approaches will be complimented through computer simulations to test how these multi-domain systems respond to stretch.   Together, these experiments will detail how obscurin resists force.  In Aim two, the PI will test what effect obscurin has on the whole cell when the cell is stretched.  Cells with and without obscurin will be stretched, and the biochemical consequences of obscurin's presence in these conditions will be analyzed.  Together, these two aims will help define how obscurin behaves as a stretch resistor, and will answer the question of whether or not obscurin is a mechanosensor."

This workshop is instrumental in making progress in the development of standards in synthetic biology. Currently, most standardization efforts are either unfunded or only have very limited support. The success of these standards hinges on the donation of time from many individuals to participate in discussions, write specifications, serve as standards editors, and attend workshops. Many of these individuals working on the development of standards are students based in the US who would find it difficult to find the funds to attend this meeting. Therefore, this award helps support travel, lodging, and registration expenses for US based students working on systems and synthetic biology standards. Not only would this be a valuable experience for these participants, but it would also greatly enhance the COMBINE goal of bringing together researchers in synthetic biology with those working in systems biology leading to integrated standards and shared software and infrastructure.<br/><br/>Standards for data exchange are critical to the development of any field since they enable researchers and practitioners to exchange information reliably, apply a variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce scientific results.

Further, the researchers will investigate how nanoscale protein motions influence the kinetics of protein-protein association.  This research will improve our understanding of the role of nanoscale protein motions.

The MR complex is involved in the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are among the most harmful forms of DNA damage and their improper repair may lead to cellular dysfunction or death.  The completion of this project is expected to provide insights into how organisms maintain their genetic material over many generations in the face of internal and external DNA damaging agents.   This project will also provide high quality training experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  The PI actively participates in several internship programs with the goal of increasing the diversity of talented individuals choosing science as a career.  The PI is partnering with the Science Bound program at Iowa State University and will create a laboratory module for visiting high school students that involves UV-induced DNA damage and repair.  Finally, the PI is working to increase scientific literacy by developing and teaching introductory science lecture and laboratory courses designed for non-science majors.<br/>   <br/>The overall objective of this research project is to define the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the MR complex.  Previous studies carried out in the PI's lab strongly suggest that the underlying mechanisms that operate in the MR complex are well conserved among homologs.  It was found that the nuclease activity of the bacteriophage T4 MR complex can be altered depending on the nature of the divalent cation used.  While Mn2+ supports a robust 3' to 5' dsDNA exonuclease activity, Mg2+ may support a more physiologically relevant nuclease activity.  A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments will be carried out with the goal of determining the identity of the divalent cation used by Mre11 to perform its activity in vivo.   The PI has proposed that the Rad50 coiled-coil domain alternates between ring-like and parallel conformational states, which are driven by the ATP hydrolysis cycle and serve to regulate the ATPase and nuclease activities of the complex.  A combination of biophysical techniques that report on the conformation and dynamics of the coiled-coil domain will be employed to test this hypothesis.  The entire ensemble of conformational states that the coiled-coil adopts and their rates of interconversion will be determined.  Similar methods will be used to monitor conformational changes in Mre11 and to determine how these are controlled by the activity of Rad50.  The results of these studies are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of the MR complex and how its activities are coordinated during DSB repair."

Because genes are responsible for essentially all aspects of cell and organismal biology, ranging from how cells divide to how animals respond to hormones, these studies will shed new light into processes of broad biological importance.  The project will also have a wide-reaching impact on the education of undergraduate students through the implementation of several initiatives.  First, 12 undergraduate students will be directly involved in several aspects of the research.  These students will be mentored by Dr. Duina and will be trained in a variety of laboratory and scientific skills.  Second, 30-50 undergraduate students will carry out part of this research in the context of a course Dr. Duina teaches at Hendrix College.  These students will be engaged in the excitement of science through an authentic research experience in the classroom.  Third, students in Dr. Duina's laboratory will present their research to their peers majoring in disciplines other than the sciences.  These sessions are designed to teach science students how to communicate science to the lay public as well as to expose non-scientists to the thrill of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>This research will focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the transcription elongation factor Spt16 interacts with transcribed genes in vivo. Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is compacted through the formation of a protein-DNA complex known as chromatin, the fundamental unit of which is the nucleosome.  Nucleosomes consist of a short stretch of DNA wrapped around histone octamers, themselves composed of pairs of the four core histone proteins.  Nucleosomes represent physical barriers during the process of gene transcription and Spt16, as part of the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, has been shown to play central roles in overcoming these barriers.  In this project, Dr. Duina's laboratory will use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and targeted proteomic approaches to assess contributions of DNA sequences, histone modifications, histones, and other proteins in regulating physical interactions between Spt16 and transcribed genes.  The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used for this project, and given the high degree of evolutionary conservation in the factors and processes under investigation, results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of a process relevant to all eukaryotic organisms, including humans.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Some of these compartments, such as the nucleus and mitochondria, are separated from the rest of the cell by membranes. Others, termed membraneless organelles, lack any obvious physical boundary from the rest of the cell. It was recently discovered that many membraneless organelles are actually liquid droplets formed by intracellular phase separation. This project will investigate the consequences of droplet formation on biochemical reactions and how cells could take advantage of droplet-forming phase transitions to regulate biochemical pathways. The findings will uncover new paradigms for intracellular organization and enable new classes of artificial microscale bioreactors that incorporate such organization. The project will directly impact students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, who will perform this research at the intersection of chemistry, biology, physics and materials science. By involving K-12 teachers it will also reach high school and middle school students. Small teams of teachers will work in the Principal Investigator's laboratory each summer developing grade-level appropriate hands-on content in emulsion science. Back in their classrooms, implementation of this new content will engage middle and high school students with current scientific progress and its connection to their everyday lives. Emulsions where droplets of one phase are suspended in another liquid phase are common in consumer products such as salad dressings or sunscreens, and can be used to illustrate fundamental principles in multiple disciplines including chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and food science. The Principal Investigator and graduate students will also aid in development of chemistry content for a K-12 education approach being developed by colleagues in the Education department to facilitate high-level science comprehension.<br/><br/>Liquid-liquid phase coexistence, which causes biomolecule-rich aqueous droplets termed coacervates to form in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells, has only recently been realized as a pervasive organizational motif for membraneless organelles, and is not yet well understood. This project will provide new insight into physicochemical driving forces underlying intracellular organization by liquid-liquid phase coexistence, as well as potential consequences of coexisting peptide-rich phases for biochemical reactions. Non-uniform solute distribution between coexisting phase compartments (coacervate droplets) will impact the rates of biochemical reactions, providing a mechanism to control reaction rates via droplet formation and dissolution. Post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation and methylation events in intrinsically disordered regions of key proteins, are thought to be a major mechanism for regulating the formation and dissolution of membraneless organelles. This project will use serine phosphorylation and arginine methylation to control phase separation in peptide-based model systems, as a means of regulating the rates of enzymatic reactions. This project has three research objectives: (1) Evaluate mechanisms for reaction control by droplet formation/dissolution. (2) Develop biomimetic peptide coacervate system that responds to arginine methylation. (3) Evaluate the hypothesis that spatial and temporal occurrence of distinct droplet phases can be controlled by different post-translational modifications, and provides a means of selectively modulating enzymatic reactions."

DNA repair proteins exist in all organisms to remove damaged DNA and protect the integrity of the genome. This research aims to understand at the atomic level how DNA repair proteins locate a particular type of DNA damage and initiate the process of fixing it. This program will enhance the educational benefits to society through 1) integration of research and education in the laboratory and the classroom, 2) vertical integration at all levels of training--from undergraduates to postdoctoral associates, 3) practical structural biology experience for undergraduates, 4) community outreach, and 5) participation by women and underrepresented groups, and 6) integration of science and art to enhance scientific communication. The close proximity of the College of Arts and Science and the School of Medicine at Vanderbilt University provides an exceptional collaborative training environment. Practical hands-on X-ray crystallography laboratory modules have been incorporated into the PI's courses to provide students with the unique opportunity to directly participate in all aspects of protein structure determination. All personnel associated with this research are involved in recruiting students from underrepresented groups from regional institutions, and the PI is involved in outreach through interactions with local high, middle, and elementary school students.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms by which DNA repair enzymes locate and repair aberrant DNA. This research focuses on the structures and functions of a relatively new superfamily of DNA glycosylases, represented by the Bacillus cereus AlkD enzyme, that catalyzes the excision of cationic alkylated DNA nucleobases, including N3-methyladenine (3mA) and N7-methylguanine (7mG), which are among the most prevalent forms of DNA damage. Because of their inherent instability, the basis for recognition and removal of cationic alkylbases from DNA is unknown. The AlkD-related enzymes are unique in that they are the only DNA glycosylases specific for cationic lesions and with the ability to excise bulky modifications. Additionally, these enzymes are constructed from a tandem helical repeat architecture that has emerged as an important nucleic acid processing platform in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response proteins. The PI's group has established that unlike other DNA glycosylases, AlkD does not need to flip the nucleobase target out of the DNA duplex prior to catalysis. Thus, the AlkD superfamily is an ideal system to study the fundamental requirements for base excision repair of alkylation damage repair, with strong potential to reveal novel mechanistic insight into DNA damage recognition. Four specific aims will integrate structural and computational biology, biochemistry, and genetic approaches to 1) determine the physicochemical features that underlie recognition and excision of cationic N3- and N7-alkylpurines, 2) elucidate the diversity among the AlkC/D superfamily that defines substrate specificity, 3) investigate how this unique damage recognition platform can excise bulky DNA adducts, and 4) understand the apparent redundancy between alkylpurine DNA glycosylase activities in Bacillus and to determine if AlkD participates in alternative repair pathways."

Animal cells contain specialized structures, called organelles, which are bounded by a membrane and perform specific functions critical for cell survival. The most prominent organelle in animal cells is the nucleus that houses the cell's genetic material and protects it from damage. Exciting observations in the past few years of metastatic cancer cells and immune cells migrating in vitro have shown that cell nuclei can rupture and be damaged severely, however surprisingly cells can repair the nucleus and the cell can continue to live.  With this award, the PI will study inside how, a living organism, the nucleus performs its protective function.

This work will reveal the basic principles of how the nucleus encases and protects the cell's genetic material, which is essential to cell and organismal survival. During the project period, an interactive hands-on workshop that is part of the Yale Pathways to Science Program will provide local high school students an authentic research experience enabling them to see the purpose of using model organisms in science discovery and solving societal problems. The goal of the workshop is to provide URM and female students that have traditionally had their thoughts underrepresented in the sciences a lens into the daily life and excitement of a scientist and, ultimately, help them gain confidence and motivation to persist in the sciences.

In contrast to the textbook description of the nuclear envelope as a static barrier between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, the nuclear envelope is highly dynamic and undergoes local membrane remodeling such as membrane budding, fusion, rupture and repair, as well as global membrane remodeling in open mitosis. Transient nuclear ruptures are a type of local remodeling in which a region of the nuclear envelope ruptures and is subsequently resealed to restore genome compartmentalization. Little is known about how the nuclear envelope prevents ruptures, and promotes repair of ruptures to ensure genome protection, especially in vivo. The objective of this research project is to define the underlying principles of nuclear rupture and repair in a living, intact organism. The research will use the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, a simple, transparent nematode that undergoes invariant development allowing for quantitative analysis of nuclear envelope dynamics during cellular and tissue morphogenesis. The research project will also employ a combination of innovative laser cutting tools, mathematical predictions, and RNAi-mediated perturbations.

Proteins are the most complex molecules known.  This project will use pressure to examine the molecular determinants of stability and other fundamental properties of proteins.  One goal is to understand why the structure of proteins, and in particular, the presence of empty cavities inside the protein, renders them sensitive to pressure.   These cavities are involved in many important biochemical processes, such as enzymatic catalysis (enzymes are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions), thus it is important to understand properties such as their volume, whether they are empty or whether water is found inside them, how they change over the course of functional processes, and how they affect the essential communication between different parts of the protein.   Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained in computational and experimental biophysics.   Dr. Garca-Moreno is actively engaged in the development of a modern science curriculum focused on the training of biology students in more physical, computational and quantitative approaches.  He also has been very active and will continue to be engaged in his role as mentor and advisor to students from many groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Proteins can be unfolded with pressure.  This implies that the net volume of the unfolded state is smaller than the volume of the folded state.  The origins of these volume differences are not obvious.  This project is focused on fundamental and systematic studies of cavities and pressure unfolding of proteins, with emphasis on the roles of cavities as determinants of pressure unfolding and on the properties of the cavities.   One goal is to examine the relationship between the size, character, state of hydration and location of cavities, and a protein's sensitivity to pressure, its thermodynamic stability, and the magnitude of volume change measured upon unfolding.  A second goal is to study the effects of cavities on fluctuations and correlated motions, on dynamics in the hydrophobic interior, on structural cooperativity, and on internal hydration.  The experiments that will be performed for this project will further fundamental understanding of structural and thermodynamic consequences of cavities in proteins, especially under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure.  The approach that will be pursued involves equilibrium thermodynamic experiments to measure volume changes with pressure unfolding monitored by Trp fluorescence and high pressure NMR, measurement of thermodynamic stability with chemical denaturation, x-ray crystallography to determine crystal structures of proteins to describe the location and volume of internal cavities, and MD simulations to examine the state of hydration of cavities and structural consequences of the application of pressure.  High pressure NMR spectroscopy will also be used to examine the response of proteins to pressure with atomic resolution, by characterizing the pressure dependence of fast backbone and side chain dynamics. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

These processes in turn regulate relocation of biomolecules within different regions of the cell, speed up biochemical reactions, turn on and off gene expression, and aid the correct folding of other proteins. The relationship between three-dimensional structures and function of biomolecules alone is insufficient to fully explain the molecular basis of these processes. Biomolecules are not static but inherently flexible, and the role of biomolecular motions in the regulation of biological functions has remained unclear, despite an increasing number of experimental and theoretical studies. The inability to separate out the contributions of different factors to overall function is at the heart of the problem. The goal of this research project is to establish the molecular basis of the motions of biomolecules involved in biological processes. Computational tools that are developed will be publicly available and implemented into widely used open computational software for anyone to use and improve upon. The research will provide an excellent opportunity to attract and train the next generation of scientists. An advantage of the research is that it cuts across many disciplines, including chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science, and, therefore, provides an excellent opportunity to attract students into the sciences and scientific research. <br/><br/>The relationship between structure and function in biomolecules is well established, however, this information is not always adequate to provide a complete understanding of the mechanism of biomolecular processes. The relationship between structure, dynamics and function in allostery and enzyme mechanisms is therefore far from being fully understood. Critical barriers to progress are the lack of fundamental understanding of the role of dynamical motions in biomolecular function and the inability to experimentally describe temporal behaviors of biomolecules at atomic resolution. The goal of this project is to establish the molecular basis of dynamical and allosteric regulation in biological systems involving cooperative substrate binding and transient protein-protein interactions in complex biomolecular assemblies. Specifically, the research uses theory and computer simulations as complementary tools to a variety of experiments, including NMR, X-ray crystallography and Surface Plasmon Resonance, to understand allosteric regulation in a multi-domain enzyme, Pin1, and a transcription factor co-regulator Pirin. The main objectives are to identify dynamical networks of residue-residue interactions that regulate function, to describe their characteristics on a quantitative level, and to explore computational approaches to access long time scale dynamics, overcoming limitations of traditional direct simulation methods. Computational investigation of the above systems in atomic detail will allow understanding of how modulation in dynamics in one region is communicated via a dynamical network of amino acid residues to a spatially distal region. The research will enhance the incorporation of biomolecular dynamics in interpreting experimental results. The research will provide the fundamental knowledge needed to establish the relationship between dynamics, structure, and function in sub-cellular processes.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

The basic DNA instructions for life are shared among plants, animals and even simpler organisms, as is the basic way DNA is processed into RNA, the functional code of instructions for all cells. Only very recently, a new feature of this process was discovered: copies of DNA can be processed into circular RNA molecules, which are sometimes remarkably abundant in cells, and have features that suggest they have important functions. Research into circular RNA will benefit the public by increasing scientific knowledge of basic mechanisms of genome evolution and function. The research will be disseminated to the public through seminars, publications and by directly integrating the research projects with educational programs aimed at high school, undergraduate and graduate students with a focus on groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in science. In addition, the integration of experimental, statistical and computational approaches in this research will serve as a template for development of a core class aimed at graduate students to teach the principles of statistics to biologists and the principles of biology to statistically trained students.<br/><br/>Circular RNA is a novel class of RNA in different organisms. It is likely to be generated in a pathway linked to RNA splicing, suggesting tha suggests that splicing may have functions apart from excising introns to generate mature mRNAs that code for protein.

This project will directly investigate circular RNA in unicellular eukaryotes where RNA processing is known to be complex and play important functional roles. Using the opportunities provided by recent technological advances in sequencing, the project will entail developing novel statistical and computational approaches coupled with new experimental designs to increase the understanding of circular RNA biogenesis and function.

Ribosomes read genetic information by latching onto a long string-like molecule messenger RNA that contains the genetic instructions for one single protein molecule. The ribosome must convert the language of RNA into the language of protein. To accomplish this, the ribosome employs another class of RNA molecules called transfer RNA molecules, which convert the RNA alphabet into the protein alphabet. Much of ribosome research over the past 40 years has focused on the movement of transfer RNAs through the ribosome; however, the precise molecular mechanism has eluded researchers. It is only recently, with powerful supercomputers, single molecule imaging, and relevant atomic resolution structures, that this question can be addressed in atomic detail. Understanding how the ribosome works may lead to breakthroughs in the development of bio-inspired nanoscale computers, helping to fuel the nanotech industry. Understanding the ribosome may also lead to new insights into the origin of life and the origin of the genetic code. Broader impact of the project include teaching and learning in concert with discovery by training two graduate students.

Simulations will be performed to understand the global motions of the ribosome occurring during head swivel. Detailed simulations will produce predictions for the energy landscape of head swivel. Fluorescent labels will be placed on the ribosome to monitor head swivel as a function of time using single molecule experiments.

Controlled modification of biomolecules enables scientists to explore living systems, engineer new biological functions and generate new biomaterials. Currently the speed and selectivity of the reactions that modify (label) proteins in living and non-living systems limit the ability to study protein dynamics, processing and interactions as well as to engineer novel protein function. Development of an ideal reaction for labeling proteins that is selective in biological conditions and is fast enough to compete with natural biological processes will overcome many of the current limitations. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins and they are inserted in a precisely defined sequence during protein synthesis. Thus, genetically encoding a modified amino acid that contains the needed labeling reaction components and is incorporated into a protein allows for site-specific modification of proteins and enables many new research avenues and potential biotechnological applications.  In this project, a modified amino acid carrying a tetrazine group (which meets the demands of an ideal labeling reaction) will be incorporated into proteins.  The speed and specificity of reaction of this tetrazine-protein in both living and non-living systems permits coupling with a variety of markers targeted for different selected functions. This platform for expansion of the genetic code will be incorporated into undergraduate courses as an approach to teaching chemical biology and to illustrate how engineering the chemical modification of biopolymers is both possible and critical for understanding and manipulating their function.  An annual workshop will be held for high school science teachers and researchers (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate)  to learn genetic code expansion methodology. <br/><br/>The ideal bioorthogonal ligation will be developed and key functional groups will be site-specifically incorporated into proteins via genetic code expansion.

Tetrazine-amino acids will also be genetically incorporated into eukaryotes and prokaryotes and characterized. Tetrazine-protein stability and reaction rates will be measured for labeling and dimerizing proteins in vivo at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of label. This reaction has the potential to transform protein studies and protein engineering because it will be quantitative in vivo on biological time scales of seconds to minutes and at biological concentrations of tetrazine-protein and label. To demonstrate the utility of this bioorthogonal labeling reaction in vivo, key functions integral to two-component signaling systems will be switched on and off with precise control to understand their mechanism of regulating transcription.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Membrane-less organelles, instead, are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of macromolecules (like proteins) that coalesce to form liquid-like droplets and organelles that are not surrounded by lipid membranes. Deciphering the biophysical rules governing the assembly and disassembly of these membrane-less organelles is necessary to understanding their cellular functions. This project will establish ubiquilin proteins as a model system by which the LLPS assembly and disassembly will be studied. Ubiquilins are proteins that regulate protein quality control mechanisms inside cells. The broader impact of this project will lead to the development of a new multiscale approach using nuclear magnetic resonance, small angle scattering, microscopy and computational modeling to study LLPS that can then be extended to other molecular systems. Additionally, the education plan aims to improve science literacy among high school students, broaden STEM representation from economically-disadvantaged and/or underrepresented populations, and develop science teaching and communication skills for STEM graduate students. To accomplish these goals, high school students will participate in a yearly mini-workshop as part of the Summer Science Institute (SSI) at Syracuse University. These students will experiment on how physical parameters (e.g. temperature) modulate LLPS of proteins, the results of which will be integrated into the project's scientific goals.<br/><br/>The research project is focused on elucidating the molecular determinants of the liquid-liquid phase separation of ubiquilin proteins, specifically UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4.

Normally, the genome is compacted by winding the DNA around barrel-like cores of proteins. Tight packaging turns genes off, but chemical modification of the protein cores can relax the DNA and allow genes to be turned on.  The modifications are carried out by a large group of enzymes, but how and where they function remains unknown. This project will take an interdisciplinary approach, including organic chemistry, protein engineering, and cell biology--to uncover the specificity of these modifiers and to design enzymes capable of turning on specific genes at will. The research setting will provide a unique training ground for graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, a chemical biology laboratory course will engage undergraduate students in inquiry-based exercises where students will learn to design and carry out real-world experiments aimed at developing their critical thinking and independent learning skills.  Early implementation of such a research-based course is expected to bridge a gap existing in the current educational curriculum by motivating STEM students in science education and research with the long-term benefit of generating a skilled workforce.<br/><br/>Changes in gene expression in eukaryotic organisms like humans can be achieved by reversible chemical modifications on the histone protein components of chromatin.  The focus of this project is to study a particular type of modification, called lysine methylation, which is removed by a class of enzymes known as lysine demethylases. How specific demethylases contribute to gene expression has remained largely unexplored, due in part to the lack of tools capable of rapidly interrogating a given demethylase in intact cells under carefully controlled conditions. Using one particular lysine demethylase as paradigm, this research will focus on developing a novel chemical-genetic platform that combines pharmacological and genetic engineering to perturb specific isoforms with rationally designed small molecules and precise temporal control. Furthermore, the engineered demethylation apparatus will be combined with the spatial selectivity of programmable CRISPR-Cas9 to develop a new type of conditional epigenome editing tool for regulating gene transcription in space and time. The approach will be applied to reprogram expression of genes that underlie faithful cell division, cellular differentiation, lineage commitment, and ultimately, organismal development.

The goal of this research is to understand how enzymes that methylate DNA locate the correct sites to modify. This is an important question, because accurate methylation deposition is critical for genome integrity and function, and alterations in methylation can result in abnormal developmental and pathological states, including cancers. The scientific outcome of this project could ultimately prove useful for developing novel technologies to correct methylation defects and thereby to improve agriculture and medicine. In addition, this project will provide many educational benefits, such as multi-disciplinary research training for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, including those from underrepresented groups. The project will also engage high school students in research, with the aim of providing an enriching experience, particularly for women, minorities, and those who would be the first in their families to attend college. Another impact of the project will be the development of three learning modules centered on various aspects of genetics: tabletop science station for K-12 students, field trip module for middle school students, and summer science-camp for rural Wisconsin high school students and science teachers.<br/><br/>DNA methylation is not only prevalent in plants, fungi, and some animals, but also plays critical roles in genome defense, differentiation, development, disease, and environmental responses in these organisms. Despite its importance, remarkably little is known about the actual cue and the molecular mechanism that establish cell type- and locus-specific DNA methylation. Understanding the diverse functions of DNA methylation requires mechanistic knowledge of how DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme at the heart of this modification, is targeted to specific genomic loci. This project focuses on understanding the molecular actions of several new chromatin factors in mediating the establishment and maintenance of genome-wide and locus-specific DNA methylation patterns, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a powerful model. The comprehensive genetic, biochemical, and genomic studies proposed in this project will generate significant mechanistic insights into the specificity of DNA methylation regulation at the whole genome levels as well as local DNA sequence levels. Deep mechanistic knowledge of DNA methylation is crucial to understanding the molecular processes that establish DNA methylation landscapes under physiological and pathological conditions. This research will also have substantial impacts on understanding how DNA methylation is coordinated with other critical developmental, physiological, and environmental processes to regulate genome function in other plant and animal species."

Cell shape is governed primarily by an internal scaffolding structure called the cytoskeleton. Unlike human-made scaffolding structures, the cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and is able to change its configuration in response to developmental and environmental signals, allowing cells to adapt to changing conditions. This project uses the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton of plants as a model to understand how microtubule polymers form highly ordered arrays in the absence of a centralized organizing mechanism. By integrating approaches scaling from single molecules to whole cells, this research will reveal principles by which biochemical activities at the molecular scale result in complex microtubule arrays at the cellular scale, principles expected to be applicable to other such arrays. Since the plant cortical microtubule array directs cell wall assembly, this work might also lead to new strategies to engineer plant biomass for improved food and cellulosic biofuel production. The work from this project will be integrated into education and outreach through inquiry-based activities at multiple levels across the K-20 education spectrum. Specifically, the PI will incorporate this work into a course for Architecture students to inspire new human-made structures based on cellular design principles and a new professional development workshop on Biological Self-Organization to provide high-school teachers with a mathematical biology resource to help them meet the Next Generation Science Standards. He will also integrate work from this project into a problem-based Teen Science Caf program, which attracts between 1,000-1,500 students from grades 6-12 annually and is a great opportunity to teach the scientific inquiry process and about dynamic cellular events.<br/><br/>The PI will study how noncentrosomal microtubules form highly ordered arrays without the benefit of an organizing center. This problem is fundamentally important because noncentrosomal microtubule arrays are vital for the structure and function of evolutionarily diverse organisms such as fission yeast, humans and plants. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, the PI will use the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton of Arabidopsis thaliana plants as an experimentally tractable model system. The PI hypothesizes that the net balance of multiple microtubule-associated proteins dynamically controls array structure by regulating the trajectory, length and dynamics of cortical microtubules. To test this hypothesis, a combination of live imaging, in vitro experiments at single molecule resolution and computational modeling will be used to: 1) determine the function of EB1 and associated proteins in regulating the behavior of cortical microtubules, 2) investigate the role of microtubule bundling in array organization, 3) determine how distinct molecular activities interact in space and time to dynamically pattern cortical microtubules, and 4) elucidate the mechanisms that define and change cortical microtubule array orientation in response to developmental and environmental signals. Together, this research will advance our understanding of how distinct cortical microtubule arrays are built to create different cell shapes and how arrays are remodeled in response to signals to modify plant growth. The work from this project will be integrated into multiple education and outreach activities to introduce new biological concepts and techniques into classrooms and to get students interested in pursuing a STEM career. The PI will incorporate this work into a course for Architecture students to inspire new architectural designs based on principles underlying cellular architecture. The PI will also lead a professional development workshop on Biological Self-Organization for high-school teachers, which will combine hands-on activities and computer modeling to provide a mathematical biology resource to take back to classroom.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle of the secretory pathway for the production of a wide variety of the cell's building blocks, as well as for the control of essential stress and hormonal signaling pathways. To achieve maximum efficiency, the ER assumes a unique architecture characterized by a network of interconnected membrane tubules and sheets to form closed polygons. Discoveries in ER integrity are emerging from studies in various model organisms/systems such as fruit flies, yeast and cultured human cells. Compared with these systems, however, the ER has acquired unique morphological and functional features in the plant lineage that are likely linked to its important role in lipid synthesis together with chloroplast, intercellular communication, protein storage and plant-specific hormone signaling.  The goal of this project is to investigate the unique regulatory mechanisms that maintain plant ER integrity by using genetic mutants, live cell imaging and biochemical approaches.   These approaches have identified several genes that encode critical players involved in ER integrity and architecture including an Arabidopsis ER-associated dynamin-like protein, named RHD3.  The project research aims to elucidate the mechanistic role of RHD3, as well as other gene products identified by mutant screens, in maintaining the architecture and functions of the plant ER.  Since integrity and function are two inextricably linked features of the ER, the research will advance the general understanding of ER roles in the plant secretory pathway in the context of a multicellular organism and contribute to answering fundamental questions regarding differences in ER organization and function across eukaryotic systems.  <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS<br/>Plants are the direct or indirect primary carbon and nitrogen source of all animals and humans, in addition to their role in providing materials and fuels. The secretory pathway of plants plays a fundamental role in the conversion of fixed carbon into energy-rich materials, such as proteins, lipids and complex sugars. These plant-derived products are not only important for nutrition, but have the potential to be used as renewable fuels, lubricants, textiles and building materials. Because unique variations exist among eukaryotes as a result of evolutionary adaptation, it is important to study the unique properties of the plant ER which is the key organelle for the biosynthesis of important building blocks of cells and for essential signaling path-ways in growth, development and stress responses.  The project will also broaden the impact of on the plant cell science research community by providing unique plant lines and constructs which will be made available to other plant cell biologists.  The research will promote teaching, research training and outreach activities through multiple avenues both at Michigan State University as well as the local community.  In particular, project personnel will continue to communicate to students and teachers discoveries in plant science and their impact on the society by engaging students and teachers in research activities in the lab and by performing science presentations at schools."

Bioavailable nitrogen derived from ammonia produced by the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen is second only to water as the limiting nutrient in plant growth. From the appearance of the enzyme nitrogenase approximately two billion years ago, until the wide-spread use of the Haber-Bosch process in the 1950's for the chemical production of ammonia fertilizers, all life obtained nitrogen  from biological nitrogen fixation using the nitrogenase enzyme. Currently, biological nitrogen fixation using nitrogenase supplies approximately one-half of the world's ammonia. The remaining half is produced by the Haber-Bosch industrial process, a process that is responsible for approximately 2% of the world's total energy consumption. The goal of this research is to reveal the mechanism of nitrogenase function.  Understanding of nitrogenase function will potentially enable the effective utilization of nitrogenase activity for greater human benefit, increasing food production and reducing energy consumption during the industrial production of ammonia fertilizers.  In addition, investigators are active in science education and training at all levels.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to further refine the nitrogenase reaction mechanism elucidated by the investigators through the use of genetic/biochemical approaches for the isolation of catalytic intermediates in combination with the laboratory's use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize the reaction intermediates.

Molecules (such as salts, ions, polar molecules) that are happy (energetically stable) in water are not always happy in a membrane-like environment.  Surprisingly, however, numerous water-loving molecules are found in the membrane or are known to cross the membrane environment quite easily. Cell penetrating peptides are observed to readily enter cells. Since water-loving molecules appear to reside within and transfer through the cell membrane, it is natural to think that water goes along for the ride. Water has an important role in these processes. Since it is impossible to see individual water molecules with laboratory experiments, computer programs will be used to perform what are known as molecular simulations. These computational methods, incorporating mathematical descriptions of the physics of how biological molecules interact with one another, follow the motions of individual molecules in time and space. This allows researchers to explore the role of water associated with cell membranes (bilayers) in the transfer of polar and charged molecules through this environment. The view is at the atomic and molecular level!  Novel methods will be used that have been developed to describe the varying molecular properties of water and permeating molecules as they move through sharply different environments. The research will address the interaction between water and lipids in the membrane. Specifically, does the water present in the local environment of the permeating molecule support structural changes of the membrane that stabilize the molecule in the ""oily"" lipid region? More broadly, understanding the role of water in differing environments has implications in numerous scientific and technological contexts (water-mediated self-assembly of nanoparticles, colloidal suspensions and their role in the environment, etc.), thus furthering our global understanding of this ubiquitous solvent and its behavior across different scientifically and technologically important chemical environments.  Application of these novel methods on new computer hardware such as Graphical Processing Units (GPU's) that are now becoming viable commodity high-performance computing alternatives for routine computing will be continued.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Motivated by the inescapable current and future requirement for cooperation between the quantitative and qualitative scientific disciplines to further our understanding of fundamental biophysical and biochemical processes, two educational/outreach goals will be established. 1). A multi-disciplinary team consisting of a university professor and two veteran teachers (of chemistry/physics and biology) will introduce students at Newark High School (NHS; which serves a substantial population of minority students and groups underrepresented in science, technology, and engineering) to an introductory computational chemistry course that will emphasize a philosophy of multi-disciplinary approaches, combining the skill sets, tools, and knowledge of the fields of chemistry, biology, physics, math, and computer science, to understanding fundamental biophysical phenomena. This will expose students to practical computer tools and skills widely used in academia and industry.  2). To support the mathematics preparedness of undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry students at the University of Delaware, and to spark greater student interest in the pursuit of research in such fields as biophysics, chemical physics, and computational sciences, an introductory computational chemistry course will be developed, using state-of-the-art computers and programs, focusing on mathematics of chemistry to solve problems of a chemical nature and to prepare students for the mathematical rigor of Physical Chemistry courses. Such extra preparation and opportunities for chemistry students to sharpen their basic math skills will make Physical Chemistry a less burdensome, more enriching (and perhaps fun) experience for students.  Project goals serve to increase students' quantitative reasoning skills at an early point in their careers, thus establishing a firm platform from which to pursue numerous avenues of research relevant to future societal needs."

These tubes are composed of cells that squeeze and relax to move contents through the tubes in the correct direction, at the correct rate, and in a coordinated manner. The squeezing is driven by a molecular machine called the acto-myosin cytoskeleton, which is comprised of tiny motors that pull on a girdle-like mesh of fibers to contract the cells. The ""girdle"" must be lined up properly and coordinated between cells for tubes to work properly. However, little is known about how this ""girdle"" knows how to squeeze the right amount at the right time or how its fiber alignment changes in response to changing mechanical conditions. To better understand how this process works, the Cram and Zaidel-Bar labs study the reproductive system of a small nematode worm called C. elegans. This worm can produce its body weight in babies every day, so many eggs have to be squeezed through the reproductive system in a coordinated and robust manner. This system was chosen because the worm is transparent, which makes it easy to see the response of the ""girdle"" in real time in a living animal, and the system uses the same cellular components as do other animals. This project will determine, molecularly, how the worm's acto-myosin ""girdle"" responds to the stretch of eggs entering and exiting the system, and how it contracts just the right amount to push the eggs through in the right direction and without mangling them. Because similar genes regulate acto-myosin contraction in many animals, the results should be broadly applicable up to and including primates. Broader impacts of this project include developing materials to help undergraduates learn how to be scientists, and involving high school teachers in research experiences and helping them design projects that they can take back to their classrooms.<br/><br/>Actin networks in contractile cells, such as the smooth muscle and endothelial cells of the vasculature, are critical for cell contractility, motility, and tissue function. But, how do cells organize their actin cytoskeletons in response to changing mechanical conditions? And how is cytoskeletal alignment coordinated between cells to produce a cohesive tissue-level response? To address these questions, the Cram and Zaidel-Bar labs have developed a new in vivo model system: the C. elegans spermatheca, a stretch-responsive and contractile tissue in the nematode reproductive system. The Cram lab has discovered that during the first ovulation, myosin becomes activated and pulls a network of loose actin fibers into aligned and oriented stress-fiber like acto-myosin bundles. In a screen through all actin binding proteins in C. elegans, the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins Merlin (NFM-1) and Ezrin (ERM-1) were identified as key tissue-level regulators of actin fiber orientation. ERM proteins can bind plasma membrane, actin, and transmembrane proteins, placing them ideally to regulate cell responses to stretch. Using live imaging, biochemical, genetic, and optogenetic approaches, this collaborative team will elucidate the role ERM proteins play in actin organization within and between cells of the spermatheca. Aim 1 will determine the dynamics of the ERM proteins during spermathecal stretch and contraction and discover the mechanism by which these proteins regulate the apical and basal actin networks and tissue-level organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Aim 2 will determine how ERM proteins both regulate and are regulated by the small GTPase Rho, including analysis of a novel regulator C45G9.7/Tip1, to promote cytoskeletal organization and orientation. This project will reveal that Merlin and Ezrin, important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, act not only within individual cells, but in tissue-level coordination of actin cytoskeletal alignment. Novel roles for ERM proteins in cell response to physiological levels of strain will be revealed, including, how the cytoskeleton adapts its orientation and alignment for optimal tissue contractility. The Broader Impacts of this project include 1) developing a structured mentoring approach for undergraduate research and 2) involving science teachers in independent research with the goal of enhancing K-12 STEM education.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ""flint"", hidden inside proteins, consists of small metal-containing or vitamin-like compounds called cofactors, which bind the O2 molecule and begin to break apart its chemical bonds. The partially dismantled oxygen molecule is then ready to combine with carbon-containing molecules from food, releasing vast amounts of energy. In this way, cofactors allow nature to harness and control the power of atmospheric O2. The main objective of this project is to investigate a surprising variation on this process. Recently discovered proteins catalyze reactions between carbon-containing molecules and O2 without the help of cofactors. This project examines how these proteins effectively generate ""fire without flint"" or energy without cofactors. This project also examines an important potential biotechnological application of these proteins. A cofactor-free, protein-based catalyst can be easily grown in bacterial cultures without the need for the expensive added ingredients or elaborate biochemical pathways needed for assembling cofactors into proteins. These biocatalysts moreover offer clean, byproduct-free alternatives to existing chemical methods for carrying out similar processes. This project specifically examines how cofactor-free proteins can efficiently convert the abundant, renewable plant polymer known as lignin into starting materials for the production of bioplastics. This project will train K through 8 teachers and help develop a course about teaching teachers on issues of sustainability and science education. Research training and education of graduate and undergraduate students will also be supported by this project.<br/><br/>O2 is an ideal oxidant because of its thermodynamic power, abundance, and the benign nature of its by-products. However, O2 possesses unpaired electron spins, making reactions between O2 and organic molecules impractically slow unless a catalyst is present. Biological catalysis of reactions with O2 generally depends on cofactors. The requirement for cofactors to mediate O2 biocatalysis is generally considered absolute. However, bacterial enzymes that catalyze diverse reactions between O2 and organic species in the complete absence of cofactors have recently been discovered. The main objective for this project, which focuses on a large family of cofactor-independent enzymes, is to determine how the protein environment alone activates O2 and steers the activated species toward the formation of specific products. This objective integrates experiment with several levels of theory.

All NSF proposals are evaluated not only on the Intellectual Merit of the proposed research, but also on the Broader Impacts of the proposed work, such as societal relevance, educational outreach, and community engagement. Many institutions have begun employing Broader Impacts support professionals, but in most cases, these individuals have not worked as a group to identify and share best practices. As a consequence, there has been much duplication of effort.  Through coordination, BIONIC is expected to improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and have significant impact in several areas: 1) Researchers will benefit from an increased understanding of the Broader Impacts merit review criterion and increased access to collaborators who can help them design, implement, and evaluate their Broader Impacts activities; 2) Institutions and research centers will increase their capacity to support Broader Impacts via mentoring for Broader Impacts professionals and consulting on how to build Broader Impacts support infrastructure, with attention to inclusion of non-research-intensive universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic- and Minority-Serving Institutions that may not have the resources to support an institutional Broader Impacts office; and 3) NSF, itself, will benefit from a systematic and consistent approach to Broader Impacts that will lead to better fulfillment of the Broader Impacts criterion by researchers, better evaluation of Broader Impacts activities by reviewers and program officers, and a system for evaluating the effectiveness of Broader Impacts activities in the aggregate, as mandated by Congress and the National Science Board. Through its many planned activities, BIONIC will ultimately help advance the societal aims that the Broader Impacts merit review criterion was meant to achieve. <br/><br/>The main goals of the project will be accomplished through the four specific objectives: 1) Identify and curate promising models, practices, and evaluation methods for the Broader Impacts community; 2) Expand engagement in, and support the development of, high-quality Broader Impacts activities by educating current and future faculty and researchers on effective practices; 3) Develop the human resources necessary for sustained growth and increased diversity of the Broader Impacts community; and 4) Promote cross-institutional collaboration and dissemination for Broader Impacts programs, practices, models, materials, and resources. BIONIC will facilitate collaborative Broader Impacts work across institutions, help leverage previously developed resources, support professional development, and train new colleagues to enter into the Broader Impacts field. This project will improve the quality and sustainability of Broader Impacts investments, as researchers continue to create unique and effective activities that are curated and broadly disseminated. BIONIC will create a network designed to assist NSF-funded researchers at their institutions in achieving the goals of the Broader Impacts Review Criterion. In so doing, BIONIC will promote Broader Impacts activities locally, nationally, and internationally and help to advance the Broader Impacts field.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Divisions of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences."

These membranes make possible a dynamic and important storehouse of cellular energy, which is a transmembrane proton gradient, i.e. a situation (by analogy to a battery) in which there are more protons on one side of an energized membrane and fewer on the other. Energy from food or light (in photosynthesis) can be used to make this proton battery, which efficiently fuels the cell.  This research program will study a class of proteins (Heme Copper Oxidases), which includes Cytochrome c oxidase that uses atmospheric oxygen as a fuel. The Heme Copper Oxidase proteins help build the gradient by a common and important mechanism in biology called proton pumping, which moves protons in one direction across a non-electrically conducting membrane, thereby constructing a transmembrane proton gradient.  The objective of this research is to better understand the design features of proton-pumping proteins, which will also help in the design of specialized semi-permeable membranes such as those needed for electrochemical cells (which include batteries).  The project brings together the study of the biology of the cell, of the chemistry of the reactions that fuel the proton pumping process and of the physics of the motion of the charged protons.  The work will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary science.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to carry out computer simulations starting with the known positions of the atoms in the Heme Copper Oxidase proteins. While there is no detailed model for proton pumping in any protein, there is a general outline that forms the basis of the research. The calculations will look for regions of the protein that can provide stopping points for the proton as it moves across the protein.  In addition, protons must move through the protein via pathways that can be made up of channels filled with water molecules.  These pathways will be identified and studied to see where blockages can be formed to keep the protons from moving backwards to dissipate the proton gradient.  The calculation methods used here are evolving state of the art techniques and they will be tested and improved by these calculations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Certain RNAs act by turning other genes on and off or by ensuring the faithful synthesis of proteins. Many RNA molecules fold into specific three-dimensional shapes that allow them to perform these different functions in the cell. The goal of this research project is to learn the physical rules that govern how RNA molecules fold into specific three-dimensional shapes. This is important for understanding how RNAs evolve over time and in different organisms. It is also important for learning how to engineer RNA for applications such as toxin sensing or biofuel production. Sensitive microscopes will be used to observe how single RNA molecules fold over time and show whether the structure of a particular RNA is flexible or rigid. New photo-reactive chemical groups will be synthesized and used to turn on the function of the RNA with light. The ability to control RNA with light will produce new research tools that can be used by other scientists. In addition, this research project will contribute to science education and increase STEM education among underrepresented groups by providing research experience to undergraduate students and by engaging undergraduate teams to develop simplified protocols for laboratory modules on RNA structure and evolution. This research project will contribute to US competitiveness and is expected to produce new chemical tools for controlling RNA with light that can be used by other scientists and biotechnology companies.<br/><br/>Non-coding RNAs self-assemble into complex structures to catalyze biochemical reactions, regulate gene activity by diverse mechanisms, and scaffold cellular compartments in the nucleus and cytoplasm. They are important drivers of molecular evolution and essential for the normal growth of all life forms. This research aims to identify fundamental principles of RNA self-assembly, using catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) as model systems. Previous studies of a bacterial group I ribozyme demonstrated that cooperative networks of tertiary interactions in different regions of the RNA drive assembly toward a unique native conformation. It is not known whether this is a general property of all naturally evolved RNAs, nor how tertiary interactions alter the conformational dynamics of RNA. Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) will be used to monitor millisecond to second motions of RNA helices under different conditions and distinguish native and non-native conformations. The folding dynamics of the stable Azoarcus ribozyme will be contrasted with that of Twister ribozyme, which requires less Mg(II) for self-cleavage than for folding. New photo-reactive nucleotides will be synthesized to control folding and self-cleavage of the small Twister ribozyme with light. New photocaged nucleotides will be synthesized and combined with smFRET to directly observe the dynamical motions in the RNA before and after RNA self-cleavage.

As biological understanding progresses, computational methods are becoming increasingly important for predicting the properties of cell membranes.  At the same time, the computational methods need to be checked and validated by means of experimental measurements that can serve as benchmarks for the calculations.  This project provides such an experimental framework to serve as a basis for advancing the predictive power of computational biophysics.  The overarching goal is to understand the operational diversity of membrane proteins for the performance and regulation of biological function. This project will sustain community outreach, dialogue, and early involvement of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. This proposal will also expose young people to science and recruit them to engage in research through the ""Science Caf"" program.  <br/><br/>This project addresses central issues in predictive membrane biophysics, including molecular orientation, dynamic properties and the ionization states of designated functional side chains of His, Lys, Glu, Asp and Arg in membrane proteins.  The key methods involve peptide synthesis, stable isotope labeling, circular dichroism spectroscopy, solid-state magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, and collaborations with computational biophysicists.  The experimental approaches employ a novel ""host"" peptide design, developed by the investigators, in which minimal numbers of interfacial aromatic amino-acid residues serve to position a tilted transmembrane helix near a ""tipping point"" in lipid bilayer membranes. Within this context, the systematic incorporation of specific ""guest"" residues provides important insights concerning ionization behavior and protein-lipid molecular interactions that are essential for the biological functions of many classes of membrane proteins.

A new experimental methodology will be implemented for atomic resolution characterization of the structures possessed by highly flexible proteins and the changes to those structures that often accompany binding to other macromolecules. As a result, this research and associated training activities will yield fundamental, molecular level insights into essential biological processes that will benefit the biotechnology industry. This program will train junior scientists to seek fundamental insight into the systems and processes from biochemistry, using the principles and quantitative laws from the physical sciences. During each year of the project, the PI will bring middle school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to Penn State University in order to illustrate for them the opportunities that arise from higher education in science and engineering fields. Additionally, the PI has been named a mentor for two Penn State programs that aim to bring under-represented minority undergraduate students into the research laboratory. Through these programs, the PI will bring a minimum of one enrolled student per year of the project into his laboratory. Trainees supported by this project will continue to provide the daily mentorship of all students engaging in these outreach programs, with guidance from the PI, who is firmly committed to expanding opportunities in science for students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to quantitatively describe intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) ensembles and structure-function relationships on the atomic and molecular scale. The challenge is to find a model that best describes the conformational features of highly flexible biomolecules, as this structural description is intimately connected with cellular function. From a broader point of view, the objective is to develop new models for protein conformation and dynamics that lead to the application of structural biological tools to IDPs, which are hypothesized to possess native structure that is directly responsible for imparting their specific functions. Defining structure-function relationships for IDPs requires broadening the traditionally narrow paradigm developed for cooperatively folding systems. This project continues efforts to develop quantitative and efficient tools for experimentally constraining IDP structure and site-specific interactions with other biomolecules through carbon-detected NMR spectroscopy. Traditionally acquired (i.e., 1H-detected) NMR spectra of IDPs suffer from poor chemical shift dispersion, rendering them unsuitable to high resolution applications in most cases. It has been shown that 13C-direct detection spectroscopy generally produces spectra suitable for quantitative analysis of IDPs. The development of carbon-detected NMR methods for the study of IDPs will continue to be developed during the course of this project. Recently a fully atomistic structural ensemble of the protein FCP1 in its unbound state has been resolved. This project will expand efforts to include structural characterization of the complex formed between FCP1 and its folded partner Rap74, while also defining the conformational ensemble of a segment from the RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain, which is the biological target of the FCP1 phosphatase activity. Finally, it is necessary to connect structural findings to functional outcomes. For the model systems investigated in this project, biological function can be assayed by defining binding interactions between the IDPs under study and their cooperatively folded partners. Functional hypothesis testing will be primarily carried out through quantitative calorimetric binding studies, establishing the energetic consequences of intrinsic disorder and defining the driving forces for disordered protein interactions."

This project will explore the molecular and cellular basis of post-cell division asymmetry in cell motility and define the functional role of asymmetric divisions in the control of cell migration during tissue growth. Not only will this research generate freely available novel computational methods and analysis tools suitable for a wide array of applications, the findings of this work will have wide-reaching implications for understanding the control of cell migration across a plethora of cellular systems and organisms. Through its broader impacts, the project will additionally expose undergraduate and high school students (with emphasis on recruiting underrepresented groups) to integrated cross-disciplinary computational / experimental scientific approaches and provide hands-on experience of international collaborative research techniques upon the creation of several new, targeted, interactive Global Interface Science (GIS) workshops.

These studies will probe ACD in motile cells, validate model predictions and altogether elucidate a previously unexplored role for mitosis in the control of migration. In particular, the interplay of ACD with cell signaling, geometry and mechanical motility cues across different scales, from the molecular to the cellular will be investigated through the following tasks: A) develop new modeling methodologies to investigate the role of localized intracellular dynamics in the establishment of asymmetric post-mitotic motility and functionally validate model predictions at sub-cellular resolution in vivo; B) Predict the effects of ACD-driven differences in cell architecture on motility dynamics in silico alongside quantification of dynamic alterations in cell architecture occurring during division in vivo; C) quantify pre- and post-mitotic fluctuations in cell tension at single-cell resolution in vivo and define the interplay of cell tension with the induction of ACD and differential motility in silico and in vivo. The products of this research will include novel computational ABM models and image analysis software, which will uniquely enable studies of key aspects of cell migration and will be made freely available to the wider scientific community.

Comparative analysis across all CMNR bacterial genomes will facilitate inference of the gene regulatory networks and also aid in elucidating the evolutionarily conserved and unique features of the networks. Further, genes and interactions within sub-networks that effect specific changes in cell envelope composition will be identified by correlating changes in modular architecture of the M. smegmatis model during growth transitions between varying substrates and environmental conditions.

This project addresses, through computational modeling at multiple scales within the cell, the behavior of microtubules and associated proteins which are components of the dynamic structure (the cytoskeleton) which controls cell shape and responds to external physical forces on the cell. This project will elucidate underlying principles that govern the behavior of cellular systems with crucial roles in transducing mechanical forces and that can be used to design bio-inspired materials with enhanced stability and fatigue behavior. The project will provide education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational biophysical chemistry and increase the participation of groups underrepresented in science through the outreach ""Girls in Science and Technology Program"" at local middle-schools and through research experience opportunities for freshmen students participating in the ""Women in Science and Engineering"" program at the University of Cincinnati. The results of the project will be disseminated to the general public by the investigator and students through publications, conference presentations, and visits to local schools. <br/><br/>The project will address the role of structural fatigue in microtubule disassembly. The computer simulations proposed here will reach the long time- and length-scales required to investigate the mechanical behavior of microtubules and will supply details about the changes that accompany the formation of defects in the lattice. Lattice defects are high-affinity binding sites for proteins involved in the disassembly of microtubules and modulate the macroscopic elastic behavior addressed experimentally in this project. The project will also determine the origin of molecular-level changes in microtubule filament disassembly induced by the mechanical action of microtubule-associated proteins. Multiscale modeling of filament and microtubule-associated protein complexes will be used in forced disassembly simulations to determine molecular-level information about the role of kinesins in inducing highly curved intermediates during microtubule depolymerization.

This ability is encoded within the cellular DNA genome, which is converted into RNA and protein molecules through the basic processes of gene expression. Among the many functions these RNAs and proteins perform is regulating their own expression. In fact RNAs are now known to regulate almost all aspects of gene expression, and play central roles in controlling some of life's most basic processes. A key question in biotechnology and synthetic biology is then: How can RNA molecules be designed to control the expression of target genes inside cells to facilitate applications ranging from using cells as chemical factories all the way to using them as environmental sensors? As with many biomolecules, RNA function is intimately related to its structure. In this work, the investigator builds off of his development of a new small synthetic RNA mechanism called Small Transcription Activating RNAs, or STARs. STARs are hypothesized to allow the construction of unique gene expression control techniques since they represent a brand new function for sRNAs. This project seeks to use STARs as a test-bed for uncovering the principles for engineering RNA molecules to precisely control gene expression inside cells. This work will help realize the potential of RNA as a powerful substrate for cellular engineering. It will also shed new light on our scientific understanding of the fundamental sequence/structure/function relationship that underlies RNA's central role in natural biological systems. The projected studies and research training activities are thus expected to have a broad impact on society, ranging from the science of cellular gene regulation and the engineering science of RNA gene regulation that can directly connect to a broad array of biotechnological applications. This project will also cultivate the next generation of highly trained graduate students and teachers of synthetic biology who will be introduced to the broad, interdisciplinary nature of biotechnology research. Moreover, this program will actively engage the broader community to help create an informed public that is equipped to make important decisions about the future of synthetic biology.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  The overall goal of this project is to build an integrated research and education program focused on uncovering quantitative design principles that link small RNA sequence, structure, and function, and to use these principles to design synthetic RNAs that can precisely regulate gene expression. The education plan focuses on integrating research into the training of the next generation of synthetic biology students and teachers, and informing and exciting the broader public about synthetic biology.<br/><br/>Trans-acting bacterial small RNAs (sRNA) exert regulation via direct RNA-RNA interactions with target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that cause structural changes in the target. These changes in turn regulate many aspects of gene expression including transcription, translation and mRNA degradation. The central hypotheses of this project are that: 1) quantitative sRNA structure/function design principles can be discovered and used to rationally optimize and expand the functionality of RNA regulators, and 2) circuit-level design rules can be discovered and used to engineer new synthetic RNA genetic modules that control the timing and pattern of gene expression. The central goal of this CAREER project is to use Small Transcription Activating RNAs (STARs) as a test-bed for uncovering the quantitative design principles of RNA regulators for synthetic biology. This will be pursued using a multi-faceted approach that includes using cutting-edge RNA structure measurement technologies to elucidate the molecular level design principles of STARs. Once molecular-level principles are learned, the project will focus on using these techniques to learn the design rules for integrating STARs into decision making regulatory networks. In addition, new experiments and computational tools that can quantitatively model the kinetics of gene expression mediated by STARs will be used to understand how different aspects of STAR function propagate through RNA networks. Successful completion of these studies will forward the broader goal of creating a quantitative discipline of biological design that can be used to program cellular systems to solve important problems in sustainable energy, and biomanufacturing.  In addition, the work may provide insight to mechanisms of native small RNA regulation of naturally occurring biological systems.<br/><br/>Educational activities include developing a long term plan for the continuation of the Cold Spring Harbor Synthetic Biology summer course as a training center for a broad range of students and teachers across the globe; developing quantitative curricular materials for training future generations of synthetic biologists; and performing hands-on activities aimed towards families with school-age children to excite and inform them about synthetic biology."

This project will combine computational modeling and experimental characterization to resolve the molecular structure of the ethylene-binding domain. Among the broader impacts is a benefit society based on the agricultural and industrial significance of ethylene, and lay the groundwork for the creation of ethylene nanosensors.

The role of ethylene as a signaling molecule has been studied most extensively in plants where it plays important roles throughout growth and development. Ethylene is perceived by membrane-bound receptors, with the ethylene-binding site found within the transmembrane (TM) domains of the receptors. A copper (Cu-I) cofactor is critical for ethylene binding and, based on genetic and biochemical analysis, involves a novel His-His-Cys-Cys binding site for its chelation. This work will integrate a set of experiments, built on a foundation of computational modeling, to solve the structure of the ethylene-binding domain. First, two independent and complimentary computational approaches will be used to model the structure of the ethylene-binding domain: a bottom-up approach using energy-driven sampling of the TM domain, constrained by known characteristics of the binding site; and a top-down approach based on multiple sequence alignments of eukaryotic and prokaryotic ethylene binding domains to predict likely contacting residue pairs. Second, critical features of the ethylene binding domain will be determined by (1) characterizing the ethylene-binding ability of receptor homologues across diverse species and (2) mutational analysis of ethylene receptor function based on predictions of the computational model. Third, based on the computational model, the ethylene-binding domain will be re-engineered as a water-soluble analog to aid in its structural analysis and the creation of ethylene nanosensors. The Broader Impact of the project involves a partnership with AVA Gallery and Art Center (http://www.avagallery.org/) to develop a two-week summer course (""RIPE!"") will be offered to 9-12 year olds each year.

Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) play a key role in protecting DNA from damage by binding ss DNA that forms during normal cellular processes. This project addresses the questions of how SSBs bind ss DNA tightly to protect it, but at the same time allow key enzymes to access the DNA to perform their necessary activities. A combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques will be used to investigate the interactions between SSB and three different enzymes that help replicate DNA or repair DNA damage. This project will also be used as a platform for teaching scientific concepts and techniques to students of all ages in order to foster their career development. Students ranging from high school to graduate school will be actively engaged in performing the experiments. More experienced students will be encouraged to mentor newer students, thus fostering their teaching and mentoring skills, as well as solidifying their own core knowledge. The students who work on the project will also develop YouTube video vignettes that use entertaining ways to explain the science behind the project to younger students to excite young students about science and to encourage more young people to explore STEM-related career opportunities. <br/><br/><br/>Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) bind single-stranded (ss) DNA intermediates of DNA metabolism to protect ssDNA from damage and to prevent the formation of potentially mutagenic DNA secondary structures. Another critical function of SSBs is to mediate genome maintenance pathways by physically and functionally interacting with many different enzymes. These basic functions of SSB are conserved in all domains of life, but they would seem to interfere with one another. This project uses an Escherichia coli model system to uncover general mechanisms by which SSB and enzymes cooperate to enhance the efficiency of enzyme-catalyzed reactions on DNA. Despite their critical importance, mechanisms by which SSB-enzyme interactions stimulate enzyme activity and allow enzymes to gain access to DNA are not fully defined. Moreover, few studies have measured both enzyme stimulation and DNA-SSB remodeling under the same kinetic conditions to determine how the two processes are linked. This research addresses these questions by: 1) defining mechanisms by which E. coli SSB stimulates enzyme activity, and 2) defining dynamic interactions between enzymes and DNA-SSB that give enzymes access to DNA substrates. Interactions of three model enzymes, a clamp loader, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA helicase, with SSB will be investigated. These enzymes were chosen because each acts on the same DNA substrate, and thus will encounter the same dynamic DNA-SSB structure. This will increase the impact of the findings by permitting identification of mechanisms that are common to all three enzymes, and those that may be specific for a given enzyme.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

So, this study will reveal new insights into regulatory pathways that are critical to animal development and gene regulation.

However, functions of most ncRNAs are a mystery. Preliminary studies for this project discovered a family of novel ncRNAs that bind Sm rings, relatives of ancient protein complexes found in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, Sm rings are core components of snRNA complexes that catalyze mRNA splicing. However, several studies suggest that Sm rings have a variety of other poorly understood functions. Collectively, these findings suggest that multiple Sm-bound ncRNAs control unknown RNA targets, thereby regulating a variety of processes. This project will explore this idea using the nematode C. elegans as a model system. Targeted gene disruption will be combined with unique high throughput RNA sequencing strategies and established assays to determine how Sm ncRNA mutations alter RNA profiles and other biological functions. Transgene manipulations will test emergent models for how Sm ncRNAs control RNA targets in vivo. This project will reveal functions of novel ncRNAs, which represent a new, poorly understood paradigm of genetic control. Results may transform ideas for the functions of Sm family rings and their ncRNA partners. In addition, this project will help develop new genome scale methods and bioinformatic tools that will have broad applicability to the many other families of ncRNAs emerging from genomes throughout phylogeny."

These biofilms can be beneficial, for example when making vinegar.  But biofilms can also cause great harm as they can be tough and extremely difficult to eradicate, causing for example substantial corrosion and clogging of water and sewage pipes and of the pipelines used to transport oil and gas, as well as crop damage and food spoilage; thus they have significant negative impacts on the economy. This project will address the biological processes that regulate and facilitate the establishment and spread of biofilms and thus will result in a greatly improved understanding of biofilm formation.  In particular, we aim to understand the role cell surface structures, termed pilins, and sugar-modifications of proteins play in biofilm formation.  We will use cutting edge mass spectrometric (MS) technology to characterize at the molecular level biofilm formation in an archaea model organism, Haloferax volcanii.  Our research will not only advance the scientific knowledge in this exciting and timely field of research, but will also provide post-doctoral associates, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with invaluable training opportunities to study microbiological systems with novel, state-of-the-art technologies. Furthermore, the Pohlschroder lab will take part in science education programs in hopes of stimulating an enthusiasm for science among young students, particularly those who attend the underserved schools of West Philadelphia. The PI will continue to develop microbiology experiments for use by schools having limited resources, and the lab will participate in in-class instruction as well as teacher-training workshops hosted by the University of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Recently, sensitive quantitative proteomics analyses have led to the identification of crucial components underpinning processes that are required for biofilm formation in bacteria and archaea. Thus far, however, few attempts to characterize differential protein expression patterns in planktonic cells, as compared to cells from various early stages of biofilm development, have been made. Moreover, given limited technological means, previous mass spectrometric (MS) studies of differential glycosylation during these transitions had not been performed, leaving the role played by this post-translational modification in biofilm formation poorly understood. However, recent technological advances in MS now allow generation of the most complete prokaryotic glycoproteome available, in both planktonic cells and biofilms, clarifying the mechanisms involved at various stages of biofilm formation. Using genetic and biochemical approaches in concert with quantitative glycoproteomics, the lab will focus on determining how differential expression and post-translational modifications of type IV pilins, which are subunits of the evolutionarily conserved cell surface structures, type IV pili, affect biofilm formation. These methods will likely also lead to the identification and characterization of other proteins that play roles in biofilm development. Because archaea and bacteria share many features in common, these studies will not only promote a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying archaeal biofilm formation but will also provide insights for those studying bacterial biofilms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One method of communication involves the direct flow of information through membrane channels that are clustered on the surface of adjacent cells. These clusters of channels are called gap junction plaques and they are composed of proteins called connexin. The removal of gap junction plaques, from the cell surface, is critical to maintaining cell-to-cell communication and impacts numerous cellular functions, including proliferation, cell migration and differentiation. This project will elucidate the needed steps in gap junction plaque removal and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Increased information on annular gap junction processing and degradation could facilitate the development of new techniques to influence and control cell behavior, including proliferation and hormonal response. The PI will also continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. She used past NSF research funding to train forty-five undergraduates, eight graduate students, three postdoctoral fellows, seven visiting professors from minority institutions, five high school students, and ten medical students. Most of the students participating in this research over the years have been African-Americans, a severely under-represented group in science. She will also continue her broader outreach through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops for the scientific community and a unique outreach to the general public through art displays and lectures at a local art museum.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the mechanisms regulating annular gap junction processing. The PI hypothesizes that protein kinases via phosphorylation of sites on the C-terminal tail of the gap junction channel protein, connexin 43 (Cx43), play a pivotal role in annular gap junction vesicle processing needed for degradation. Such processing involves annular gap junction fissions as well as the formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes. Adrenal cortical cell populations will be used to elucidate the role of kinase-mediated Cx43 phosphorylation in annular gap junction processing and degradation. The approach will be to manipulate three kinases [protein kinase C (PKC), Src, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)] known to phosphorylate Cx43 and thought to be involved in annular gap junction degradation. In Objective I, To Measure the Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cell Populations in Which PKA, PKC, and Src Activities Have Been Altered. Three complementary methodologies will be used to selectively decrease or increase protein kinase activity: 1) chemical treatments with a panel of agents; 2) knockdown (siRNA) protocols; and 3) infection with replication-defective adenovirus vectors which result in constitutively activated kinases. In Objective II To Measure Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cells in Which the Cx43 Phosphorylation Sites Have Been Altered. Connexin mutation and truncation techniques will be used to modify the region of the intracellular ""tail"" of the Cx43 protein thought to be critical for kinase binding and/or phosphorylation. Throughout this study, annular gap junction processing (fission, formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes and fusion with other organelles (lysosomes, endosomes and plasma membranes [possible recycling of Cx43 to the plasma membrane]) will be investigated with immunocytochemical, quantum dot immuno-electron microscopy, western blot, and time lapse image analysis. Phospho-specific antibodies against the targeted sites are available and will be used to image the spacial and temporal distribution as well as protein amounts of the differing Cx43phosphoforms.The laboratory will continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. Students will be given a specific project and they will be encouraged to write and present their findings, both to the scientific community and to the general public. The PI will continue to make an impact on the scientific community through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops presented both nationally and internationally.  In addition, lectures and installation art displays created, by the PI and displayed at a local art museum, will enable the PI to teach the general public about dynamic cellular events.  It is hoped that information gained from this study and the training provided will serve to advance science and thus contribute to public welfare."

Protein folding is a difficult process and is potentially dangerous when it goes wrong. Correct folding and misfolding are key to the function of all cells and to maintain health. Yet there is still no general agreement about how this basic process works: do proteins fold through discrete well defined intermediates in discrete pathways, as in the classical view, or do they fold by way of multiple independent unrelated pathways as in the so-called new view. This work uses a powerful new approach developed in the last award to understand the protein folding problem, and is likely to provide the insightful information to define the folding process in some detail and answer key questions in the field. These studies will engage and actively train, teach, and support postdoctoral, undergraduate, and high school students in active hands-on research at the forefront of modern structural biology. <br/><br/>Naturally occurring protein hydrogen exchange (HX) behavior is very sensitive to the biophysical properties that allow protein molecules to accomplish their myriad biological functions. It has therefore been able to contribute importantly to protein science research, especially when measured by NMR at amino acid resolution. However NMR is limited to the study of relatively small proteins in quantity at high concentrations. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has developed an advanced mass spectrometry analysis (HX MS) that can measure HX at near amino acid resolution in large and complex protein systems in previously unreachable situations using minuscule amounts of biological material. This technique will be used to study the protein folding problem, which lies at the base of many important problems in biological science. The detailed mechanism of protein folding itself is not understood, mainly because transient folding intermediates and folding pathways are beyond the reach of the usual high resolution structural methods. The newly advanced HX MS technology is able to track the kinetic folding process and describe the intermediate forms and pathways that carry an initially unfolded protein to its final native state. In the proposed work, HX MS technology will be used to ask how proteins fold, why they fold in that way, and how helper chaperone molecules function to promote folding. The how question will be addressed in studies of a biologically typical large protein, unlike almost all previous studies (both theoretical and experimental) which have been directed at small proteins that account for only a few percent of the biological proteome. The why question will be addressed by studying at high structural resolution the folding of laboratory-designed proteins that have not been shaped and selected through biological evolution. Chaperone function will be addressed by studying the detailed folding of a protein while it is contained within the active GroEL chaperonin cavity. This work may well change the current protein folding paradigm and, more broadly, will provide a powerful new tool for protein structure-function studies that have simply not been possible before.

In this project, a Copper ion based spin probe will be developed for the ESR measurements.  The copper spin probe can be assembled without modification of the protein, and is much smaller that conventional probes and thus will enable more precise distance measurements. This project will measure changes in protein structure directly in cells under conditions where functional measurements can be performed. While training a number of graduate and undergraduate students, this project will expand access to pulsed ESR instrumentation to undergraduates and graduate students at regional colleges in Pennsylvania including those serving predominantly African American populations. This project will also provide hands on science experience, career awareness and academic advising to assist pre-college historically under-represented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project will develop strategies to exploit native protein residues to site-specifically and selectively attach Copper(II) for pulsed ESR distance measurements both in-vitro and in cells; and probe initial steps in the gating mechanism of ELIC, a prokaryotic, pentameric, ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi in lipid vesicles and in cells. A Copper(II)-based spin probe that can be assembled in situ from natural amino acid residues and a metal salt, without the need for post-expression synthetic modification, will be developed and used.

A key obstacle for this field is the concern about escape of an engineered organism into the environment.  To address this and other concerns, this research consortium that engages  researchers in the US, UK, France and Spain will engineer an independently replicating element (called an episome, which is not integrated into the DNA of the host cell) that consists of non-natural nucleic acids. These episomes will have genetic material based on TNA (threose-based nucleic acid) along with a system that replicates and expresses proteins from the episome. An autonomous TNA-based episome could not be propagated in nature (outside the laboratory)  because TNA precursors do not occur naturally.  The consortium of investigators each will develop specific components to be incorporated into the TNA episome, which will be transferred into a bacterial host. The research project, while high risk, is anticipated to generate high impacts in terms of providing enabling technologies to advance a synthetic biology-inspired bioeconomy. It will also generate insights into the evolution of genetic material. The training potential of this project is exceptional in that the students and junior researchers will gain valuable transdisciplinary and international training.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to re-structure the central dogma of molecular biology by developing an all-TNA episome based on bacteriophage Phi29 that can replicate in vitro and eventually inside living cells using an orthogonal cellular machinery engineered for this purpose. The engineered system will store protein-coding information in TNA polymers that will replicate independently of the cellular genome. The TNA coding information will be transcribed by an evolved RNA polymerase that can recognize the TNA template and produce natural messenger RNAs for translation into functional proteins.<br/><br/>This project is funded through a transnational funding mechanism between the United States National Science Foundation and European Funding Agencies that are part of the European Commission endorsed Research Area Network in Synthetic Biology.

Although currently used by plant and animal cells as important signaling molecules, these activated forms of oxygen could be highly toxic to cells and tissues and cause oxidative injury (oxidative stress). The long-term goal of this project, led by Ron Mittler and Rajeev Azad of the University of North Texas and Rachel Nechushtai of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, is to determine how cells monitor their intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and prevent its toxicity. In particular, the project will highlight an unknown aspect of the regulation of reactive oxygen in plant and animal cells, namely the use of iron-sulfur clusters by a newly discovered group of proteins to monitor reactive oxygen levels and regulate cellular metabolism and other vital processes. Results obtained from this study could lead to the development of new and novel approaches to enhance the tolerance of crops to important stresses such as drought and heat or delay senescence. In addition, the proposed study could identify novel plant-based compounds and proteins that mitigate oxidative stress, aging and different diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The PIs will train a number of graduate and undergraduate students and partner with a local education center and museum to provide outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>The PIs will investigate the role of a novel class of Fe-S proteins, NEET proteins, in maintaining ROS homeostasis in plant and animal cells. In light of their unique cluster features, it is hypothesized that NEET proteins use their redox-active labile clusters to sense ROS levels in cells and regulate different pathways that alter cellular metabolism. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1. Perform a comparative signaling and regulatory network analysis of plant and animal cells with altered level and/or function of NEET proteins. 2. Identify the NEET interactome network of plant and animal cells. 3. Determine the dynamics of NEET protein localization/ function in cells and conduct genetic complementation studies of NEET proteins between mammalian and plant cells. Using a combination of functional genetics, proteomics, advanced imaging, RNA-Seq and network analysis approaches, a mechanistic understanding of ROS/redox sensing/regulation in cells will be pursued. The mechanisms identified through this proposed NSF-BSF collaboration will be further compared between different kingdoms: plant - studied through the NSF part, and animal - studied through the BSF part of this project, to obtain an evolutionary perspective of ROS/redox sensing/regulation in cells.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation."

Telomerase is an enzyme that is responsible for making telomeres, structures that protect the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes, reminiscent of the hard ends of shoelaces. The genetic mechanism of telomere replication by telomerase is better studied in yeast and mammalian cells; far from each other as those two organisms are, they in fact represent relatively recent branches of eukaryotic phylogeny. In contrast, we study an ancient, deep branching lineage of eukaryotes, kinetoplastid protists. Our organism of choice, Trypanosoma brucei, has telomerase with unique structural and functional properties, and we will learn how this enzyme works. The project will encourage full participation from women and underrepresented minorities in science. Apart from training graduate and postdoctoral trainees, this project will also implement a three-year undergraduate program (BIOKEYS) in both PIs? laboratories; the major goal of this program will be to teach undergraduate researchers to value interdisciplinary sciences early in their research careers. In addition to gaining experience from designing experiments and problem solving using high-end technologies, students will be teaching and learning from each other as part of a research group.<br/><br/>Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, provides the major means for elongation of chromosome ends (telomeres), thus counteracting the loss of linear DNA ends in each cell cycle due to incomplete DNA replication by conventional DNA polymerases. Telomerase has two core components, the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) that catalyzes telomere elongation, and the telomerase RNA (TER), which provides a template for telomere DNA synthesis. The mechanisms of telomere elongation by telomerase are poorly understood in Trypanosoma brucei, a deep branching Kinetoplastid. Therefore, this project dissects structural, biochemical and genetic features of telomerase RNA in T. brucei to understand the mechanism of telomerase regulation in early eukaryotic species. The recent discovery of the T. brucei TER reveals novel features exclusive to deep branching eukaryotes, suggesting mechanistic differences in the process of telomere synthesis between T. brucei and higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, this project: (i) investigates telomerase RNA structure at a single nucleotide resolution using NMR and SHAPE chemistry, (ii) defines key TERT contact sites on TER that are essential for telomerase function in T. brucei using HITS-CLIP technology, and (iii) establishes the functional significance of TR domains by genetic manipulations and telomerase functional assays. Overall, this research will allow significant advances in understanding the mechanistic details of telomerase evolution in protists."

The first step of gene expression, called transcription, is mediated by a molecular machine called RNA polymerase (RNAP) and is guided by a plethora of proteins collectively named transcription factors. While the study of the bacterial RNAPs continues to provide a framework for understanding transcription in all domains of life, an in depth understanding of RNAP and transcription factor interactions is lacking. In this research, undergraduate student-scientists will use classical and innovative molecular biology techniques to discover and characterize how transcription factors influence RNAP activity in the bacterium E. coli.

Student-scientists will be mentored in all aspects of the research process. In addition, the investigators will develop a CURE (Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience) based on transcription factor-RNAP interactions to teach fifty undergraduates during the funding period, and many more afterwards, about the fundamental topic of protein-protein interactions. The project will also develop a research module for inclusion in a well-established science education outreach program for high school girls that will contribute to their preparedness for future STEM career paths and leadership roles in the sciences. <br/><br/>For the great majority of the 250 transcription factors in E. coli, it remains to be discovered how they influence gene expression and if they make a direct protein-protein contact with RNAP or its seven sigma factors. In this project, the investigators will discover and characterize transcription factor-RNAP domain interactions and transcription factor-sigma domain interactions. Guided by the availability of RNAP crystal structures the investigators have inputted 47 structured domains from RNAP and its sigma factors into a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) assay. Over 100 previously-identified candidate RNAP-associated proteins will be tested individually for interaction against each RNAP and sigma factor domain. Further, the RNAP and sigma factor domains will be screened against an E. coli proteome library using a B2H assay strain that is optimized for a fluorescence-activated cell sorting protocol enabling the isolation of cells containing productive protein-protein interactions. The investigators will use next generation sequencing to identify the DNA corresponding to the interacting protein-protein pairs. Following the creation of a landscape map of RNAP- and sigma factor-associated proteins, they will characterize exemplary interactions by identifying amino acid substitution(s) in both the transcription factor and the RNAP domain that disrupt the interaction. These genetic tools will be used to learn more about RNAP function by investigating the effect of the transcription factor-RNAP domain interaction on known phenotypes for the transcription factor in vivo, as well as on the initiation, elongation and termination properties of RNAP during transcription in vitro."

Finally, the project will support a student-run organization that pairs college students with girls from underserved public high schools for weekly mentoring sessions that include assistance with math and science skills.<br/><br/>This project focuses specifically on so-called ""de novo"" genes that have recently evolved from non-coding DNA sequence. Previous research from a variety of taxa has focused on identifying these genes and studying their emergence within populations, but little is known about their specific molecular and cellular functions. Working in the safe and genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster model system, this project will begin by using RNA interference to screen all de novo genes expressed in the testes for effects on male fertility. Genes whose expression is required for full fertility will become targets for functional characterization, which will be facilitated by the development of tagged transgenes, antibodies, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout mutant lines. These tools will be used in cytological experiments to investigate how each gene influences the process of spermatogenesis and/or the function of mature sperm after they are transferred to females. In parallel with these functional genetic analyses, the evolutionary history of each gene will be examined across related Drosophila species in order to understand how the gene arose from non-coding DNA sequence and how the protein it encodes has evolved since its emergence. For de novo genes that show signatures of rapid divergence between species, further genetic experiments will be conducted to determine the functional consequences of divergence. Taken together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive view of how the process of new gene creation can modify reproductive phenotypes."

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA on the DNA template, is the first step in gene expression that largely defines which genes will be active. The key unanswered question is how transcription is regulated across the genome to generate stable, cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression. By combining classic biochemical approaches with global sequencing, this project will determine how specific transcription patterns may be stabilized by universal mechanisms targeting the enzymes responsible for RNA synthesis. By studying the process of transcription, the project will tackle a general problem of how multiple layers of information could be packed into, and extracted from, the same DNA sequence.<br/><br/>This project deals with the phenomenon of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, which occurs within the first 100 nucleotides of many metazoan genes and is controlled by factors involved in most if not all Pol II-transcribed promoters. Pausing is established by the Negative ELongation Factor (NELF) and, apart from the well-known productive elongation, can be alternatively released without mRNA synthesis via premature termination. This project will investigate the roles of factors responsible for pause establishment and release in human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing adipocyte differentiation. Objective 1 will focus on establishing pausing to determine how NELF defines genes to be paused. The question will be addressed by perturbing the levels of NELF at various time scales and monitoring Pol II pausing distribution and dynamics using our published as well as new methods including 5'-capped RNA- sequencing and multiplex permanganate footprinting. Objective 2 will focus on pause release to determine how the decision between mRNA production versus termination regulates expression of genes in response to a model heat shock stimulus. The question will be addressed by combining Pol II ChIP-sequencing and global run-on assays with novel analysis of termination-specific small RNAs derived from paused complexes. By exploring Pol II pausing as a prominent yet still poorly understood phenomenon, a new principle organizing genes into networks may be uncovered. Students engaged into ongoing research will make more informed decisions on whether or not to pursue careers in science, which will elevate the reputation of basic science among general public especially in rural communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, microbes can be used to treat wastewater and improve agricultural soil productivity. Understanding how microbes organize and persist in different environments is important for promoting beneficial outcomes, as well as mitigating harmful effects.  This project will focus on an amazing ability microbes have for surviving in changing environments--through a process called  phenotypic diversity--which enables them to produce progeny with a wide range of behaviors or characteristics.  Predicting phenotypic diversity behaviors in microbes is a major unsolved problem.  This project will use the environmental bacterium and human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, to investigate the mechanisms used by bacteria to generate phenotypic diversity.  The fundamental principles learned from this project will be directly relevant to other microorganisms, thus, facilitating the management and engineering of microbes for beneficial outcomes. In addition, this project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. New knowledge will be shared with a broad audience through collaborations with secondary science educators and Impression 5, a science museum in Lansing, MI.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the role of the second messenger bis-(3-5)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) in controlling phenotypic diversity in clonal populations of Vibrio cholerae. c-di-GMP integrates environmental signals through a sophisticated signaling network to control, among other factors, the transition between motile and biofilm lifestyles. The hypothesis is that c-di-GMP signaling changes the sensitivity of transcriptional regulation to stochastic fluctuations inherent to molecular processes to control the proportions of different phenotypes. This project will use a combination of mathematical modeling, quantitative microscopy, and behavioral tracking to quantify the regulation of phenotypic diversity under different experimental conditions. Cell tracking and epifluorescence microscopy will be used to correlate signaling activity with behavior directly in single cells. The transition rates between motile and biofilm-forming phenotypes in growing cells will be quantified using time-lapse experiments. Finally, a genetic approach will be used to manipulate c-di-GMP levels and transcription regulation to test specific predictions from theoretical models. Overall, this project will elucidate design principles that allow signaling networks to integrate stochastic fluctuations with environmental signals to generate and control advantageous phenotypic diversity in clonal populations."

Defining the biochemical function of the products of these genes, termed functional genomics, is an important endeavor. Only after the functions of the many unknown genes are identified can the true metabolic diversity present in our planet's organisms be assessed. This work is concerned with discovering the genes involved with biosynthetic reactions in organisms that produce methane.  It will establish the biochemical function of the proteins that operate in pathways involved in coenzyme biosynthesis in methane producing microorganisms.  The applications of this knowledge can range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to efficiently producing methane as a source of energy from anthropogenic waste.  Worldwide, methanogenic microorganisms produce more than 400 million tons of the greenhouse gas methane each year as part of the global carbon cycle. Another reason to study the metabolism of these organisms is the desire to uncover the nature of the chemical reactions that were occurring in the oceans after the early earth's surface cooled enough to have hot liquid oceans where life could evolve. These reactions are described as 'protobiochemistry.' Protobiochemistry can be revealed as ""metabolic fossils"" or remnants of primitive metabolism that may still be functioning in present day methane producing organisms. <br/><br/>Science itself is the most effective tool for motivating students to become the next generation of young scientists.  Through the research described above, students will be exposed to many different scientific disciplines and methods, including but not limited to enzymology, molecular biology, organic synthesis, different forms of spectroscopy, bioinformatics, protein chemistry, analytical biochemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and anaerobic microbiology, all in one setting. Undergraduate students will participate in this work through undergraduate research in the lab. Over the last 10 years, 1-2 undergraduate students have worked on a continual basis in the White laboratory.  Students are expected to publish one original reviewed scientific work during their lab time, further preparing them for a future career in the sciences. The discovery of new biochemical pathways and the associated genes and enzymes has a far-reaching impact both within the scientific community and also to society at large.  The work outlined here will not only further our understanding of coenzyme biosynthesis and methane producing organisms, but may also provide a glimpse into some of the chemistry used by the earliest forms of life.  In this post-genomics era every newly characterized enzyme aids in the annotation of many genomes and provides insight into the metabolic potential of diverse organisms, both benign and pathogenic.  Every gene identified as to function also adds to the toolbox for metabolic engineering."

Microbiologists have identified the diversity of parts (microbial species) within many microbiomes, but they have a very limited understanding of how these parts fit together and how they change over time. Without a set of general assembly instructions for microbiomes, it is difficult to predictably manipulate these systems. This research will use microbes isolated from three fermented foods - fermented tea, sourdough, and cheese - to identify how communities of microbes evolve and the implications of this evolution for manipulating and designing microbial ecosystems. These food microbiomes are relatively simple systems (~2-10 species per microbiome) that have been cultivated for many years in different environments around the world. By identifying how evolution impacts the assembly of these model systems, this research will begin to provide microbiome assembly instructions that can be used in medicine, agriculture, and industry. The popularity of these model systems will be leveraged to improve public understanding of science and increase participation in microbiome research. Through the development of the Citizen Synthetic Ecology Network (CSEN), hundreds of volunteers will submit fermented food microbiomes that will be used in the proposed research. An Evolution in Your Kitchen education module will allow high school students to evolve fermented food microbiomes. The PI's online microbial outreach platform, MicrobialFoods.org, will disseminate infographics on basic concepts in microbiome science, synthetic ecology, and systems biology. <br/><br/>High-throughput sequencing surveys have rapidly unveiled patterns of microbial diversity, but the mechanisms that control the assembly of microbiomes have not been identified. Using a synthetic ecology framework, this project will determine the causes and consequences of the evolution of core microbiome components for the assembly of synthetic communities. The research will determine how core microbiome species have diversified functions across microbial communities and how this functional divergence leads to variable microbial interaction networks and microbiome assembly processes. The genomic and functional diversity of core microbiome species from globally distributed fermented food microbiomes will be characterized through genome sequencing and in vitro community assays. Experimental evolution will be used to determine the mechanisms that drive diversification of core microbiome components. Impacts of the diversification will be measured by assessing interchangeability, invasibility, and stability of synthetic communities."

This phenomenon is referred to as 'culture heterogeneity'. The goals of the project are to examine how much variation in stress response and survival exists in a culture of yeast cells, and to then understand the regulatory mechanisms that give rise to that variation. Using yeast as a model for free-living microbes, the project will use single-cell microscopy to study individual cells. Understanding both the sources and patterns of cell-to-cell variation in stress responses and survival will help society to understand how to control microbial cultures, which has benefits to human health, agriculture, and environmental remediation. In addition to this research, the project will develop an outreach program called 'Ask a Scientist', which aims to link K-6 elementary classrooms in the Madison, WI area with professional and student scientists who will serve as a science pen-pal for the class. The goal of the project is to provide teachers with a mechanism to increase young students' exposure to science and professional scientists. <br/><br/>This project will combine past advances in network inference with single-cell investigations to understand the dynamics and heterogeneity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress response. Past work inferred a systems-level signaling network that controls the yeast transcriptomic response to salt stress. The network has proven powerful, but does not capture signaling dynamics or cell-to-cell signaling variation, both of which are important in microbial stress defense. This project will test network predictions through single-cell analyses designed to capture signaling dynamics and culture heterogeneity by: 1) performing single-cell microscopy in living cells before and after salt treatment to determine the localization dynamics of pairs of fluorescently tagged regulators of the yeast stress response to characterize the correlations in regulator localization patterns, and 2) follow dynamic changes in representative transcripts in single living cells that express a fluorescently tagged version of the responsible transcription factor. Results will relate the dynamics of transcription-factor localization to dynamics of target mRNAs and to the dynamics of cellular stress tolerance in single cells. Together, results of this research will increase understanding of the mode and mechanism of culture heterogeneity, which will in turn illuminate sources of variation in the upstream cellular signaling network."

Thus, a proteome can be viewed as the complete set of molecular machines necessary to sustain a living organism.  Because many different biochemical functions are required in any particular cell, the proteome of any single organism must include a wide range of proteins with diverse amino acid sequences, three-dimensional structures, and biochemical activities. Nonetheless, the full collection of all proteins in all proteomes that ever existed on earth constitutes a minuscule fraction of the sequences that are theoretically possible. Thus, despite billions of years of evolutionary sampling, the vast majority of sequence space remains unexplored. However, recent advances in synthetic biology, combinatorial methods, and protein design have made it possible to begin exploring sequences that have never been exposed to evolution.   The proposed research aims to design and produce large collections of novel proteins that fold into well-defined 3D structures, and function in biologically relevant reactions.  Completion of this work will represent a significant advance toward developing artificial proteomes that were not evolved by nature, but nonetheless support the growth of living organisms. The project will have broader significance in basic science and for applied technologies:  Richard Feynman said, ""What I cannot create, I do not understand.""  Thus, the creation of novel proteins will both test our knowledge, and enhance our understanding of protein biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular evolution.  Design and construction of artificial proteomes will also impact applied science and biotechnology: Current biotechnology relies on protein sequences borrowed from nature, while future applications will benefit from de novo sequences that were not selected by nature, but are well-suited for industrial applications. This project provides excellent interdisciplinary research training opportunities.  The investigator will present this work also to the public and discuss it in the classroom.<br/><br/>Previous studies of proteins and proteomes were limited to sequences isolated (or modified) from natural systems.  The proposed research will overcome this limitation by making available libraries of millions of novel proteins. Such collections will be 1000-fold larger than typical bacterial proteomes.  In contrast to studies of natural proteomes, which reveal what was selected by nature, newly enabled studies of artificial proteomes will broaden our understanding beyond what evolved in nature, and will enable experiments that probe sequences, structures, and functions, which are not observed in natural biological systems, but nonetheless can occur in the realm of novel or synthetic biologies. The research will harness both combinatorial/ experimental and computational/theoretical approaches to pursue the following aims:<br/>-Design and construction of large collections of novel alpha-helical proteins.<br/>-Design and construction of large collections of novel beta-sheet proteins. Proteomes, whether natural or artificial, must contain both alpha and beta structures. <br/>-Development and implementation of a high throughput screen for folded structures. The quality of protein libraries will be enhanced by subjecting collections of computationally designed proteins to follow-up screens for structures that are soluble and stably folded.<br/>-Determination of 3-dimensional structures and stabilities of proteins from the novel proteome.  Successful designs will produce sequences that fold into expected structures.<br/>-Isolation and evolution of novel proteins that are active in vitro and functional in vivo.  Most importantly, collections of novel sequences will resemble proteomes if and only if they include proteins that are biochemically active and provide essential cellular functions."

By integrating diverse approaches this research will decipher and quantify the connections between the underlying structural and biochemical properties of individual &#945;&#946;-tubulin proteins and the complex polymerization dynamics that emerges from their collective interactions. In addition to advancing the understanding of a process of fundamental importance to cell biology, the project emphasizes educational impact. Graduate students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training. An outreach partnership with a local elementary school will expose underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students to the fun of doing science while providing them and their teachers with access to high-tech but relatively inexpensive digital microscopes to facilitate inquiry-based learning and discovery. These outreach activities will also provide new opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other members of the UT Southwestern community to become involved in science education.<br/><br/>The specific problem to be studied is microtubule catastrophe, the sporadic switch from microtubule growing to microtubule shrinking. The goal is to provide a convincing and testable molecular explanation for experimental measurements of catastrophe, specifically how frequently catastrophe occurs as a function of the concentration of the polymerizing &#945;&#946;-tubulin subunits. The research will combine a variety of approaches including predictive computational simulations, use of mechanism-specific site-directed mutants of &#945;&#946;-tubulin, and in vitro biochemistry and reconstitution. Using this set of tools, we will (i) incorporate three different biochemical mechanisms into a computational model for microtubule dynamics and determine how each mechanism affects prediction of catastrophe; (ii) perform experimental tests for neighbor coupling in the microtubule lattice, something that has been hypothesized to occur but that has not been previously testable; and (iii) measure how mutations to an interacting triad of residues that is conserved in &#945;- and &#946;-tubulin affect microtubule polymerization dynamics and the conformation(s) of &#945;&#946;-tubulin inside and outside the microtubule.

Copper ions, which are present in immune cells, can damage the cell membranes of bacteria by oxidizing their phospholipids. Interestingly, some host-defense peptides contain a copper-binding motif that enables them to bind copper and become metallopeptides. In this project, the PIs will develop new bio-physical and biochemical tools to investigate how host defense metallopeptides and copper ions may synergize their antimicrobial effects. This project has the potential to produce new principles that could be useful to design novel antimicrobial biomaterials. In addition, the project will include activities that engage college and pre-college students from diverse backgrounds in hands-on science and enhance their analytical skills. The PIs will leverage the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of their research, and passion for scientific research to spike scientific interest in young students and prepare high school students for a successful transition to college.  <br/><br/>The major goal of this research is a rigorous investigation of the interplay between host defense mechanisms at biological membranes. The molecular systems of interest are membrane-interacting host defense metallopeptides and other agents of the immune response that have the potential to unify their antimicrobial effects at lipid membranes. While host defense peptides have been studied for their ability to disrupt the conformational arrangement in bacterial cell membranes, the possibility that host defense peptides and other immune agents such as copper and oxidized lipids synergize their antimicrobial effects has not been explored on a molecular level. The PIs will test this hypothesis using peptides from fish (piscidins) and ticks (ixosins). They will leverage their expertise in the characterization of membrane assemblies and harness a platform of cutting-edge biophysical techniques (solid-state NMR, neutron diffraction, surface-sensitive methods) and biological assays to obtain structure-dynamics-function information on these metallopeptides under native-like conditions. The project will focus on model membranes to accurately and precisely control membrane composition and directly relate their molecular contents to specific functional and conformational behaviors of host defense metallopeptides and their interactions with bilayers. The project will feature assays on live cells relevant to the biological context of the chosen host defense peptides to investigate the contribution of lipid oxidation to the antimicrobial potency of the peptides, identify synergistic effects among peptides, and relate biological potencies to physicochemical properties. This project will generate multiple broad impact outcomes. First, the new findings and methodologies created will contribute to advancing scientific knowledge in the fields of membrane biophysics, structural biology, immunology, and biochemistry.

However, recent discoveries have found that there is a rather large subset of proteins (including about 30% of the proteins in humans) that do not fold; instead, their shape continually fluctuates like a wriggling piece of spaghetti. These disordered proteins are also distinguished from folded proteins by their composition and typically contain a larger number of electrically-charged subunits in comparison to folded proteins. This project will investigate the link between the highly-charged composition and the fluctuating structure of disordered proteins. The experiments conducted using modern physical methods that will permit new insight into protein shape and its fluctuations. This project will particularly focus on important proteins found in muscle and in neurons. This research project will have broad, long-term impacts in training young scientists, as well as forming an international collaboration. <br/><br/>Intrinsically-disordered proteins (IDPs) are frequently enriched in charged residues, and subject to regulatory control through phosphorylation. Thus, electrostatic interactions are dominant in defining and modulating chain structure. For IDPs, structure is a dynamic concept, as the proteins fluctuate through a large ensemble of available conformationa. The overarching goal of this proposal is to study the effects of electrostatic interactions on dynamic IDP structure. This project will focus on two important disordered proteins: i) the PEVK region of the muscle protein titin, a highly-charged domain whose entropic elasticity helps define the passive elasticity of muscle; and ii) the C-terminal tails of neuromuscular intermediate filament (NIF) proteins, whose electrostatic interactions drive the assembly of filaments into hydrogel networks that define the cytoskeleton of axons. The dynamic structure of PEVK and NIFs will be studied by using quantitative experimental methods and concepts derived from soft-matter physics, including low-force single-molecule stretching to infer dynamic structure from entropic elasticity, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. Electrostatic effects will be studied by exploring the effect on structure of different solution salt conditions, as well as exploring the effects of phosphorylation, and of varying chain charge profiles. The combination of SAXS and single-molecule manipulation measurements will lead to quantitative, microscopic insight into biologically-relevant mechanisms of electrostatic control of IDP structure.  <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation."

This platform which uses the tools of synthetic biology will allow researchers to develop such understanding much more rapidly. Such efforts are central to a broad range of applications in both applied and basic science. It may help with the development of new strains for the production of pharmaceutical proteins, enzymes, chemicals, or fuels. It will also help to develop forward engineering paradigms central to the future of bioengineering. In the development of this platform, the investigators will also train multiple graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) approaches and technologies.  These students will develop expertise in experimental and computational methods, the design, execution, and reporting of scientific research, and the generation of intellectual property. <br/><br/>A fundamental goal of synthetic biology is to develop new paradigms for the forward engineering of biological systems. The prototypical forward engineering process involves design, build, test, and learn (DBTL) stages, which ideally are performed in a cyclical and highly parallel fashion leading to the build up of knowledge bases, codified design rules, and optimized designs. In biological endeavors, the ""DBTL"" strategy has historically been realized through ""sequence to activity relationship (SAR)"" mutational mapping, which has traditionally been limited in throughput to addressing only the smallest of biological systems. Advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies however, have paved the way for new massively parallel approaches to SAR that extend to the genome scale. Several technologies that have been developed will be optimized in a generally accessible framework for use by the larger synthetic biology community.  Such a framework will enable new forward DBTL-type engineering strategies at scales that are orders of magnitude more advanced than methods currently available. The investigators in this project have chosen to focus their efforts on the comprehensive mapping of gene essentiality in the model bacterium Escherichia coli because this model system is not only ideal for demonstrating their platform but also will allow them to address foundational questions concerning essentiality, evolvability, epistasis and fitness. This will have broad implications across genetics, synthetic biology and biotechnology."

Cells as diverse as yeast and humans package their DNA with proteins called histones. One particular chemical modification of histone allows cells to recognize, respond to and repair damage to DNA.  However, this histone modification is present in some parts of the DNA but absent in others, and the regions lacking this special modification have a reduced response to damaged DNA.  This project will determine how this particular modification is excluded from some histones, and what role this exclusion has in normal cell growth.  The outcomes of this work will greatly improve our understanding of how humans and other organisms respond to environmental insults that damage DNA, and provide a vehicle for training graduate students in the thinking and practice of science.  This project will also provide undergraduate students with their first experience in scientific research beyond the classroom, and with real-world applications of their science, technology and math skills before entering the work force. <br/><br/>Telomeres are the regions at the ends of chromosomes, and the manner in which the stable telomere ends are distinguished from the unstable ends generated by double-strand breaks elsewhere in chromatin is a fundamental question in the fields of genome integrity and chromosome biology.  While double-strand breaks cause growth arrest and promote genomic instability by DNA recombination, telomeres have functions that allow continuous cell growth and the complete replication of the chromosome end.  Telomeres are composed of DNA repeat tracts bound by specific proteins, and previous studies have focused on the role of telomere proteins in suppressing recombination and cell cycle arrest.  However, recent work in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has implicated an epigenetic modification in this process.  Specifically, a key feature that prevents damaged telomeres with bound DNA damage response proteins from causing cell cycle arrest is the lack of dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2) in nucleosomes near the telomere DNA.  The H4K20me2 modification is conserved from S. pombe to mammals, and its absence near telomeres is thought to allow them to incur damage and still allow cell growth, making telomeres a DNA damage checkpoint-exempt region of the genome.  How telomeres exclude H4K20me2 is unknown.  This project will advance our understanding of H4K20me2 exclusion using a rapidly inducible telomere formation system in S. pombe.  This system will be used to determine how the H4K20me2-free state is established.  Defining how much of the chromosomal end excludes H4K20me2 has important implications for the portions of the genome exempt from DNA damage-induced arrest, and also for our understanding of how cells regulate genome stability. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and genetic approaches, this project will determine if the H4K20me2-free state is restricted to telomeres, or also spreads into the adjacent chromatin."

Proteins are a major component of tissues and organs and, to perform their function, they acquire a specific 3-dimentional structure via a process known as folding. A key mechanism regulating the functioning of proteins may be the use of their unfolding/refolding transitions in response to their biomechanical environment. Little is currently known about this process, as its investigation requires novel experimental approaches that can reproduce the force experienced by individual proteins. This CAREER project aims to look beyond the established view of protein folding as a mean to acquire a characteristic 3-dimentional structure and show that proteins operating under force use domain unfolding and refolding in vivo regularly. Understanding these processes will have widespread consequences in comprehending the normal functioning of tissues. Protein folding, as a mechanism of function, is a multifaceted topic, wherein biology meets chemistry, engineering and physics. Educational and outreach activities, integrated with the proposed research goals, include: establishing a new science and technology exhibit, which will explain how protein unfolding and refolding works at molecular level; improving and expanding a biophysics internship program for K-12 students; introducing new graduate-level courses in biophysics and related disciplines; and implementing computer programing as a new ""second language"" for undergraduate students. The PI will engage students in outreach and education activities from several areas of science, while encouraging participation of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the relation between the structure, function and unfolding and refolding dynamics of proteins under force and how this process can swiftly change the stiffness of a tissue, perform useful mechanical work, efficiently store and release energy, and act as an on/off switch to recruit and release ligands. The PI will take advantage of a novel single molecule approach based on magnetic tweezers and covalent attachment. Using this approach, single protein molecules can be exposed to force protocols resembling those experienced in vivo, for up to 15 days, and in the presence of various buffers. This project aims to establish the rules of how protein unfolding and refolding under force determine the behavior of several important systems in nature. Furthermore, this project will provide biomedical researchers with a new perspective on the relation between protein folding and function, which will likely spur development of new therapeutic interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the fact that these circuits share and trade common cellular resources, they are surprisingly able to maintain separate (highly decoupled) functionalities. How can biological circuits be connected yet be decoupled? This project seeks to address this puzzling question. This research will improve our current understanding of natural systems and help create new biological circuits that control cellular behavior for energy, environment, and medical applications. Currently, human-engineered biological circuits are unpredictable and not sufficiently reliable for practical use. The biological discoveries of this project may serve to develop engineering solutions that decouple synthetic biological circuits from each other for predictable and reliable behavior. The research conducted under this project  requires synergy between theory and experiments and between biology and engineering. As such, a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers will be trained, with cross-disciplinary expertise. This project will develop new educational curricula that cross department boundaries. The researchers will organize workshops and invited sessions at national and international conferences on the problems addressed in this project and will present the research at the Cambridge Science Festival and at its satellite event ""Science on the Street"". Teaching materials will be further disseminated to the broader community through MIT's OpenCourseWare and edX.<br/><br/>Modularity dictates that the input/output behavior of a system is practically independent of its context, thus allowing a bottom-up compositional approach to predict the behavior of complex systems. Today, a key challenge when creating biological circuits is that the input/output properties of a module changes unpredictably when the module is in a different context. While many elements contribute to dependence of modules on context, sharing limited cellular resources such as those required for gene expression remains a major unresolved cause of lack of modularity. This project will elucidate general rules to predict the emergent behavior of a circuit from the composition of intended regulatory links and indirect retroactivity arising from resource sharing. This will lead to formulate the breakdown of modularity as the control-theoretic problem of attenuating indirect retroactivity, which will be addressed with a decentralized feedback control solution inspired from nature. The experimental implementation of this solution will elucidate how natural feedback motifs keep homeostasis while working in orchestration and may substantially enhance our ability to create predictable systems in synthetic biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, IMAGE will provide a web-based interactive resource for dissemination of grant writing and career development resources, as well as for mentoring. This online resource will make information obtained through the IMAGE program widely available to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The IMAGE program will provide intensive mentoring on grantsmanship skills and career development strategies over a three-year period. Senior postdoctoral scientists and early-stage Assistant Professors from groups under-represented in science will attend annual mentoring workshops focusing on grant-writing, peer mentoring, and career development advice, as well as receiving one-on-one structured mentoring where each participant will be paired with a senior, successful scientist who has a strong track record of securing federal funding.

This research investigates how several agents of the immune response combine their antimicrobial effects by interacting with each other on bacterial cell membranes. The specific agents of interest are host defense peptides and copper ions. Host defense peptides are powerful molecules that act on a broad range of pathogenic cells, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Copper ions, which are present in immune cells, can damage the cell membranes of bacteria by oxidizing their phospholipids. Interestingly, some host-defense peptides contain a copper-binding motif that enables them to bind copper and become metallopeptides. In this project, the PIs will develop new bio-physical and biochemical tools to investigate how host defense metallopeptides and copper ions may synergize their antimicrobial effects. This project has the potential to produce new principles that could be useful to design novel antimicrobial biomaterials. In addition, the project will include activities that engage college and pre-college students from diverse backgrounds in hands-on science and enhance their analytical skills. The PIs will leverage the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of their research, and passion for scientific research to spike scientific interest in young students and prepare high school students for a successful transition to college.  <br/><br/>The major goal of this research is a rigorous investigation of the interplay between host defense mechanisms at biological membranes. The molecular systems of interest are membrane-interacting host defense metallopeptides and other agents of the immune response that have the potential to unify their antimicrobial effects at lipid membranes. While host defense peptides have been studied for their ability to disrupt the conformational arrangement in bacterial cell membranes, the possibility that host defense peptides and other immune agents such as copper and oxidized lipids synergize their antimicrobial effects has not been explored on a molecular level. The PIs will test this hypothesis using peptides from fish (piscidins) and ticks (ixosins). They will leverage their expertise in the characterization of membrane assemblies and harness a platform of cutting-edge biophysical techniques (solid-state NMR, neutron diffraction, surface-sensitive methods) and biological assays to obtain structure-dynamics-function information on these metallopeptides under native-like conditions. The project will focus on model membranes to accurately and precisely control membrane composition and directly relate their molecular contents to specific functional and conformational behaviors of host defense metallopeptides and their interactions with bilayers. The project will feature assays on live cells relevant to the biological context of the chosen host defense peptides to investigate the contribution of lipid oxidation to the antimicrobial potency of the peptides, identify synergistic effects among peptides, and relate biological potencies to physicochemical properties. This project will generate multiple broad impact outcomes. First, the new findings and methodologies created will contribute to advancing scientific knowledge in the fields of membrane biophysics, structural biology, immunology, and biochemistry.

Radiation and dehydration are both forces that damage biological systems.  They are related to each other because both induce the production of free radicals, which are extremely destructive chemical species.  Understanding how proteins may have evolved to resist free radical damage adds to the fundamental understanding of the spectrum of protein properties and capabilities, and has potential long-range impacts for food production, bioengineering, bioremediation, and green chemistry.  Conduct of this research will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, in a broad array of biophysical techniques and quantitative analytical methods.  This project also includes development of novel science outreach and public engagement activities, including educational based performances and presentations for general audiences that are designed to communicate the science of biochemistry under extreme environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project specifically examines a suite of DNA binding proteins from the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans in direct comparison with the homologous proteins from Escherichia coli.  D. radiodurans is one of the most radiation resistant organisms on Earth, surviving radiation doses 2,000 times greater than those that would kill humans or E. coli.  By directly examining the function and stability of the irradiated isolated proteins from this radiation resistant organism alongside the equivalent, homologous proteins from a radiation sensitive organism, the project will answer the question of whether intrinsic radiation resistance is an evolvable protein property in the same way that some proteins have evolved to be heat resistant, acid resistant, or salt resistant.  The paired proteins will be examined under increasing exposure to radiation, UV light, and dehydration for differential effects on their DNA binding affinity, protein folding and stability, enzymatic activity, and affinity for antioxidants.  Because this project examines protein function and stability, it does not simply ask if radiation induced free radicals damage some proteins less frequently than others, it asks if the primary physiological activities (i.e. the important functional parts) of some species of proteins are less susceptible to radiation damage than others, and how that difference originates."

In this collaborative project, investigators from the US (Columbia University) and the UK (John Innes Institute) combine experiments and theory to address the precise control of fission yeast cell size.  The preliminary theoretical model and experimentation has allowed the framing of a novel hypothesis on the role of a specific protein, termed Cdr2, in this process. Control of cell size and cell division is necessary in all living organisms, and understanding the basic dynamics of cell size control offers both new knowledge and insight into diseases where cell size control is impaired. The project provides interdisciplinary training opportunities at the interface between physics (including theory), quantitative experimental methods and cell biology.<br/><br/>To understand the machinery that regulates cell size and cell division requires the integration of theory and experiment, which is a goal of this project. The specific focus is on Cdr2, which is a peripheral membrane binding protein that specifically targets the node area in the middle of the cell. The population of this area ""reports"" the status of cell size to other proteins that prompt the cell to divide.  This project will examine a novel hypothesis that predicts that when Cdr2 reaches a certain threshold concentration at the node region, unbound Cdr2 becomes available to inhibit the downstream regulatory factor, Wee1 kinase. In the absence of free Cdr2, Wee1 inhibits the cell cycle control factors Cdk1/Cyclin B to block entry into mitosis. Thus the inhibition of Wee1 by Cdr2 triggers the entry into mitosis.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

For this process to be economically feasible, valuable products must be made from lignin, a portion of plant material that now remains mostly unused. Lignin is abundant and its chemical composition holds great potential for bioenergy production and biotechnology. This project seeks to use newly developed tools in computational and experimental biology to manipulate bacterial pathways for improved lignin degradation with the ultimate goal of developing effective methods of generating energy in a renewable fashion. A soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, that already degrades a vast array of plant derived compounds will be used in these studies. The degradation capability of this bacterium will be expanded by introducing new genes into the chromosome and by optimizing the expression of the catabolic genes for the desired applications. This integrative project will be accomplished via a multi-disciplinary collaboration, including an international component. Training opportunities will enable students to visit and conduct some of the research in the laboratories of different collaborators. All collaborators have a strong commitment to training students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. This project will be used to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community.<br/><br/>Building on the conceptual framework of synthetic biology, this project will develop A. baylyi as the recipient cell (the chassis) to incorporate genetic modules (devices) to expand bacterial pathways for aromatic compound catabolism. To overcome obstacles that may arise from differences between idealized concepts and biological realities, a novel method of experimental evolution that relies on gene amplification will help optimize metabolic functions. This method exploits the exceptionally high efficiency of natural transformation and homologous recombination in A. baylyi. This bacterium is an ideal chassis for lignin biodegradation because of its powerful genetic system and ability to degrade many aromatic compounds, including those that are toxic to Escherichia coli. Experimental flux analysis and kinetic studies will be used to build dynamical models for the design, optimization, and synthetic expansion of aromatic compound catabolic abilities. Advanced computational tools, developed by a member of this research team, in collaboration with others, will also be applied: Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE). To complement these approaches, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies will examine how the spatial orientation of enzymes can be used to improve catalytic efficiency, target metabolite flow, and prevent toxic intermediates from accumulating.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

However, this paradigm is inherently inefficient to train students in interdisciplinary fields because: (i) students in these settings usually come from different disciplines, thus having different (often non-overlapping) backgrounds, and (ii) curricula in interdisciplinary fields are comprised by subject matters drawn from different, often traditionally disconnected, areas. This is true particularly in the field of systems biology, where students need to master a biological problem, know the theory of dynamical systems, probability, statistics, and be able to program, just to mention a few subjects. Students who take this class at the senior undergraduate and junior graduate levels usually major in biology, mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. As a result of this multilateral skill requirements and the inherent diversity in an interdisciplinary class, some students in the classroom have expertise in some areas and deficits in others.  Students from underrepresented communities are particularly  challenged in the process of social integration into a community of learners. Therefore, early identification of weaknesses of this particular set of students is critical to ensure that they do not drop from STEM training programs. <br/><br/>This project seeks to development of an open-source Web-based cyber-learning tool that allows a team of instructors spanning several scientific disciplines to curate a constellation of interdisciplinary learning resources for the purpose of creating individualized development plans for students. The personalization of the learning plan or syllabus for each student depends on previous knowledge and individual learning goals. This customization is achieved through an information system called ALICE (Adaptive Learning in Interdisciplinary Collaborative Environments), which connects specific units of knowledge (lexias) though a dynamic path and presents it to the student for the purpose of acquiring a set of competencies. ALICE personalizes education by: (1) creating a knowledge map of course material that is unique for each student (personalized syllabus); (2) suggesting individualized paths across the knowledge map based on student competencies/accomplishments; (3) providing accessible Web-based interfaces for students and instructors for storing and presenting class materials, for assessment, and for recording student paths; (4) establishing social networks for collaborative learning of course material through shared problem-solving tasks and for passing the research learning experience from current students to future ones; (5) informing instructors about progress of students and identifying early students at risk. As such ALICE departs from current systems of adaptive learning in that it is centered on competencies that cross disciplinary barriers, thus dissolving artificial boundaries between subject matters and creating opportunities for true interdisciplinary training. We achieve this adaptivity via a mathematical model that takes into account the user's previous knowledge to minimize cognitive overhead in learning new material."

One such motor is dynein which is essential for many cellular processes including transport of chromosomes during cell division, movement of vesicles containing nutrients, and in neuronal migration. How dynein knows when and what cargo to transport requires interactions with other proteins that control dynein function. These interactions are regulated by modification in the protein sequence in regions of dynein that lack regular unique three-dimensional structure and are referred to as intrinsically disordered proteins. Expected results will specifically show how these modifications help in selecting the binding partners, and subsequently what cargo to transport. Understanding this system will ultimately be the basis for the design of synthetic nano-machines that can transport materials on demand. This work will facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the practice of cutting-edge research. In addition, the PI and her team will impact progress in other disciplines at Oregon State University and the region by providing access to biophysical instrumentation, by initiating and organizing an annual NMR workshop and an annual regional one-day conference focused on biophysics, and by implementing hands on demonstrations and science activities of varying complexity to K-12 area schools that include models/animations of protein disorder and structural changes for large-scale demonstrations at the Oregon Museum of Science.<br/><br/>This research addresses how phosphorylation and intrinsic disorder in one subunit of dynein modulate the interaction of dynein with multiple regulatory proteins including dynactin, whose interaction occurs in all eukaryotes and plays an especially important role in neurons, and NudE, a nuclear distribution protein which is essential in diverse processes including kinetochore and centrosome migration. The intrinsically disordered N-terminal 300-amino acid domain of dynein intermediate chain (IC) is responsible for these interactions and is also the hub of most dynein activity. While there is ample evidence for phosphorylation and isoform expression as key to dynein regulation, there are no studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects. This project will specifically focus on: 1) How IC phosphorylation affects the interaction of tissue-specific isoforms of IC with dynactin, 2) How IC phosphorylation selects between regulatory proteins dynactin and NudE, and 3) How IC regulation differs among mammals, Drosophila, and yeast. These outstanding questions about dynein regulation will be addressed using a combination of state-of-the-art NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, synthetic biology, computational methods, and in vivo-based assays and will elucidate how phosphorylation and alternative splicing of intrinsically disordered proteins in general govern their molecular function and ultimately affect the behavior of entire protein interaction networks. Significantly, the use of proteins from yeast, Drosophila and mammalian origin, assesses the different IC processes that evolved for inducing structural changes within highly disordered regions, underscoring the strategic role for protein disorder and IC isoforms in regulation of dynein function."

One (called the dicot strategy) is for the growing tip of the plant to climb upward by producing an elongating stem below it. The alternative strategy (termed the monocot strategy) is for the growing tip to stay protected at the base of the plant and produce a series of leaves that rise above the plant and then grow around it. This latter monocot strategy has the advantage of protecting the growing tip at the base of the plant for much of its life. It enables grasses to survive extensive grazing, and it is the growth strategy that is used by plants like wheat, maize and rice. Despite its use by plants of ecological and agricultural importance, this monocot strategy is not well understood. In this project, a collaborative team of US (University of California, Berkeley) and UK (John Innes Centre) investigators  will use a combination of tools including high resolution imaging and computational methods to test mechanisms that will develop predictive and testable models. These models will describe the processes of growth and shape changes in the monocot leaf. Because the position of the leaf blade has an effect on the amount of light a plant can harvest for photosynthesis, this work could significantly impact crop yield. Biotech industries will benefit from the work, through greater fundamental understanding of processes involved in tissue development. The investigators will be actively engaged in education at all levels, including K-12 and public education, through the development of hands on training activities, YouTube videos, and more traditional methods of diffusion of research findings. <br/><br/>Computational modeling has led to preliminary hypotheses of monocot leaf development. A key idea is that growth is oriented by a polarity field, which is analogous to the way a magnetic field can be used to orient directions of navigation. The observed growth and shape changes of the monocot leaf can then be explained by simple changes in the polarity field and the pattern of growth rates it orients. The aim of this project is to test and further build upon this model and determine whether the polarity fields and the growth rates the model predicts are correct using the maize monocot system (which has the advantage of well-developed genetics and associated technologies.) By looking at markers that highlight the presumed polarity fields and by determining the growth rates in different regions of the leaf, predictions of the model can be tested. Models will also be tested by analyzing mutants in which key transitions of development are disrupted.

By helping to quantitatively resolve certain apparently conflicting observations that have recently been made within a biological system previously thought to be well understood, this project will add fundamentally new understanding of basic mechanisms of cell signaling that may have implications across numerous receptor systems in cell biology. Moreover, due to the broadly important role that receptors, and the biochemical signals they generate, play in virtually every biological process, the new quantitative understanding gained will ultimately impact ongoing efforts to optimally engineer receptor-mediated signaling. This project also includes a broad and detailed set of integrated educational objectives that leverage the specific scientific objectives and activities of this project to reach students at different training stages and from diverse backgrounds. These education and outreach activities involve innovation upon existing programs at the partnering institutions as well as the creation of new outreach efforts that will target larger audiences, such as a summer academy of science for high school students and a collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, FL to develop a live interaction program on cell signaling.<br/> <br/>The biochemical signaling that results upon ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases is accompanied by receptor clustering and internalization, or endocytosis. While it has been understood for decades that endocytosis enables cells to degrade or recycle receptors, the question of how endocytosis ultimately impacts downstream signal propagation remains wide open. For example, even for the highly studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) the literature contains highly cited, yet conflicting reports that conclude that EGFR endocytosis either promotes or impedes downstream signaling through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In this project, the investigators will explore the hypothesis that the intrinsic complexity of the spatiotemporal signaling regulatory mechanisms creates parameter spaces for both answers to be true depending on the cellular context. The complexity of the receptor trafficking and signaling system cannot be fully dissected, however, without integrating quantitative experimental measurements that faithfully reflect cell biology with spatiotemporal computational models. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to combine novel live-cell imaging of gene-edited cell systems with mechanistic models that capture system complexity with unprecedented detail to resolve the kinds of conflicting reports previously mentioned, as well as more recent surprising observations that certain proteins conventionally thought to remain in complex during signal transduction may become physically separated through trafficking processes. Ultimately, the proposed integration of gene-edited cell systems, quantitative live-cell imaging and biochemical measurements, and a spatiotemporal computational model will lead to an entirely new quantitative platform to answer these kinds of questions for EGFR and other receptor signaling systems."

EPR is of central importance to scientific research in the disciplines of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Materials Science. It is a technique which is used to investigate structure and dynamics in a wide variety of samples, ranging from biological molecules to polymers to semiconductors. The information obtained with EPR is then used to understand how these molecules or materials function, and how improved ones can be made. However, the broad applicability of EPR across many scientific disciplines can inhibit effective interaction between groups that use the technique. It is crucial to the overall growth of the field of EPR that advances achieved in one discipline be communicated to researchers in the other disciplines. The SHARED EPR network is designed to ensure these advances are translated from the lab in which they are developed to the labs in which they are needed, no matter what discipline is involved. <br/>The Primary Goals of the network are to: facilitate the advancement of EPR methodology, instrumentation and techniques; foster cross-fertilization and establish new collaborative research opportunities within the U.S. EPR community; and establish international collaborations. The Network will achieve these goals by spearheading the following network activities and training opportunities. An annual Grand Challenge Workshop will be organized in conjunction with a national scientific meeting that brings together a diverse range of EPR researchers to identify and address major issues facing the field of EPR spectroscopy. A web portal will be developed to provide a centralized location for information regarding EPR research and resources and serve as a gateway to the EPR community for non-specialists. The Network will sponsor EPR Technology Transfer Experiences in which students and postdocs spend time and doing experiments in other labs to learn new EPR techniques which they will bring back and implement in their home labs. Pre-college minority students will be supported to participate in a research-based science experience at the Steppingstone Magnetic Resonance Training Center in the Detroit area. International collaborations will be fostered through the interaction of the SHARED EPR Network with the German Priority Program SPP 1601 consortium titled ""New Frontiers in Sensitivity for EPR Spectroscopy: From Biological Cells to Nano Materials.""

Understanding how proteins function is one of the most exciting frontiers of science, and is necessary in order to address societal needs in fields as diverse as renewable energy and agriculture.  The rich and intricate 3-dimensional shapes of more than 100,000 different kinds of proteins are now documented, thanks to revolutionary advances in X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and other methods.  However, while knowing the shape of a machine, for example, seeing a photograph of a sewing machine, might give one a clue as to how it works, a movie of a machine in action is far more revealing.  The goal of this project is to develop new methods to make such ""movies"" of proteins, or stated more precisely, to develop methods to measure the time resolved conformational changes in protein structure (or structural dynamics).  A team of graduate students and undergraduates, working at the interface between physics, chemistry, and biology, and working closely with international collaborators, will tackle this exciting problem, and will emerge well-positioned to become leaders in the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.<br/><br/>""Filming"" proteins in action requires a calibrated tool to measure distances of several nanometers with high throughput and, ideally, sub-millisecond time resolution.  This tool must be compatible with the complex local environments in which proteins perform their functions; ideally, in aqueous solutions although many proteins continue to function as long as they are above about 215K.  The primary goal of the proposed research is to use high-frequency (>200 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) combined with site-directed spin labeling with spin-7/2 Gd3+ moieties to measure time-resolved conformational changes of proteins.  With prior NSF support, the PI and co-PI's collaboration has demonstrated that the simplest possible 240 GHz EPR measurements; measurements of the lineshapes of molecules containing a pair of Gd3+ spin labels; is capable of resolving distances greater than 3 nm even at room temperature.   The proposed research will build on these key developments, focusing primarily on time-resolved distance measurements in the model protein Proteorhodopsin (PR), a photosynthetic trans-membrane proton pump that can be triggered with flashes of light to begin synchronized cascades of conformational changes on time scales ranging from less than 1 microsecond to more than 1 second. The main activities undertaken will be: (1) Developing a simple method based on measuring the lineshape of the Gd3+ EPR line to extract distances and distance distributions in the 1.5-4 nm range from PR doubly labeled with Gd3+.  (2) Measuring conformational changes of PR at temperatures ranging from about 215K (where PR is frozen but active) to room temperature with sub-millisecond time resolution. (3) Pulsed EPR studies of Gd3+ to understand the spin physics of Gd3+ at very high frequencies."

During conjugation, DNA is transferred from one cell to another through a specialized translocation channel. Many of the molecular mechanisms behind the conjugation process remain a mystery. This project will characterize two critical interacting protein components of the conjugation machinery of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, providing insight into how they function, interact, and localize. The research will be designed and conducted by 12 highly qualified and diverse undergraduate students. By attaining this independent, inquiry-driven research experience, students are more likely to remain in science and gain employment or entrance to top-tier graduate programs after graduation. This project will also improve science education by enabling a professor from a diverse community college to do research and learn new techniques.<br/><br/>The subject of this study is a specialized DNA translocation channel known as a Type IV secretion system (T4SS). While the T4SSs found in several Gram-negative bacteria have been well-studied, much less is known about those of Gram-positive bacteria. This project aims to examine the conjugation machinery of Gram-positive bacteria using the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1 of B. subtilis as a model system. Prior results indicate that the ICEBs1 T4SS is composed of ConE and ConB, among other proteins. ConE is a peripheral membrane ATPase that likely energizes DNA transfer and/or channel assembly. The bitopic membrane protein ConB interacts with ConE and is required for its association with the membrane. ConB and ConE will be characterized by a variety of methods including mutagenesis, conjugation assays, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemistry. This research will define the conserved sequence motifs and domains of ConB and ConE that are required for conjugation, interaction, enzymatic function, and oligomerization. As these proteins are conserved, the findings will apply to the conjugation machinery of numerous Gram-positive bacteria and provide a deeper understanding of a major mechanism mediating horizontal gene transfer."

Although recent years have seen numerous advances towards this goal, the sophistication, performance and scale of mammalian genetic circuits trail their microbial counterparts. In this collaborative project, investigators from the US (Boston University) and the UK (University of Warwick) combine experimentation and computational modeling to develop a new genetic technology tool that will enable mammalian cells to respond to a signal to reprogram genetic circuits with memory capabilities.  The memory feature is crucial to enable recordings of past events in complex environments where continuous monitoring is not feasible, which will be potentially useful for biopharmaceutical production.

Serine integrases have advantages over the better characterized tyrosine recombinases due to the presence of recombinase directionality factors that bind to serine integrases to modify its conformation, permitting the reverse reaction to occur. To achieve this goal the PIs will: 1) perform detailed analyses of serine integrase (Bxb1, PhiC31, TP901-1 and TG1) activity and specificity in mammalian cells; 2) design, build and test inducible, rewritable memory switches for biopharmaceutical production; and 3) design, construct, and test a serine recombinase-based genetic circuit with reversible memory capabilities.

Transport is mediated by small vesicles that bud from one compartment, move towards the next compartment, and then fuse in order to deliver their cargo. Vesicular traffic involves a hierarchy of molecular subprocesses linked to one another in time and space. The goal of this project is to model vesicle traffic with the long-term goal of capturing the underlying biophysical principles of this essential cellular process. In addition, this project will support interdisciplinary synergy by providing cross-discipline training opportunities and developing workshops and courses to effectively bridge the gap between biological and physical fields. Importantly, a focus is to advance scientific equity by actively recruiting and mentoring under-represented groups and by participating in programs aimed at increasing representation of minorities and promoting and developing community outreach programs to increase science awareness and literacy. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the formation of vesicles that transport proteins at the ER-Golgi interface. Such vesicles form through the recruitment of the coatomer complex (also called COPI complex) to the nascent bud. The recruitment is mediated by a small GTPase of the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) family. Like all GTPases, ARF acts as a molecular switch by cycling between an inactive state when it is bound to a GDP, and an activated state when it is bound to GTP. Only the active form of ARF can recruit coatomer and initiate vesicle formation. The activation of ARF is mediated by a nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) called GBF1. Hence, GBF1 activates ARF, which then recruits coatomer to make COPI vesicle. In addition to coat recruitment, ARF also regulates the sorting of cargo proteins into the nascent bud, and this process requires that ARF continuously cycle from between the GDP and the GTP-bound state. To facilitate the GTP to GDP conversion, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) called ArfGAP1 is required. Hence, the process of vesicle formation requires, at the very minimum, 4 key components: GBF1, ARF, coatomer and ArfGAP1. While we have descriptive knowledge of each molecular subprocess mediated by each component, we lack the knowledge of how these processes are connected in time and space to result in vesicle formation. We also lack even basic understanding of the governing biophysical principles. Thus, the aim of this project is to elucidate this enigma. We propose four Specific Aims: (1) Determine diffusion type and parameters of the 4 key components in cytosol; (2) Determine membrane association processes for the 4 key components; (3) Determine volume and surface densities and define binding constants and reaction rates for the 4 key components; and (4) Develop mathematical models describing the formation of the ternary coating complex. We will measure the dynamic properties of the 4 key components by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) under various experimentally induced conditions to mathematically describe their behavior. The resulting models will be refined through targeted perturbations of the system. Our models will provide the framework for future integration of other participants such as cargo proteins, lipids and a multitude of known regulatory factors that together ensure specificity to vesicular traffic. We stress that the machineries and the mechanisms we will model are highly conserved, and that analogous processes mediate coating of other types of vesicles for transport between different cellular compartments. Thus, our models will be generally applicable and will form an obligatory foundation for understanding the biophysical processes that govern vesicle traffic. A systems understanding of vesicle coating based on the laws of physics is crucial for future manipulation in vivo and for building synthetic organelles and cells.<br/>The funding for this project comes from both the Division of Molecular and Cell Biology and the Division of Mathematical Sciences"

At the cellular level, plant growth involves two distinct processes, cell division, which produces new cells, and cell expansion, which increases the size of the cells.  During division, the cell doubles its DNA content and subsequently the cell divides to form two cells, a process known as the mitotic cell cycle.  During the cell expansion phase of growth, many plant cells continue a modified version of the cell cycle, in which the DNA content doubles but the cell does not divide.  Examples of economically important cell types that double their DNA without division include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  In addition, this process plays important roles in cell differentiation, and is essential for nitrogen fixation in legume root nodules, but the detailed mechanism of this modified cell cycle remains poorly understood.  A protein (known as SIM) has been identified that functions as an inhibitor of cell division, but allows DNA replication.  The goal of this project is to understand how SIM regulates the balance between division and DNA replication during plant growth.  The project will also play a role in the education of graduate students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds, will test the effectiveness of the film as a classroom teaching tool, both in learning course content, and on student attitudes towards science, and will train undergraduates in mathematical modeling for the biological sciences.<br/><br/>The SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that blocks mitosis without blocking DNA replication.  Although SIM is clearly plays a key role in the transition from mitotic growth to endoreplication, the control of the G2/M transition in plants is complex, and many questions remain about how endoreplication is established, and the role of SIM and related proteins in this process.  The proposed work will use a combination of molecular genetic manipulations, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to test specific hypotheses about the role of SIM and the related SMR proteins in the mitosis/endocycle transition.  The Specific Objectives of this proposal are to answer the following questions: Can a combination of mathematical modeling, genetic and cell biological experiments be used to create a coherent model of inhibition of G2/M during the transition to endocycles? How is degradation of SIM protein regulated?  Do SIM or other SMRs play a role in controlling progression through G2 during the regular mitotic cycle?"

Approximately half of the annual photosynthetic production of organic matter on Earth takes place in the photic zone of the water column in marine environments, making the ocean a major component of the global carbon cycle. Diatoms are one of the most prominent phytoplankton groups and are crucial to maintaining the ecological and biogeochemical equilibrium of marine systems. Diatom photosynthesis is estimated to account for between 25% and 40% of the 45-50 billion tons of organic carbon fixed annually in the sea.  The ability of diatoms to thrive in upwelling-induced, periodically nutrient-rich conditions makes them the basis for the world's shortest and most energy-efficient food webs. Some of the world's largest fisheries are driven and maintained primarily by diatom-based new production: CO2 fixation fueled by upwelled nitrate. Among marine phytoplankton, diatoms are among the best competitors for elevated levels of nitrate, yet the cellular systems providing the competitive advantage of diatoms during coastal upwelling events remain to be fully described. Broadening our physiological and molecular understanding of nitrogen sensing and intracellular metabolism in marine diatoms is an important research focus for microbial sciences and the global marine nitrogen cycle. Our project aims to improve understanding of the cellular systems in diatoms that efficiently and rapidly respond to both increased availability of nitrate in the immediate extracellular environment and reduced concentrations of intracellular nitrate as stores are depleted. Specifically, we will characterize the activity of the major components of the system including sensors, membrane transport proteins, and membrane lipids. The project will also develop educational outreach activities which target primary school students in the areas of microbiology, biogeochemical cycles and biotechnology. These science outreach activities benefit from collaborations with the San Diego-based organization: The League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers (LXS).  <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the poorly understood cellular systems which provide the competitive advantage of diatoms during coastal upwelling events. Ultimately a more thoroughly detailed, mechanistic understanding of diatom nitrate uptake pathways will facilitate a much-improved ability to forecast the impact of anticipated changes in ocean nutrient delivery and associated uptake by diatoms. This critical cellular and biogeochemical issue is centered around efforts to define the molecular components of nitrate sensing in diatoms, identify the metabolic signals that regulate the overall cellular response to nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited conditions, characterize vacuolar nitrate transmembrane channels and pumps, and investigate the composition, biosynthesis and recycling of vacuolar membrane lipids. Specifically the project will employ combination of physiological, conjugative episomal cloning, gene knockouts, protein localization, tagged-ATP biochemistry and cutting edge molecular biological experimental approaches to characterize the activity of the major components of the system: a) sensors that relay information on the availability of nitrate, and metabolite signals, generated in the chloroplast, that trigger the cascade of molecular events necessary to activate transcription;  b) membrane transport proteins i) MFS proteins that pump nitrate across the outer membrane and into the cell under replete conditions, ii) nitrate channels and H+ pumps in vacuolar membranes that transport excess nitrate into vacuoles for storage, iii) the nitrite transporter, embedded in the chloroplast membrane, that delivers nitrite for assimilation via nitrite reductase and GS-GOGAT enzymes; and c) membrane lipids, both newly synthesized and recycled, that are necessary for expansion of vacuolar membranes as excess nitrate is stored. Overall aims of the research activities include, development and validation of a refined conceptual model of nitrate sensing, storage, and uptake in key marine phytoplankton.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transcription was thought to occur exclusively at genes producing protein-coding mRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNAs. However, in the past decade, non-coding regulatory RNAs have emerged as a new class of transcribed genetic elements. More recently, large portions of the genome have been observed to be transcribed; this genome-wide transcription was termed pervasive transcription. Pervasive transcription was initially considered to be non-functional noise; however, there is now evidence suggesting that pervasive transcripts are functional. The objective of this project is to elucidate the function and molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by pervasive transcripts in the well-studied and genetically tractable model organism Escherichia coli. Traditional loss-of-function reverse genetic assays are challenging to perform on these RNAs because they overlap (or are complementary to) annotated genes. Therefore innovative methods to construct deletions of pervasive transcripts will be employed. These deletion strains will allow us to probe the role of pervasive RNAs in gene regulation and to dissect the molecular mechanisms of their regulation. Understanding the regulatory roles of pervasive transcripts, and the mechanisms they employ, in gene expression in E. coli will also offer insight into the gene regulation strategies of other bacteria, as well as eukaryotes, due to the widespread nature of pervasive transcription across all domains of life."

This research investigates how several agents of the immune response combine their antimicrobial effects by interacting with each other on bacterial cell membranes. The specific agents of interest are host defense peptides and copper ions. Host defense peptides are powerful molecules that act on a broad range of pathogenic cells, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Copper ions, which are present in immune cells, can damage the cell membranes of bacteria by oxidizing their phospholipids. Interestingly, some host-defense peptides contain a copper-binding motif that enables them to bind copper and become metallopeptides. In this project, the PIs will develop new bio-physical and biochemical tools to investigate how host defense metallopeptides and copper ions may synergize their antimicrobial effects. This project has the potential to produce new principles that could be useful to design novel antimicrobial biomaterials. In addition, the project will include activities that engage college and pre-college students from diverse backgrounds in hands-on science and enhance their analytical skills. The PIs will leverage the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of their research, and passion for scientific research to spike scientific interest in young students and prepare high school students for a successful transition to college.  <br/><br/>The major goal of this research is a rigorous investigation of the interplay between host defense mechanisms at biological membranes. The molecular systems of interest are membrane-interacting host defense metallopeptides and other agents of the immune response that have the potential to unify their antimicrobial effects at lipid membranes. While host defense peptides have been studied for their ability to disrupt the conformational arrangement in bacterial cell membranes, the possibility that host defense peptides and other immune agents such as copper and oxidized lipids synergize their antimicrobial effects has not been explored on a molecular level. The PIs will test this hypothesis using peptides from fish (piscidins) and ticks (ixosins). They will leverage their expertise in the characterization of membrane assemblies and harness a platform of cutting-edge biophysical techniques (solid-state NMR, neutron diffraction, surface-sensitive methods) and biological assays to obtain structure-dynamics-function information on these metallopeptides under native-like conditions. The project will focus on model membranes to accurately and precisely control membrane composition and directly relate their molecular contents to specific functional and conformational behaviors of host defense metallopeptides and their interactions with bilayers. The project will feature assays on live cells relevant to the biological context of the chosen host defense peptides to investigate the contribution of lipid oxidation to the antimicrobial potency of the peptides, identify synergistic effects among peptides, and relate biological potencies to physicochemical properties. This project will generate multiple broad impact outcomes. First, the new findings and methodologies created will contribute to advancing scientific knowledge in the fields of membrane biophysics, structural biology, immunology, and biochemistry. These fundamental principles could be useful to design novel antimicrobial agents and biomaterials. Second, the scientific environment will foster partnerships between academia and national labs.

Such customized organisms have the potential to produce a wide range of beneficial products for humankind, but their activities must be strictly controlled. At present, there are few highly robust control systems available to synthetic biologists, therefore the discovery and development of additional regulatory pathways is of paramount importance. Building on recent discoveries in a highly abundant, photosynthetic marine bacterium, this project uses mathematical modeling to predict the mechanism through which shifting ambient light color from green to blue results in a 35-40-fold increase in the bacterium's gene expression. The project also involves the use of molecular, genetic, and biochemical tools to test the models and define the photo-regulation process. This system has tremendous potential for significantly contributing to the areas of microbial biotechnology, green chemistry and the new and rapidly growing field of optogenetics. In addition to the basic scientific value of the project there is training received, by three graduate students, in modeling and molecular genetics research. There is also training received, in science pedagogy, by high school teachers. Students from underrepresented groups in science benefit from a summer research immersion program at Indiana University.<br/><br/>Mathematical modeling is used to predict the mechanism through which a newly discovered signal transduction pathway operates. Predictions from the model are tested using molecular biological and biochemical approaches. Diametrically regulated by blue and green light and widely used by Synechococcus, this simple but robust signaling system is unique. The regulation element consists of three regulatory proteins named FciA, FciB, and FciC, and three genes whose expression is highly upregulated in blue light and downregulated in green light. FciA either operates with, or independently of, FciC, and modeling these components provides weighted evidence for one of these two models. Using RNAseq and Western blot analyses a time course of RNA and protein responses is examined after a switch from growth in green light to growth in blue light. Both in vitro and in vivo approaches are used to determine the specific DNA sequences that are bound by FciA, FciB, and FciC. Methods include Electromobility Shift Assays, DNaseI footprinting, and exoChIPseq. Finally, the signaling system is transferred to another cyanobacterial species and to a non-photosynthetic bacterium to begin to develop this regulatory system for use in species that are commonly used in microbial biotechnology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this process to be economically feasible, valuable products must be made from lignin, a portion of plant material that now remains mostly unused. Lignin is abundant and its chemical composition holds great potential for bioenergy production and biotechnology. This project seeks to use newly developed tools in computational and experimental biology to manipulate bacterial pathways for improved lignin degradation with the ultimate goal of developing effective methods of generating energy in a renewable fashion. A soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, that already degrades a vast array of plant derived compounds will be used in these studies. The degradation capability of this bacterium will be expanded by introducing new genes into the chromosome and by optimizing the expression of the catabolic genes for the desired applications. This integrative project will be accomplished via a multi-disciplinary collaboration, including an international component. Training opportunities will enable students to visit and conduct some of the research in the laboratories of different collaborators. All collaborators have a strong commitment to training students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. This project will be used to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community.<br/><br/>Building on the conceptual framework of synthetic biology, this project will develop A. baylyi as the recipient cell (the chassis) to incorporate genetic modules (devices) to expand bacterial pathways for aromatic compound catabolism. To overcome obstacles that may arise from differences between idealized concepts and biological realities, a novel method of experimental evolution that relies on gene amplification will help optimize metabolic functions. This method exploits the exceptionally high efficiency of natural transformation and homologous recombination in A. baylyi. This bacterium is an ideal chassis for lignin biodegradation because of its powerful genetic system and ability to degrade many aromatic compounds, including those that are toxic to Escherichia coli. Experimental flux analysis and kinetic studies will be used to build dynamical models for the design, optimization, and synthetic expansion of aromatic compound catabolic abilities. Advanced computational tools, developed by a member of this research team, in collaboration with others, will also be applied: Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE). To complement these approaches, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies will examine how the spatial orientation of enzymes can be used to improve catalytic efficiency, target metabolite flow, and prevent toxic intermediates from accumulating.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

The two macromolecular systems involve large protein complexes and share physical processes as well as constituent proteins. The project combines molecular electronics, stochastic quantum mechanics, and molecular dynamics methods to answer critical questions in bioenergetics: how do the many participating processes coordinate themselves and, in some cases, how do they achieve actually their conversion function? The research strategy for the two systems is anchored in the PI's four decades of work, including work on the photosynthetic apparatus of purple bacteria. In case of the first system, the supramolecular organization of the thylakoid membrane will be determined along with its energy transfer and conversion processes. In case of the second system, the ability of the respiratory complexes of mitochondria to harness energy will be determined on the basis of published structures. For both systems a detailed computational description of energy storage and transduction will be provided that extends understanding of these systems beyond what is provided by experiment alone.

The stringent response causes growth-related genes to be turned off and genes that are needed for survival under nutrient-limiting conditions to be activated.  This response is absent in obligate intracellular human pathogens such as Chlamydia, which only grow inside a host cell.  The aim of this project to understand how these bacterial pathogens cope with starvation, since they lack the stringent response and yet they are often able to survive amino acid starvation, which is induced by the human host to combat the infection. This project will address fundamental questions about the evolution of pathogens and the unique manner in which they respond to starvation.  More practically, it will result in the identification of potential drug and diagnostic targets to treat and identify diseases caused by pathogens such as Chlamydia.  In an effort to broaden participation, several strategies will be used to increase participation of American Indians in college-level research. Some of these students will present their research to their alma mater high schools to help encourage the students to pursue college degrees in STEM. In addition, various science-themed activities will be used to increase interest/awareness/participation of American Indian high school and college students in STEM. <br/><br/>This study aims to understand the adaptations and their consequences in evolving to obligate intracellular growth. The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia has minimized its genome by eliminating the stringent response and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. The stringent response is activated when an uncharged tRNA binds in the A site of the ribosome, leading to (p)ppGpp synthesis, a global regulator that, in part, regenerates amino acid pools. Chlamydia does not make tryptophan (trp) or (p)ppGpp thus how it survives trp starvation is not well understood. Prior work by the PI has shown that Chlamydia globally increases its transcription in response to trp starvation while globally decreasing its translation. This observation is unusual for a bacterium, and therefore, represents a unique opportunity to advance knowledge. How the amino acid content of a transcript affects gene expression during starvation has not been fully characterized. The hypothesis is that, during trp limitation, chlamydial gene expression is determined by the trp content of the encoded protein. The goals of this project are the following: 1) to determine if the trp content of open reading frames controls transcription during trp starvation; 2) to determine if trp-free proteins are preferentially translated during trp starvation; 3) to compare and contrast the chlamydial response to trp starvation (1&2) with that of other trp auxotrophs, Streptococcus pyogenes (wild-type and stringent mutant) and Coxiella. The major goal of the broader impacts of this project is to increase participation of American Indians in STEM research.  In conjunction with the Native Studies Program, the PI also plans to develop a course on science in the context of the American Indian worldview."

The exact structural positioning of the energy transforming protein complexes in the membrane on the 100 nanometer length scale (called the mesoscopic level) is a key element for the functionality and regulation of biological energy conversion. Missing information about mesoscopic characteristics and their dynamic response to environmental cues represents a significant gap in the knowledge base. In particular, it is not understood what factors determine mesoscopic features in thylakoid membranes and what physicochemical forces are involved. The proposed work aims to fill this critical gap. Knowing how plants optimize and regulate photosynthetic energy conversion on the mesoscopic length scale will not only have a direct impact on basic photosynthesis research but also has a strong eco-physiological component by understanding how changes in plant habitats control photosynthetic performance via modifications in mesoscopic membrane features. The computer model that will be developed in the proposed work has the potential to unravel the underlying design principles of the photosynthetic machinery that can be used for the identification of new approaches to design crop plants. The importance of mesoscopic characteristics and dynamics of thylakoid membranes in improving crop plants has been neglected thus far. Furthermore, the proposed work has a strong focus on high-quality education of students and postdocs. Based upon previous successful experiences with NSF-supported undergraduates, six undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be recruited and offered supported research training opportunities. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to unravel the role of the lipid composition and reversible protein phosphorylation for mesoscopic protein organization and its dynamics in stacked grana thylakoid membranes (covers about 60% of the whole thylakoid membrane). The central hypothesis is that physicochemical properties of the lipid matrix and the phosphorylation of grana hosted proteins are key determinants for the supramolecular protein arrangement in grana. The PI and his collaborators will determine the impact of the lipid matrix for the supramolecular protein organization in grana. The photosystem II (PSII) arrangement in grana membranes will be mapped and mathematically analyzed for wildtype (WT) and lipid and fatty acid mutants by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on freeze-fractured membranes. Next, the mesoscopic dynamics induced by reversible protein phosphorylation will be determined by comparing PSII maps of WT protein with those of mutants with protein hyper- or hypo-phosphorylation. Finally, the forces that control protein ensemble behavior will be determined by applying coarse grain computer modeling. The project will provide unprecedented insight into structure-function relationship of photosynthetic membranes on the mesocopic level and in addition to in-depth structural characterizations of changes in the mesoscopic protein organization and PSII supercomplex stability by alterations of the lipid/fatty acid composition or protein phosphorylation pattern. This contribution is significant because it identifies central mechanisms that control and regulate supramolecular protein dynamics in stacked thylakoid membranes required for efficient photosynthetic energy conversion in ever-changing environments.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation."

At the focus of this research project are two proteins that are extremely similar in size, shape, and general features, yet behave quite differently. Both proteins are exceptional in that they attach to other proteins to alter their fate; in this manner, the influence of these two ""protein modifiers"" extends to essentially every aspect of cell biology. Yet, as similar as these two sibling proteins are, one is promiscuous - and as its name Ubiquitin implies, is ubiquitous throughout the cell - whereas the other ""Resembles Ubiquitin 1"" (Rub1) is shy and relegated. How does this happen? What are the molecular recognition devices that decide to give Ubiquitin free rein to roam throughout the cell, yet corral its more introvert sibling, Rub1, to a more localized pen? Correspondingly, their chores differ too: whereas Ubiquitin causes countless proteins to be sent to the cellular dump yards, Rub1 actually encourages its (carefully selected) targets to function properly. In joint teamwork, the laboratories of Prof Fushman at University of Maryland and Prof Glickman at Technion-IIT have found that Ubiquitin and Rub1 are not quite as segregated as generally thought. By molecular trickery some Rub1 appears to masquerade as ubiquitin and vice versa. Does this reflect inefficiencies in molecular recognition security checks, or does some fuzziness in their respective tasks play a positive role in cellular survival? Using a slew of biophysical, biochemical and molecular cell biology tools at their disposal, this project aims at understanding the unique properties of Rub1 and Ubiquitin and how these two proteins signal for distinct cellular outcomes despite their overwhelming similarities. Designing unique mutations, this project will study what happens when Rub1 and Ubiquitin swap roles inside cells. How far can one push molecular trickery before the cellular defenses catch on and either overcome the trespassers, or as in some pathological cases, apparently give up? The results of this research project will clarify just how recycling of old proteins through the use of Ubiquitin modification, helps keep cells young and healthy.<br/><br/>This project aims at detailed comparison of Ubiquitin and Rub1, their physico-chemical properties, the conjugation targets/landscapes, and their binding partners in order to understand their unique properties and how these proteins signal for distinct cellular outcomes despite their overwhelming similarities. The research will test the hypothesis that although the two proteins are present as separate modifiers across eukarya, they are not maintained as completely non-interchangeable signals, and the cellular machinery allows for some cross-activation, primarily of Rub1 into the Ubiquitin signaling system. The mechanisms, prevalence, and the outcomes of such cross-activation are in the focus of this project. To achieve these goals, three Aims have been formulated. The first is to compare structural, biophysical, and biochemical characteristics of Rub1 and Ubiquitin as monomers and their ability to form polymers (homogeneous and mixed). By using established enzymatic and binding assays for each signal, this research will map at the atomic/residue level the distinguishing properties that define Rub1 and Ubiquitin as separate signals. The second Aim is to chart the extent of the ""Rubylome"" (i.e., the repertoire of Rub1 conjugation targets) and how it compares with the more extensively studied ""Ubiquitinome"". Studies of the Rubylome have been significantly hampered by the inability of current approaches to properly distinguish Rub1 and Ubiquitin conjugation sites. By using an innovative mass spectrometry approach, this project will obtain a full picture of unique versus shared conjugation targets, in particular the extent to which mixed Rub1-Ubiquitin polymers exist. The third Aim is to reveal to what extent Ubiquitin and Rub1 are maintained as separate signals in vivo, and what is the cellular outcome of their cross-activation. By engineering Rub1 and Ubiquitin variants capable of penetrating each other's signaling pathways, both in cells and in reconstituted enzymatic cascades, this research will characterize the resulting perturbations. Information garnered will be used to understand the unique properties of Rub1 and of Ubiquitin that enable these two proteins to act as distinct cellular signals. These comprehensive studies and comparison of Ubiquitin to Rub1 and of the outcomes of their cross-activation will (i) identify unique cellular conjugation targets and receptors for Rub1, (ii) reveal the inherent determinants of the Rub1 signal and the Ubiquitin signal, and (iii) provide a better understanding of what makes ubiquitin Ubiquitin.

This is particularly important in developing embryos where cell communication is responsible for creating the patterns which are the  template  for  the  formation  of  functioning  organs.  In this project which is a collaboration between researchers at the California Institute of Technology (US) and the Francis Crick Institute (UK), investigators will use a novel quantitative approach to examine signaling in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (a signaling pathway very important in development) at the single cell level that leads to neural patterning in a model tissue culture system. The results will elucidate the mechanism that controls the precision of cell fate decision and tissue patterning   in  the  developing   spinal  cord.  These   broader impacts of these principles   are  likely   to  be  relevant   for understanding other signaling pathways involved in diverse developmental processes. This project will also provide a unique opportunity for training graduate students at the interface of biology and computation.<br/><br/>During embryonic development and in response to injury, tissues must establish, or re-establish, precise  spatial  arrangements  of  specific  cell  types.  A  common  strategy  of  tissue  patterning involves morphogens; locally produced, secreted molecules that diffuse to form concentration gradients. These gradients provide the tissue with positional information that is used to regulate spatially specific genes controlling cell fate decisions. Moreover, morphogens also regulate the downstream   target   genes   that   can   affect   the   morphogen   movement,   intracellular   signal transduction and the elaboration of target gene expression. This provides a means for morphogens to generate  gradients  and positional  information  with context-specific  shapes and dynamics  to instruct tissue pattern formation. A key  limitation  in understanding the architecture of pathways that control morphogen expression has  been  the  lack  of direct  readout  and  control  in embryonic tissues. To address this deficiency, this research project will combine novel quantitative single- cell and tissue engineering approaches in well-defined  cellular model systems. The aim of this project is to understand the design principles that produce the dynamics and gene responses of the Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, which are involved in diverse developmental processes, in particular patterning  the neural system. The following fundamental  questions about morphogen-mediated tissue patterning will be addressed: (1) How are the dynamics of morphogen gradients generated and controlled? (2) How do the genes in individual cells interpret the quantitative, dynamic information encoded by morphogens into discrete cell fates? (3) How do fluctuations, or ""noise"", limit the precision of patterning, and how do cells overcome these limitations?  A broader impact of this project will be predictive, quantitative models connecting morphogen dynamics to cell fate decision-making,  which  provides  insights  into numerous  Shh-dependent  processes  in embryos and organisms, and also enables researchers to control and repurpose Shh signaling in order to engineer patterning in manufactured tissues.

Central to the success of the charophyte colonization of land was the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds their cells. This ECM is made up of a wall that covers the outside of the cell and the gel-like substances that are secreted from these organisms.

The ECM and its related biosynthetic processes will be studied using cutting edge technologies that were previously funded by the National Science Foundation. This research will provide insight into the mechanisms that were important to initiate survival on land by ancient charophytes, as well as mechanisms that are still used by many land plants today. This information will be used to devise models of how plants adapt to life on land and how they tolerate non-biological stresses such as drought.

Specific areas to be studied include: (A) polar cell growth in Penium, with an emphasis on pectin and cellulose production during wall expansion; (B) the secretion of ECM components involving two distinct pathways, the cell wall polysaccharides delivered to specific expansion zones along with extracellular polymeric substances extracellular (EPS) targeted to transitory secretion sites; (C) changes in cell wall architecture; and (D) EPS targeted production and delivery that are critical for tolerating abiotic stresses. The results of this project will be of significance to the fields of plant evolutionary biology, cell biology, molecular biology, and developmental biology. This project will also provide significant opportunities for outreach and student training."

These machines use the work to help either assemble or disassemble cellular structures during vital cell processes. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these biological machines and their relationship with conformational changes in their substrates are among the challenges of modern molecular biology. This project uses computational modeling at multiple scales to elucidate how a class of molecular machines associated with microtubules accomplishes the severing of this largest structure in the cytoskeleton, whose dynamic organization and rearrangement is an essential process of cell division, motility, and development. This research will address a critical gap in our understanding of the dynamic properties of microtubules and their complexes with microtubule associated proteins undergoing wear and their dependence on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input and will lead to a better understanding of how molecular machines work. The project will provide education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational biophysical chemistry by involving them in interdisciplinary scientific projects and increase the participation of groups underrepresented in science through the outreach at local Cincinnati Public School and through research experience opportunities for freshmen students participating in the ""Women in Science and Engineering"" program at the University of Cincinnati. The results of the project will be disseminated to the public by the investigator, postdoc, and students through publications, conference presentations, and visits to local schools. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate the major remodeling action of microtubules performed by severing enzymes from the ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities (AAA+) family. The multiscale simulations will determine molecular and thermodynamic parameters that characterize the breaking of a microtubule filament according to the proposed severing mechanisms. Because the action of AAA+ proteins is known to involve the application of pulling forces on their substrate proteins, in this project simulations that can reach the long time and length-scales required to follow the action of severing enzymes, primarily katanin in its hexameric functional states, will be complemented by experiments conducted by collaborators to extract markers of the unfoldase action on microtubules. Furthermore, the contribution of allosteric transitions between the active states of these hexameric enzymes to microtubule disassembly will be established. The combination of coarse-grained simulations and experiments will ultimately provide quantitative insight into the power stroke action of severing enzymes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cells of complex organisms contain compartments called organelles that endow cells with their specific functional properties.  While many organelles are common to all of the cells within an organism, some are only generated in a subset of cell types.  One of these, called a lysosome-related organelle (LRO), plays varied and important roles, however only certain animal cells generate them.  The research will investigate how this is achieved and identify factors that promote the formation of LROs.  Many undergraduates (25-55/year)will be mentored in collaborative, investigative, and original research as part of the project.  Many of these students will come from underrepresented groups in the sciences.  The work will provide hands on scientific training for a large and diverse group of students, most of who will progress on to careers in science and education.<br/><br/>In many cell types, lysosome-related organelles LROs co-exist with conventional lysosomes due to the activity of conserved LRO-specific trafficking pathways that divert cargo away from endolysosomes.  The emergence of LRO biogenesis pathways likely result from the poorly understood interplay of general endolysosome trafficking factors expressed in all cells with key regulators that are only present and active within LRO-containing cells.  To identify and investigate the function of these regulators, the project is analyzing the biogenesis of C. elegans gut granules, cell type-specific LROs that co-exist with conventional lysosomes.  Some LRO biogenesis factors identified in this system have cell type restricted expression and likely regulate the diversion of cargo to LROs.  The research addresses the function of one of these, GLO-3, which is proposed to redirect the function of CCZ-1, a RAB-7 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), away from conventional endolysosomal pathways, toward the GLO-1 Rab to regulate LRO biogenesis.  The research will involve detailed phenotypic analysis of mutants, yeast 2-hybrid screens, and in vitro GEF assays.  The research will examine whether expressing GLO-3 and other LRO biogenesis factors are sufficient to direct the trafficking of LRO cargo away from conventional endosomes in cell types that do not normally generate LROs.  The research will employ a novel genetic resource to identify nearly all of the genes necessary for LRO biogenesis in C. elegans."

While chemically synthesized inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are effective in increasing crop yields, they are costly and also have a negative impact on the environment, especially on aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, sustainable agriculture relies on biological nitrogen fixation as an economically attractive and ecologically viable source of new nitrogen. The conversion of molecular nitrogen into ammonia is performed by bacteria (Rhizobia) that live in symbiosis with leguminous plants such as peas, soy beans, and alfalfa. The research will be carried out using the symbiotic model system, the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti). The process of chemotaxis enables motile rhizobia to preferentially move in the soil towards host plant roots and supports efficient interaction between symbiosis partners. Many motile bacteria are propelled by means of rotating flagella, driven by a powerful, self-assembling nanomachine. The unique flagellar motor and the specially adapted chemotaxis system of S. meliloti make cells more efficient at maneuvering in the viscous soil environment, leading to better survival and optimal interaction with their host plant alfalfa. Previous research uncovered several novel molecular mechanisms governing chemotactic responses and motility in S. meliloti, thereby setting the stage for an in-depth analysis of the underlying molecular events. The overarching goal of this project is to analyze the specific adaptations that occurred in S. meliloti motility and chemotaxis due to the soil habitat and communication with its plant host. The first objective of the research analyzes the roles of two novel proteins in the response of S. meliloti to quickly changing environmental signals, which is essential for bacterial survival. The second objective determines the cellular concentrations and enzymatic activities of key chemotaxis components, allowing prediction of bacterial behavior in the interaction with alfalfa crop. The third objective will identify the function of newly discovered flagellar motor components in facilitating effective movement of S. meliloti in the soil and towards symbiosis partners. This research will lead to the discovery of significant bacterial properties and impact current understanding of how bacterial symbionts respond to plant signals and efficiently move through soil.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>     The project directly benefits future agricultural and environmental issues for society. By enhancing understanding of the cues that bacterial symbionts use to efficiently interact with their host crop, the research will impact biological nitrogen fixation and thus crop yields and reduce the use of detrimental synthetic fertilizers. The project will also vertically integrate research activities with educational activities through the development of an undergraduate classroom exercise addressing currently open research questions, which will transform into scientific discoveries in the research laboratory. The existing, successful outreach program of the Microbiology Club of Virginia Tech will be expanded to rural, underdeveloped communities of Appalachia. Outreach activities in the form of interactive lectures and hands-on activities will promote scientific awareness across the educational spectrum, including a local 4-H Agricultural Club and rural elementary schools. Studies of motility and chemotaxis can be demonstrated easily and will allow the development of innovative, inquiry-based microbiology lessons with High School science teachers, a valuable strategy for effective learning. Collaboration with Novozymes? BioAgricultural Group will give Virginia Tech students the opportunity not only to experience basic research approaches at the university and applied research in industry through merged collaborative training programs, but also to increase their chances for recruitment into professional careers. Overall, this project integrates research and education through the fusion of classroom and laboratory research, hands-on outreach activities in rural communities, and internships in industry, which will promote student engagement and transform student learning and will permanently stimulate student's interest in science."

Signaling systems are composed of a cluster of genes and their expression products, proteins, which can interact with each other by controlling the expression of the corresponding gene. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of a group of genes within signaling systems and do so by binding to a specific DNA sequence motif upstream of targeting genes. By measuring the amount of transcription factors from a population of cells with traditional biochemistry assays, biologists have shown that environmental inputs (i.e., stresses or extracellular   ligands)  can  alter  the  concentrations of transcription factors that  regulate  gene expression. The objective of this project is to understand  how individual cells encode external inputs as time-based signals and how these signals are transmitted to downstream genes, and to examine how the single cell behavior differs from the behavior of the population of cells.  The collaborative team of investigators from the California Institute of Technology (US) and the University of Edinburgh (UK) will use new single-cell measurements based on fluorescent protein and time-lapse   optical microscopy techniques can provide new and distinct information about the signal processing capabilities of individual cells. Through its broader impacts, this project will promote understanding of the dynamic nature of cellular information processing. Furthermore, this project will provide new techniques and tools to perturb and control cell functions.<br/><br/>Cellular  signaling  is  fundamental  to  many  biological  processes,  from  embryo  development  to disease progression. It is often considered to be a continuous and concentration-based  process, where  extracellular  input is encoded  in the concentrations  of one or more  transcription  factors (TFs) or other regulators, which are in turn decoded to control gene expression in a continuous fashion. In contrast, recent single-cell studies have revealed that many central TFs are activated in stochastic pulses in response to inputs. Examples include nuclear factor-kappa-B and p53 in mammals, and the general stress regulator Msn2 in yeast. In these systems, inputs generate pulses of TF activity, which are then decoded by target promoters in a dynamic fashion. The extent of signal encoding and decoding in pulsing systems as well as the potential physiological functions of these systems  remain  largely  unexplored.  This project  will address  these  questions  in budding  yeast through collaborative efforts between the Swain and the Elowitz  laboratories.  The  team  will integrate single-cell time-lapse microscopy, microfluidics, and techniques from information theory to measure the information transfer within dynamic signaling systems by investigating the encoding and decoding of TF dynamics in single cells. This project will contribute to the understanding  of three aspects  of dynamic  signaling:  First, the team will produce  an extensive  dataset  of input- output relationship between stresses and TF dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of dynamic cellular responses. Second, information theoretical analysis of single-cell signaling will provide a more comprehensive view of dynamics-based information transduction and pulse-based signal encoding and decoding. Third, it will explore the physiological roles of dynamic pulsing, to open up the possibility of controlling cellular behaviors through the perturbation of TF dynamics. Through its broader impacts, this analysis of pulse-based signaling in cells should allow scientists to understand the design principles of natural signaling systems.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

The remaining 1500 member mitochondrial proteome, including additional components necessary for energy production and the enzymatic machinery required for mitochondrial DNA expression, is encoded by the nuclear genome. To respond to metabolic changes, mitochondrial gene expression must be coordinated with nuclear gene expression. While the control of nuclear DNA transcription is widely studied, there is a need to understand the mechanisms that control the transcription of mitochondrial DNA. The objective of the project is to determine whether reversible protein post-translational modification regulates mitochondrial DNA transcription. Post-translational modifications, specifically lysine acetylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation, are widely found in the mitochondrial proteome, including on the proteins required for mitochondrial DNA transcription. The research will investigate how these chemical tags provide a means to regulate transcription in response to changes in cellular metabolism. To address this question, a combination of cell biology and protein biochemistry will be used to map the regulatory post-translational modification sites on protein components required for mitochondrial DNA transcription. The biochemical mechanisms by which these sites control transcription will be determined using transcriptional profiling and DNA binding assays. The research is expected to contribute a mechanism explaining the role of post-translational modifications in regulating mitochondrial DNA transcription in response to changing cellular energetic demands.

The magnetic field of the earth has horizontal and vertical components and while many animals are known to use either the horizontal (e.g. salmon), or the vertical component of the field (e.g. sea turtles), how they detect and translate this information is poorly understood. Determining how animals detect and process magnetic field information will solve one of the modern mysteries of sensory neuroscience. It will also improve our understanding of animal behavior by clarifying how living systems interact with natural and artificial magnetic fields. More specifically, this research will determine the subcellular location and nature of magnetic particles in the nematode C. elegans by identifying the molecules that allow worms to detect and orient to magnetic force fields. Further, it will elucidate how the nervous system processes magnetic information. The project will support the training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as ongoing outreach efforts to increase science literacy among at risk children. Specifically, high school students will be trained through an ongoing summer science ""boot camp"" program and by recruiting local high school students to volunteer in the lab. They will learn how to generate hypotheses, perform experiments to test them, analyze and communicate their findings. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be given the opportunity to participate directly in the project, thereby gaining a complete scientific research experience. Graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in two biotechnology laboratory courses will also benefit by learning modern molecular techniques in the context of ongoing scientific research. All participating students will learn basic scientific literacy with the goal of presenting abstracts at meetings and co-authoring scientific publications based upon their research. <br/><br/>The production of a behavior relies on the interaction between the sensory, integrating, and motor systems in an individual. While much is known about the transduction of most sensory modalities, how animals detect and orient to the earth's magnetic field remains one of the final frontiers of sensory neuroscience. Recently, the principal investigator identified neurons that process magnetic information, identifying candidate mechanisms for magnetic sensation, and, importantly, the first magnetosensitive neurons in any animal. This project will determine the cellular localization of magnetic particles in the tissues of C. elegans by purifying these particles in animals with fluorescently labelled candidate cells, or labelling them immunohistochemically. The size and composition of these particles will be determined using TEM and SEM-EDX analysis. Atomic force microscopy will be used to measure their magnetic moment and subcellular localization. To determine which proteins are responsible for assembling magnetic particles near the magnetosensory neurons, RNA interference will be used to silence iron-related gene expression. The magnetotactic response of these animals will then be evaluated, and the localization of magnetic particles evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Candidate proteins will be tagged using PCR-fusion. Previous mass spectrometry analysis of magnetic particles isolated from the tissues of C. elegans revealed them enriched for the mechanoreceptor PEZO-1 and several proteins involved in touch transduction in other animals. RNA interference will be used to silence candidate proteins involved in magnetic transduction and record the resulting changes in magnetic responses in the magnetosensory neurons using the calcium indicator GCaMP6. Sufficiency will be tested by means of cell-specific, ORF-mediated, rescue of candidate genes. Subcellular localization of these proteins will be accomplished through PCR-fusion to fluorescently tag them. To identify how C. elegans encodes magnetic fields, GCaMP6 will be expressed in sensory and downstream neurons. Neuronal responses will be recorded in animals exposed to magnetic fields of varying directions and amplitudes. Completion of this project will reveal how magnetic particles are assembled and contribute to the detection of magnetic fields by C. elegans. The resolution of the magnetic transduction machinery, and the neuronal basis of magnetic field coding will likely reveal conserved molecular and cellular strategies for harnessing the earth's magnetic field in the production of adaptive behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glasgow)<br/><br/> The ultimate goal of the project is to understand how leaf physiology can be controlled to improve plant yield during drought.  Stomata are pores on plant leaves whose regulation balances the demand for carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis against excessive water loss through transpiration. A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating stomatal aperture could result in enhanced function, potentially leading to improved crop yields under drought and other environmental stresses.  Research under this collaborative project will provide training for postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students in diverse experimental and computational techniques and approaches at the University of North Carolina and University of Minnesota in the U.S. and the University of Glasgow in the U.K. Together with high school teachers, the researchers will also design and implement lesson plans for high school students on stomatal aperture and its relationship to plant water use and drought tolerance.  <br/><br/> Stomatal movements are critical for optimizing plant growth, and for adapting to changing environmental conditions including water availability, temperature, light, and CO2 levels.  Stomatal opening and closing occur through changes in the turgor and shape of guard cells that flank each stomatal pore, which requires regulated movement of solutes and water across the plasma membrane and the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane).  Mechanisms by which transporter activities are coordinated over the diurnal cycle and in variable environments are incompletely understood.  The project will exploit two recent advances to elucidate stomatal aperture control.  First, SAUR (Small Auxin Up RNA) proteins can promote stomatal opening, in part by regulating PP2C.D phosphatases that target membrane transporters.  Second, computational models developed by the researchers enable simulations of guard cell physiology that can predict and explain effects of altered SAUR or PP2C.D regulation.  A multidisciplinary approach including genetics, biochemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling will be used to determine mechanisms by which SAUR and PP2C.D proteins regulate stomatal aperture, whether different members of these families have different activities, and at what times and under what physiological conditions they act.  The combined experimental and modeling approach will lead to understanding of novel mechanisms that regulate stomatal movements and integrate them into existing models of guard cell regulation.  Such insights may suggest synthetic biology approaches to modify stomatal aperture or the kinetics of stomatal responses in crop plants, and enhance predictive models for the effects of environmental change on plant productivity.  <br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

Bacteria and archaea can adhere to surfaces using long, ""sticky"" filaments that protrude from their cell membranes called type IV pili (T4P). These filaments, which are made of thousands of copies of a protein called pilin, are incredibly strong, yet simultaneously extremely flexible. For example, a single bacterial T4P filament can support up to 10,000 times a bacterium's body weight, and T4P can be stretched to three times their original length without breaking. This project will use a computational approach known as molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the structure and dynamics of T4P filaments. Using this computational approach, simulated forces will be applied to T4P filaments to probe how they respond to being stretched, which will allow the identification of interactions that provide T4P with their great strength. The insights about T4P that will result from this work will inform applications in bionanotechnology, the role that T4P play in bacterial adhesion and motion, and will expand our general knowledge about protein filaments. Furthermore, this project will provide significant training to undergraduate students in a highly cross-disciplinary area of research at the interface of biology, physics, chemistry, and computer science. It will also develop computational learning modules and incorporate them into the undergraduate science curriculum to train students in the computational methods that are increasingly important in all scientific fields.<br/><br/>This project uses a computation/theory-led approach to: (1) investigate the dynamics of T4P filaments from three organisms, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, and P. aeruginosa, at the all-atom level of resolution using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, and (2) develop coarse-grained models to study the structural properties of T4P filaments, including the structural transition that occurs for T4P under external force. This comprehensive, multi scale computational approach will provide insights into the strength and dynamics of T4P across multiple length and time scales relevant to T4P function, and importantly will bridge the gap in knowledge that currently exists between the experimental and theoretical understanding of the biomechanics of T4P filaments. Specifically, all-atom simulations will be used to characterize T4P structural heterogeneity and to identify the most important interactions between pilin subunits for maintaining T4P structural integrity in the initial stages of the polymorphic transition that T4P exhibit under the application of external force. External forces will be applied to T4P using steered molecular dynamics protocols. Additionally, all-atom and coarse-grained simulations will be used in combination to determine important T4P filament properties such as the Young's modulus, persistence length, and torsional rigidity. Finally, coarse-grained simulations of T4P filaments under force will allow for the development of the first model of the fully force-transitioned state of a T4P filament, providing unprecedented molecular-scale insights into how the filament changes shape at the molecular scale. The coarse-grained T4P model developed in this project will act as a starting model for bridging from the atomistic scale to the scale of cellular biology. This project will provide novel insights into T4P biomechanics, aid in the fundamental understanding of the role of T4P in prokaryotes, and improve understanding of the plasticity of helical biopolymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glasgow)<br/><br/> The ultimate goal of the project is to understand how leaf physiology can be controlled to improve plant yield during drought.  Stomata are pores on plant leaves whose regulation balances the demand for carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis against excessive water loss through transpiration. A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating stomatal aperture could result in enhanced function, potentially leading to improved crop yields under drought and other environmental stresses.  Research under this collaborative project will provide training for postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students in diverse experimental and computational techniques and approaches at the University of North Carolina and University of Minnesota in the U.S. and the University of Glasgow in the U.K. Together with high school teachers, the researchers will also design and implement lesson plans for high school students on stomatal aperture and its relationship to plant water use and drought tolerance.  <br/> Stomatal movements are critical for optimizing plant growth, and for adapting to changing environmental conditions including water availability, temperature, light, and CO2 levels.  Stomatal opening and closing occur through changes in the turgor and shape of guard cells that flank each stomatal pore, which requires regulated movement of solutes and water across the plasma membrane and the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane).  Mechanisms by which transporter activities are coordinated over the diurnal cycle and in variable environments are incompletely understood.  The project will exploit two recent advances to elucidate stomatal aperture control.  First, SAUR (Small Auxin Up RNA) proteins can promote stomatal opening, in part by regulating PP2C.D phosphatases that target membrane transporters.  Second, computational models developed by the researchers enable simulations of guard cell physiology that can predict and explain effects of altered SAUR or PP2C.D regulation.  A multidisciplinary approach including genetics, biochemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling will be used to determine mechanisms by which SAUR and PP2C.D proteins regulate stomatal aperture, whether different members of these families have different activities, and at what times and under what physiological conditions they act.  The combined experimental and modeling approach will lead to understanding of novel mechanisms that regulate stomatal movements and integrate them into existing models of guard cell regulation.  Such insights may suggest synthetic biology approaches to modify stomatal aperture or the kinetics of stomatal responses in crop plants, and enhance predictive models for the effects of environmental change on plant productivity.  <br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

The aim of this project is to understand how the activity of USP7 is regulated and how it recognizes its diverse targets. To fill a critical gap in knowledge of USP7 function, an interdisciplinary approach will be employed that combines solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, cryo-Electron Microscopy, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), a variety of biophysical and biochemical methods, and a range of in vitro and in vivo assays.

USP7 exemplifies a newly recognized subgroup of deubiquitinating enzymes that is characterized by the presence of multiple ubiquitin-like domains (UBLs). These UBL domains are not catalytically active, but can greatly influence the activity of the enzyme by a yet unknown mechanism. The mechanisms of USP7 activation will be addressed by determining the arrangement of individual USP7 domains within the full-length enzyme.

The folding code is of fundamental importance and has clear practical value for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Solving the folding code will ultimately allow reliable design of proteins with a desired structure and function. A primary barrier to cracking the folding code is that the code is highly redundant. Two amino acid sequences with little resemblance can yield proteins with similar three-dimensional shapes. This project will test the hypothesis that short segments of a protein?s amino acid sequence act like punctuation marks that bias the protein chain to change direction. Placing these punctuation marks in the right places is thus sufficient to establish a protein?s shape.

The project will employ NMR and fluorescence methods, a thermodynamic approach involving formation of histidine-heme loops and computer simulations to test this hypothesis. The research will also test whether protein shape can be evolved by inserting turn sequences into a 42 residue polyalanine sequence known to form a single long &#945;-helix. Finally, the research will test whether protein structure can be devolved by replacing turn sequences with polyalanine segments.

Understanding association processes will increase fundamental understanding of protein-ligand binding and its applications. Along with binding, molecule's kinetic behavior - how they move - also plays a crucial role in understanding how rapidly they interact, undergo change, and bind with one another. Traditional approaches in protein binding and enzymology typically focus on a final chemical-protein structure, instead of the kinetic and binding processes that precede that final stage. Yet, exploring binding processes deepens our understanding of how molecules recognize binding partners, and will guide molecular designs and engineering of enzymes for more efficient chemical catalysis. Simulations have provided powerful tools to study molecular associations. However, real molecular systems are quite complicated, and these tools are usually either very time consuming or tend to over-simplify a biological system. This project will combine multi-level coarse-grained and atomistic simulations to efficiently and accurately model molecular associations and kinetic enhancement of the enzymes and nanoparticle systems. Reliable and efficient molecular simulations play an ever-increasing role in studying binding kinetics. They provide unique insights into the mechanisms of biomolecular activity, an in the integration and interpretation of experiments. In addition, understanding binding kinetics contributes to the design of novel molecules and engineering enzymes and enzyme complexes for more efficient chemical activity. Successful completion of this research will improve understanding of protein-ligand binding kinetics and assist the design of nanostructures, nanoparticles and engineered enzymes.<br/><br/>This project will train young scientists, including graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.

Although there is more than enough energy in sunlight to meet this challenge, efficient means to concentrate this diffuse solar energy and store it have not yet been developed.

However, photosynthesis is inherently an inefficient process; it is limited not by the availability of light from the sun but by the rate of the first step in the chemical reactions by which carbon dioxide is converted into products that are rich in energy. There is therefore unused capacity for the capture and use of solar energy by natural photosynthesis.

The international and interdisciplinary nature of the project will build bridges between the US and UK scientific communities in a range of important scientific areas including synthetic biology, photosynthetic physiology, catalysis, and metabolic regulation.

While it has been understood for decades that endocytosis enables cells to degrade or recycle receptors, the question of how endocytosis ultimately impacts downstream signal propagation remains wide open. For example, even for the highly studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) the literature contains highly cited, yet conflicting reports that conclude that EGFR endocytosis either promotes or impedes downstream signaling through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In this project, the investigators will explore the hypothesis that the intrinsic complexity of the spatiotemporal signaling regulatory mechanisms creates parameter spaces for both answers to be true depending on the cellular context. The complexity of the receptor trafficking and signaling system cannot be fully dissected, however, without integrating quantitative experimental measurements that faithfully reflect cell biology with spatiotemporal computational models. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to combine novel live-cell imaging of gene-edited cell systems with mechanistic models that capture system complexity with unprecedented detail to resolve the kinds of conflicting reports previously mentioned, as well as more recent surprising observations that certain proteins conventionally thought to remain in complex during signal transduction may become physically separated through trafficking processes. Ultimately, the proposed integration of gene-edited cell systems, quantitative live-cell imaging and biochemical measurements, and a spatiotemporal computational model will lead to an entirely new quantitative platform to answer these kinds of questions for EGFR and other receptor signaling systems."

These education and outreach activities involve innovation upon existing programs at the partnering institutions as well as the creation of new outreach efforts that will target larger audiences, such as a summer academy of science for high school students and a collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, FL to develop a live interaction program on cell signaling.<br/> <br/>The biochemical signaling that results upon ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases is accompanied by receptor clustering and internalization, or endocytosis. While it has been understood for decades that endocytosis enables cells to degrade or recycle receptors, the question of how endocytosis ultimately impacts downstream signal propagation remains wide open. For example, even for the highly studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) the literature contains highly cited, yet conflicting reports that conclude that EGFR endocytosis either promotes or impedes downstream signaling through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In this project, the investigators will explore the hypothesis that the intrinsic complexity of the spatiotemporal signaling regulatory mechanisms creates parameter spaces for both answers to be true depending on the cellular context. The complexity of the receptor trafficking and signaling system cannot be fully dissected, however, without integrating quantitative experimental measurements that faithfully reflect cell biology with spatiotemporal computational models. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to combine novel live-cell imaging of gene-edited cell systems with mechanistic models that capture system complexity with unprecedented detail to resolve the kinds of conflicting reports previously mentioned, as well as more recent surprising observations that certain proteins conventionally thought to remain in complex during signal transduction may become physically separated through trafficking processes. Ultimately, the proposed integration of gene-edited cell systems, quantitative live-cell imaging and biochemical measurements, and a spatiotemporal computational model will lead to an entirely new quantitative platform to answer these kinds of questions for EGFR and other receptor signaling systems."

The goal of the project is to understand how these proteins generate motion to perform cellular work. This project will utilize a 'metal-rescue' technology for controlling and modulating the activity of the motor protein by varying the ratio of metal ions that are necessary components for the proteins. This innovative technology will be useful for researchers to reversibly control the activity of multiple different enzymes.

Underrepresented minorities at the high school level will be educated and trained in STEM research.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to define the nucleotide hydrolysis mechanisms of unconventional kinesin and myosin motor proteins using biochemical, structural, biophysical, and advanced mathematical analysis. Myosin and kinesin superfamily motors are cytoskeletal filament-stimulated ATPases that share structural motifs in their active sites which directly interact with the nucleotide and divalent metal cofactor, typically Mg(II). A 'metal-rescue' strategy will be used to control the enzymatic activity and motility of kinesins and myosins and by taking advantage of the differential affinities of Mg(II) and Mn(II) for serine or cysteine residues. Specifically, manipulation of the protein-metal interaction will provide a direct and experimentally reversible strategy to modulate switch-1 closure and, thus, motor motility upon its filament. The ATPase mechanism of wild type and the metal-rescue mutant kinesin-5 motors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be defined and the allosteric mechanochemistry of the wild type and metal-rescue mutant of myosin-II motors from Dictyostelium discoideum will be determined.

In contrast, in this study an ancient, deep branching lineage of eukaryotes, kinetoplastid protists will be examined. The organism of choice, Trypanosoma brucei, has telomerase with unique structural and functional properties, and result should indicate how this enzyme works. The project will encourage full participation from women and underrepresented minorities in science.

Telomerase has two core components, the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) that catalyzes telomere elongation, and the telomerase RNA (TER), which provides a template for telomere DNA synthesis. The mechanisms of telomere elongation by telomerase are poorly understood in Trypanosoma brucei, a deep branching Kinetoplastid. Therefore, this project dissects structural, biochemical and genetic features of telomerase RNA in T. brucei to understand the mechanism of telomerase regulation in early eukaryotic species. The recent discovery of the T. brucei TER reveals novel features exclusive to deep branching eukaryotes, suggesting mechanistic differences in the process of telomere synthesis between T. brucei and higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, this project: (i) investigates telomerase RNA structure at a single nucleotide resolution using NMR and SHAPE chemistry, (ii) defines key TERT contact sites on TER that are essential for telomerase function in T. brucei using HITS-CLIP technology, and (iii) establishes the functional significance of TR domains by genetic manipulations and telomerase functional assays.

The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes need to be protected against inappropriate DNA damage repair reactions (DDR), DNA degradation and incomplete DNA replication in order to maintain genomic stability and proper functioning. The solution to these challenges is to form a protective telomere cap structure that consists of specialized repeat DNA sequences and associated factors that together form the shelterin complex. Gradual shortening of telomeres in dividing cells triggers DDR and cell cycle arrest. Thus telomeres are referred to as internal biological clocks that determine the proliferative lifespan of an organism and function as major anticancer barriers. Detailed knowledge of how telomeres form a protective cap at the chromosome end and how progressive telomere shortening leads to replicative senescence is needed to better understand aging and cancer.

The changes in organization of telomeric chromatin will be determined as telomeres shorten in dividing cells to understand the mechanism that triggers DDR accumulation at chromosome ends before senescence. Additionally, to determine whether compaction of telomeric tracts is required and sufficient to antagonize binding of DDR proteins to telomeric overhangs, the structure of shelterin-bound telomeric DNA will be solved using cryoelectron tomography and its structure-function properties will be investigated by single molecule experiments in vitro."

Cyanobacteria and some land plants have mechanisms that concentrate carbon dioxide near the enzyme Rubisco that prevents it from reacting with oxygen, a process called carbon concentrating mechanism.  However, many of the globally important crop plants lack this ability. In this collaborative project investigators from the US (Cornell University) and the UK (Lancaster University and Glasgow University) seek to use newly developed synthetic biology tools to create a carbon concentrating system in a plant that lacks this capability. The project provides interdisciplinary training opportunities, including with their international collaborators, in quantitative and synthetic biology.   <br/><br/>One strategy to improve photosynthetic yields is to replace a crop plant's Rubisco with a faster enzyme along with a carbon-concentrating mechanism.

Biochemical and microscopic studies will be performed to determine the effect of stoichiometry of cyanobacterial proteins on microcompartment size, morphology, and function in carbon concentration and photosynthesis.

Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to combine novel live-cell imaging of gene-edited cell systems with mechanistic models that capture system complexity with unprecedented detail to resolve the kinds of conflicting reports previously mentioned, as well as more recent surprising observations that certain proteins conventionally thought to remain in complex during signal transduction may become physically separated through trafficking processes. Ultimately, the proposed integration of gene-edited cell systems, quantitative live-cell imaging and biochemical measurements, and a spatiotemporal computational model will lead to an entirely new quantitative platform to answer these kinds of questions for EGFR and other receptor signaling systems."

The investigators on this project will also make yearly presentations to all participants in the Biotechnology Program at Southwest to expose all students in the program, many of whom are from underprivileged backgrounds, to career options in the STEM fields. The results generated from these studies will be broadly disseminated and developed as a tool that teachers can access to illustrate to undergraduate students the diversity of cell division processes utilized by members of the bacterial kingdom.<br/><br/>Bacteria of the genus Chlamydia divide by a novel process termed polarized budding, as do a subset of the other members of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobiae-Chlamydiae superphylum of bacteria. The bacteria that undergo polarized budding do not express the protein FtsZ, which is critical for the process of binary fission that the vast majority of bacteria use as a mechanism for cell division.  The regulatory events that control cell division in FtsZ-less bacteria are not understood, and the studies in this research project will define underlying molecular mechanisms that govern polarized budding.  Specifically, the project will define the role of phospholipids in generating changes in membrane curvature that arise in Chlamydia during cell division.  The research will also determine the role of phospholipids in regulating the localization of membrane and cytosolic proteins in cells undergoing polarized budding.  The project will bring together researchers from multiple institutions with distinct and complementary expertise to define molecular mechanisms that regulate discrete steps in the polarized budding process that Chlamydia use to divide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize surface components. During endocytosis, a portion of the plasma membrane is pulled into the inside of the cell forming a small, spherical structure known as an endocytic vesicle. This research will investigate the cellular machinery that carries out endocytosis and how it is regulated. This project will support diversity in science and education through training of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom belong to groups underrepresented in the sciences. Both undergraduate and graduate students in this project will be involved in taking hands-on yeast research, concepts in cellular compartments, and fluorescence microscopy into middle school classrooms. In addition, knowledge gained through this research will be integrated in undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This research will explore fundamental and outstanding questions in endocytosis. Aim 1 will tackle one of the ongoing problems in the field: is there an endocytic checkpoint and if so how is it regulated? It will test the hypothesis that binding of integral membrane protein cargo by components of the machinery is a central event in the assembly of the endocytic machinery and address a controversy regarding the function of a scaffolding protein called clathrin in membrane bending at endocytic sites. Aims 2 and 3 will explore the activity of two new regulators of the endocytic machinery recently discovered by this laboratory. Aim 2 will investigate the concept that one of the new endocytic proteins regulates the actin cytoskeleton, which provides force to pull the vesicle into the cell. Aim 3 will test the idea that the second new protein regulates dynamics of the endocytic machinery through ubiquitination-deubiquitination, an important but poorly understood posttranslational modification of endocytic proteins. Additional candidate new proteins of the endocytic machinery will be systematically tested to verify if they indeed work in endocytosis and to understand how they work. The powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system will allow for the study of endocytosis regulators both in vivo and in vitro.

Although there is more than enough energy in sunlight to meet this challenge, efficient means to concentrate this diffuse solar energy and store it have not yet been developed. Photosynthesis is the biological process by which green plants and some microorganisms capture and store solar energy; they use it to convert carbon dioxide to metabolic fuels. However, photosynthesis is inherently an inefficient process; it is limited not by the availability of light from the sun but by the rate of the first step in the chemical reactions by which carbon dioxide is converted into products that are rich in energy. There is therefore unused capacity for the capture and use of solar energy by natural photosynthesis. This program engages teams of researchers from the US and the United Kingdom with the goal to re-invent photosynthesis with enhanced efficiency thereby improving the capacity of photosynthetic organisms to make renewable fuels and enhance food security. In the course of the scientific research, this project will provide research training opportunities for more than 14 people (including both women and underrepresented minorities) at the post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels. The international and interdisciplinary nature of the project will build bridges between the US and UK scientific communities in a range of important scientific areas including synthetic biology, photosynthetic physiology, catalysis, and metabolic regulation. The researchers will engage and inform both the public and other investigators through activities that include peer-reviewed publications, public science lectures, blogs, websites, and popular science articles. <br/><br/>To dramatically enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis, this project will develop a range of mechanisms to electrically connect light-activated electron flow from the photosynthetic reaction center  (PSI) to downstream fuel-production pathways. This will include increasing flux through natural pathways, creating electrical connections between distinct microbial cell types by construction of artificial biological nanowires, and employing a soluble, chemical, redox shuttle to transfer reducing equivalents from a light harvesting cell to different fuel-producing cells. These scientific goals will be accomplished  through four parallel specific aims. 1. Characterization of the components of (and mechanism for controlling flux through) the natural extracellular electron transfer pathway of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. 2. Construction of artificial systems to  abstract reducing equivalents from PSI; these will compete with natural electron acceptors only under highly reducing conditions. 3. Development of artificial means to move reducing equivalents out of the cytoplasm of Synechocystis. 4. Construction within microbes of artificial fuel-production modules that require only reducing equivalents and carbon dioxide as inputs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs widely believed to function primarily in repressing the translation of protein coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through complementary basepairing. While novel miRNA discovery has led to the identification of over 24,000 of these ~20 nucleotide RNAs over the last decade, progress in deciphering what genes individual miRNAs are regulating has proven exceptionally challenging largely due to miRNAs requiring very little sequence complementarity to the mRNAs they coordinate. In contrast to short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which depend upon almost perfect complementarity to direct message degradation, miRNA target recognition and consequent repression can be mediated through as few as 7 base pairs. This CAREER project will characterize several novel caveats to accurate miRNA targeting including: 1) a subset of miRNAs whose targets cannot be identified by examining genomic sequence as they regulate edited RNAs in the transcriptome, 2) a subset of miRNAs whose targets cannot be identified by screening mRNA sequences as these miRNAs were originally formed from, and therefore likely regulate, other noncoding RNAs, and 3) a subset of miRNAs initially formed from transposable elements, which leads them to target mRNAs containing related transposable element sequences. This research will fill in major gaps in our knowledge of miRNA function and significantly clarify and potentially transform miRNA target prediction through improving the parameters widely utilized by thousands of miRNA research scientists currently using internet-based target prediction programs to generate hypotheses and design experimental strategies. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS. The proposed CAREER research activities are intimately intertwined with an extensive educational framework incorporating high school, undergraduate and graduate students. In the classroom, education and research will be integrated through a novel computational genomics course, recently developed by PI Borchert, which will directly utilize undergraduates to execute the computational analyses outlined here. Utilizing a project-based learning strategy, this course equips students with a novel informatics tool set and teaches them how to work independently and in small groups to complete a class-wide research analysis. Significantly, in its first two semesters, this pilot course has generated 35 student authorships on peer-reviewed articles. Additional impacts accompanying the adoption of this course include the development of departmental infrastructure for research and education through the enhancement of computer lab facilities, presentations at professional meetings on incorporating research into the undergraduate classroom, and disseminating class informatics training exercises and guidelines for instructors on how to implement similar project based learning strategies on the course website. In the laboratory, education and research will be integrated through mentoring high school, undergraduate and graduate students in hypothesis-driven research projects at the interface of biology and computer science. While undergraduate and graduate researchers will be primarily charged with executing the experimentation outlined here, the Borchert laboratory will also offer summer internships to promising local high school students for the duration of this award. While there are several outstanding high schools in the Mobile area, there are also several struggling, predominately African-American inner city schools that will be directly targeted for the recruitment of interested, talented summer interns. Importantly, at least one position will be reserved for a local minority student each summer helping to expose these students to role models in the biological sciences. These efforts are intended to increase successful completion of BS degrees, increase pursuit of graduate education, and increase freshman enrollment in biology by members of underrepresented groups.<br/>"

Polarized plant cell growth is a highly focused type of growth essential for land colonization, sexual reproduction, and water and nutrient uptake. A central player in the regulation of polarized cell growth is the actin cytoskeleton, an evolutionarily conserved assembly of dynamic nano-polymers (actin filaments) and nano-motors (myosins). The actin cytoskeleton is known to participate in the organization of components inside the cell, including endomembranes and secretory vesicles containing materials important for cell growth. The long-term goal of the research is to understand how the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane compartments interact to generate polarized plant cell growth. Toward accomplishing this goal, the objective of the project is to determine the role of the motor myosin XI in the coordination between actin filaments, endomembranes, and polarized secretion of growth materials. The central hypothesis is that membrane compartments, such as secretory vesicles, function as active centers of organization where actin polymerization and myosin XI-based transport cooperate to produce polarized secretion. The following three specific aims are designed to test the central hypothesis using the moss Physcomitrella patens as a plant model system: 1) identify the membrane compartments associated with myosin XI;  2) identify the receptors that anchor myosin XI to its membrane cargo; and  3) determine how myosin XI, actin polymerization, and endomembranes cooperate to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during polarized cell growth. The project will investigate a novel mechanism for polarized secretion based on the cooperation of myosin XI and actin polymerization using unique genetic tools developed to reduce overall myosin XI activity or only its cargo binding activity. The research provides a viable model for cell polarization driven by the concerted action of endomembrane compartments, myosin XI, and a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. In addition to contributing to the basic understanding of biology, the knowledge obtained from this project has the potential to identify strategies to improve plant reproduction, plant fitness, and plant growth. These improvements can impact agricultural science by promoting the development of plants with characteristics necessary for a more sustainable future. From an educational perspective, the project impacts the rapidly advancing field of biology where there is an increasing need for microscopy and imaging education and training. In order to integrate these disciplines within the general biology curriculum, a new microscopy and imaging course will be implemented. The goal of the laboratory and inquiry-based course is to train students to apply microscopy in research both in class and as part of independent research projects. The new course will have a modular format that allows the use of some of its parts for outreach programs.  The project also provides opportunities for improving presentation and networking skills during the postdoctoral experience through the continued development of a social networking tool (LectureBank.org) for postdoctoral scholars with an emphasis on underrepresented minority life scientists.  The tool serves as a peer-to-peer mentoring resource and provides a forum for sharing materials and experiences."

A great deal is known about how cells remove and replace cytoskeletal pieces.  However, a fundamental challenge for the cell is how to recycle the disassembled pieces.  A goal of this project is to understand how cells move the newly disassembled parts to new places where they need to be fast enough to change shape in response to external signals.  This work will reveal how cells are able to pull themselves apart, move the disassembled pieces to the right place, and put themselves back together every time they move.  The work is important because it will reveal basic principals of dynamic reorganization of the entire cell interior.  Understanding these principals is essential to learning how to coordinate cytoskeletal remodeling, knowledge that is critical for a variety of applications. Broader Impact activities will include outreach to a local science museum along with helping to build a quantitative biology community in the northwest.<br/><br/>Dynamic control of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to processes such as motility, division, and polarization. Although decades of research have defined the mechanisms that control the addition of monomers at the front of the cell and removal of monomers at the back, how the cell transports monomer from the back of the network, where it is removed, to the front of the network, where it is added is unknown.  This transport process is essential to cell homeostasis, and it is tacitly assumed to be diffusion because it is fast and difficult to measure.  The PIs have for the first time directly measured forward monomer transport.  From their measurements it is clear that forward monomer transport is faster than diffusion and dependent upon myosin II contraction. The objectives of this study are to identify the mechanism that makes forward transport of actin faster than diffusion and to define the role of myosin II contraction in driving and directing forward transport to remodel the cytoskeleton.  These objectives will be achieved by combining biophysical assays, molecular biology, photonics, single molecule imaging, and mathematical/mass transport analysis.  This project is expected to identify long-distance transport mechanisms where diffusion is too slow and direct motor coupling is unlikely because of rapid spatial and temporal changes of the intended transport destination."

Two examples are the many microbes associated with the human body (e.g., gut microbiome) and species that contribute to soil fertility and plant health. These natural microbial consortia that contain many different species, are often composed of poorly-characterized microbes. They also have complicated signaling networks of compounds and metabolites that are exchanged between community members. The complexity of natural consortia makes them difficult to study and can obscure identification of common principles that underlie many different communities. Consequently, many fundamental questions remain about how microbial consortia are organized to maintain productivity and resilience in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

The research also provides insight into the evolution of natural microbial symbioses. Through this project two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow are trained. In addition, there are multiple undergraduate research experience opportunities. The project also involves promoting the development of public forums for the discussion of potential benefits and ethical concerns of bioengineering. These forums are hosted in the Michigan Science Center in Detroit.<br/><br/>The research team is using a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) that produces and secretes large quantities of sucrose from light and CO2. The PI has demonstrated that a variety of other microbes can be cultivated in the same media in a ""modular"" fashion. In these circumstances the co-cultured partner consumes the sucrose produced by the cyanobacteria. The flexibility in the design of these artificial microbial communities allows different heterotrophic bacteria to be cultivated with the cyanobacterium. In this way, common themes and mechanisms of interaction between the co-cultured species are identified. Approaches that include rational engineering, forward genetics, directed evolution, metabolic modeling, and individual-based simulations are used to identify the metabolites and signals exchanged between species. These approaches are also used to determine how metabolite exchanges contribute to consortia robustness. The knowledge gained is used to rationally design microbial communities that are more robust in the face of environmental pressures, such as invasion by ""non-cooperating"" microbial species. It is anticipated that the research efforts from this proposal will provide insights into fundamental interactions underpinning natural microbial symbioses, with translational impacts for the development of environmentally-sustainable cyanobacterial biotechnologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The consequences of failure are especially high in heterochromatin, the which mostly consists of highly compact DNA-protein structures and repeated DNA sequences. While repair failures in normal chromatin can lead to deleterious mutations, incorrect repair within repetitive heterochromatic regions can trigger rearrangements that cause cell death or genome instability. This project will use new experimental approaches and methods in the fruit fly to understand heterochromatic repair pathways at the chromatin level. This work will yield fundamental advances in our understanding of the role of chromatin modifications on genome integrity, and the project itself creates excellent educational opportunities for junior researchers to participate in training, teaching, mentoring and outreach activities, launching their careers in science while inspiring others. Specific attention for inclusion of undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented groups will expose more women and low-income students to STEM fields. These research and educational activities will increase their career opportunities while diversifying the pipeline of future scientists and broadening perspectives to solve future societal challenges. This project will also involve organizing a ""SoCal Genome Stability"" symposium that will enhance the dissemination of knowledge, open new networking, research and career opportunities for junior and senior scientists at colleges and universities across Southern California. <br/><br/>Nearly 30% of the human genome comprises pericentromeric heterochromatin, where defective repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) can lead to widespread genome rearrangements. Previous studies revealed specialized mechanisms required for 'safe' homologous recombination (HR) repair of these sequences, including a poorly understood role for histone marks. This study will shed light on the role of chromatin composition and regulation in heterochromatin repair in Drosophila. It will combine the unique strengths of the Drosophila model system, with innovative tools for site-specific DSB induction and next-generation sequencing. This combination of approaches will enable the first high-resolution profiling of chromatin dynamics responsible for heterochromatic repair, significantly advancing the understanding of genome stability mechanisms in multi-cellular eukaryotes."

A major limitation to advancing our knowledge of how plants respond to and tolerate stress is understanding the movement and distribution of short-lived and highly reactive plant signaling molecules both within and between cells. The project aims to study how plant cells communicate types of environmental stresses through key signaling and chemically reactive molecules of oxygen (ROS). Current approaches to monitor and manipulate ROS are based on biotechnology tools limited to a few plant model systems lacking the temporal resolution to sense rapid or long-term changes in ROS in specific subcellular compartments. The study will utilize emerging nanobiotechnology approaches for discovering novel mechanisms of plant ROS communication mediated by specialized cellular structures such as chloroplasts. Synthetic and versatile nanoparticle-based tools have the potential to be easily translated from plant model systems to diverse plant species. The project will disseminate the results at meetings to scientists across multiple disciplines of plant biology and engineering and at local public science outreach events. A new generation of undergraduate and graduate students from diverse departments and underrepresented groups will be trained in the laboratory on plant biology research and engineering with nanomaterials and in the classroom through a nanobiotechnology course. <br/><br/>ROS are key signaling molecules communicating and regulating fine-tuned plant stress responses. The mechanisms involved in plant ROS communication between the plant apoplast and chloroplasts are crucial to control the expression of abiotic stress gene clusters. It has been proposed that abiotic stresses induce ROS apoplastic waves that are transmitted to chloroplasts where they trigger a secondary increase in ROS generation. It is unclear if chloroplasts act as transceivers both receiving and transmitting ROS waves generated in the apoplast. The proposed project will apply novel ROS monitoring and manipulating nanoparticles to gain a mechanistic understanding of the hypothesized role of chloroplasts as receivers, amplifiers, generators, and modulators of ROS oscillatory waves during abiotic stress. It will test and model the idea that the amplitude, duration, and phase of subcellular ROS waves in leaf epidermal cells are uniquely associated with high light, heat, and ozone stress responses. Single walled carbon nanotubes will be used as in vivo ROS sensors. These infinite lifetime nanosensors fluoresce in the near infrared where living tissues are relatively transparent. They do not photobleach and have the potential for millisecond temporal resolution and single molecule detection. Cerium oxide nanoparticles that can act as catalytic ROS scavengers will be targeted to the apoplast and chloroplasts for specific ROS manipulation in these subcellular compartments. The study will demonstrate proof of concept of unique nanobiotechnology approaches to study plant signaling communication in vivo with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution and contribute to our understanding of how subcellular ROS signals encode source specific signals regulating plant abiotic stress responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crop yield depends critically on massive nitrogen fertilizer input. The annual production of 15 million tons of N-fertilizer needed currently consumes ~1% of the world's annual energy production. However, plants absorb only a fraction of the applied fertilizer and the rest leaches into the groundwater, pollutes the environment and damages drinking water supplies. Therefore, increased efficiency of nitrogen uptake and use by crop plants is desirable on a variety of levels. To promote this increase in efficiency, we need a better understanding of the cellular basis of N acquisition and distribution from roots to the rest of the plant. However, we do not understand exactly where, when and how roots acquire N or how they control uptake and distribution in the plant. A key impediment to this understanding is the lack of suitable technologies, with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, for monitoring N acquisition and its regulation. Dr. Frommer's lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science recently pioneered the engineering of novel tools that monitor the activity of key proteins responsible for moving nitrogen from the soil into the roots. This project will improve these new tools, implement them in plants, and use them to directly monitor N acquisition. The project will also integrate knowledge from this and other publicly available plant biology resources to generate a spatio-temporal map of N-acquisition in roots under different N regimes. This project will also train the next generation of scientists. Specifically, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students will be trained in engineering and implementation of activity probes with the goal of improving the ability of plant roots to acquire fertilizers, thus reducing fertilizer use. Undergraduate and high school students will work with experienced scientists to develop a series of databases providing information on fertilizers, nutrition, as well as molecular detail on how plants acquire N. These resources will be available to scientists and the public.<br/><br/>The Frommer lab recently succeeded in engineering the key transporters for N-acquisition from the reference plant Arabidopsis as fluorescent biosensors that have the potential to report transporter activity and thus regulation of N uptake and distribution with high temporal and spatial resolution. Major aims of this project are to: (1) Engineer and optimize the fluorescent activity sensors for ammonium, nitrate and oligopeptide transporters, gain insights into their mechanism and use them for structure-function analyses; (2) Deploy the fluorescent sensors to characterize regulatory proteins that interact with N transporters to gain insights into their regulation by making use of candidates identified in a novel resource, the MIND membrane protein interactome database; (3) Implement the sensors in wild type and mutant plants and measure transport activity in individual cells of intact roots using quantitative fluorescence imaging technology; (4) Engineer fluorescent sensors for nitrogen forms, i.e. nitrate, ammonium, glutamate, glutamine and dipeptides and deploy them in plants to monitor the dynamics of the different nitrogen forms in vivo; (5) Integrate novel information gained in this project with that from public resources to create a cellular resolution root map of nitrogen uptake and its regulation (to be built by students). The project makes use of cutting edge technologies (fluorescent sensors, quantitative imaging, microfluidic devices, cell specific expression resources) to obtain an integrated quantitative view of the mechanisms of N acquisition in roots.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the MCB Division and the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster in the IOS Division."

Starch from cereal crops and tubers account for 50-80% of daily caloric intake. In the U.S., 36% of corn is dedicated to animal feed and 34% is converted into biofuels. Starch is both a first-generation biofuel and a feedstock for molecular hydrogen and oil production by micro-algae. It is also an industrial feedstock for paper, textiles, adhesives, and plastics. Therefore, defining the pathways that control starch metabolism is needed in order to develop novel strategies that manipulate these pathways and satisfy the growing starch demand. This project will define molecular energy storage mechanisms from algae to plants while teaching students to test hypotheses using bioinformatics, biophysics, structural biology, cell biology, and enzymology. The broader impacts of this project may increase participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM, improve STEM education and educator development, help develop a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce, and increase public scientific literacy and engagement with science technology.<br/><br/>Reversible phosphorylation of starch glucose is the only known natural modification of starch, and it directly influences starch hydration, crystallinity, freeze-thaw stability, viscosity, and transparency, which are all central to industrial applications. Starch producing organisms possess either one or two glucan dikinases that phosphorylate starch glucose. Their activity is critical for the production and utilization of starch in vivo. Despite their key biological role, little is known regarding the physical and functional basis for glucan dikinase action. To define the biology and biochemistry of glucan dikinases, the researchers focus on green plants which possess two glucan dikinases. Further, there is currently no means to harness their unique activity. This research will develop methods to utilize glucan dikinases by focusing on algal systems that possess only one glucan dikinase. The project combines state-of-the-art biophysical approaches with biochemistry, cell biology, algal genetics, and glucan analysis to define the function, dynamics, structures, and regulation of glucan dikinases. The objectives of this research are to: (I) define the molecular enzymology of glucan dikinases, (II) determine structural dynamics and crystal structures of glucan dikinases, and (III) elucidate the biological function of algal glucan phosphorylation.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This protein reshuffling is referred to as protein trafficking and cells must make the correct 'decisions' to control protein trafficking and ensure optimal cell growth and survival. The goal of this research is to understand how the cellular decisions that dictate protein trafficking are made. This multidisciplinary project pairs cell and molecular biology with powerful new computational biology approaches to define the parameters that determine how proteins are selectively relocalized in response to environmental changes. Key players in regulating these cellular decisions are a recently described, but poorly understood, family of proteins called the alpha-arrestins. Alpha-arrestins act as cellular 'mail carriers' ensuring that proteins are delivered to the right location at the right time. In spite of their important role in protein trafficking, there remain critical, yet unanswered questions about alpha-arrestin function including: 1) how do alpha-arrestins recognize the discreet subset of proteins they regulate? and 2) what factors control when and where alpha-arrestins interact with the proteins they traffic? In other words, how do these molecular mail carriers know which letters to pick up, when to pick them up and where to deliver them? Understanding the answers to these questions is essential; defects in the trafficking decision making process have catastrophic consequences for the cell. The interdisciplinary nature of this research project ensures that trainees at all levels - including high school, undergraduate and graduate students - gain exposure to a wide-array of scientific approaches. The research objectives of this project will be integrated into an undergraduate laboratory course to ensure that undergraduate researchers get to experience the thrill of scientific discovery while learning science fundamentals. Undergraduate and high school student summer internships will also be created to allow students to contribute to advancing the boundary of knowledge in the dynamic field of protein trafficking. <br/><br/>The goal of the research is to define principles that govern selective protein trafficking using alpha-arrestins, an exciting new class of trafficking adaptor, as a model. The alpha-arrestins, conserved from yeast to humans and related to the well-characterized and clinically important mammalian beta-arrestins, are a recently described class of trafficking adaptor that play a critical role in selective protein trafficking. While we have yet to appreciate the breadth of alpha-arrestin function, in yeast they interact with the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to regulate the trafficking fate of cargo proteins. The alpha-arrestins are little studied and the experiments proposed here will define key posttranslational regulation of, and novel biological functions for, these critical regulators of protein trafficking. Specifically, this research will: 1) Define how disruption of the alpha-arrestin-Rsp5 interface impairs the ubiquitin ligase efficiency of Rsp5; 2) Determine how ubiquitination regulates alpha-arrestin-mediated trafficking and determine how Rsp5 activity is restricted to permit alpha-arrestin mono-ubiquitination; and 3) Comprehensively identify alpha-arrestin cargo proteins and define motifs that dictate alpha-arrestin-cargo interaction using a robust, new computational approach that employs evolutionary signatures to infer functional relationships. The results of this project will yield new paradigms for how trafficking adaptors are regulated, ubiquitin conjugation is restricted and selective cargo trafficking is achieved. Through the use of novel computational methods and complementary genetic and biochemical approaches, this research will establish the rules that govern trafficking adaptor function. Trafficking adaptors dictate cargo localization in all eukaryotes, thus the 'decision-making' rules identified from these experiments will provide vital information to researchers with diverse interests."

For this technology to be scalable and economically viable, engineered microbial hosts must be able to continuously balance the pathway metabolism to cope with high titer and high yield production. Dynamic metabolic regulation systems (DMRSs) are synthetic biological components that provide dynamic control to the concentration of pathway enzymes and metabolites (the chemicals on which enzymes act). This study will provide a systematic and quantitative understanding of how DMRSs change the dynamic behavior of metabolic pathways and how DMRSs improve pathway productivity. The knowledge will enable researchers to design metabolic control systems more easily, effectively, and reliably, improving productivities, yields and robustness for a variety of metabolic pathways and making the microbial production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and material more economically viable. This project will provide tools that are useful for studying the effect of dynamics on natural metabolic pathways, revealing the evolutionary significance of natural regulatory systems. These tools can be further extended to regulate a variety of complex synthetic systems, such as chemical-controlled, contaminant-cleaning microbes. This project will also provide educational and training opportunities for K-12 students and teachers from local public schools with a high percentage of underrepresented students through a series of activities including ""Hot Topic Workshops"" and ""Lab Research Experience"" These educational and training programs will promote students' interests in cutting-edge science and to develop basic skills for research in systems and synthetic biology. <br/><br/>Technical Description: Synthetic regulatory systems that provide dynamic control on metabolic pathways (referred to as DMRSs) are very powerful tools in microbial engineering for the production of chemicals from complex metabolic pathways. Previous proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that DMRSs were able to significantly enhance both pathway productivities and yields. However, due to the complex protein-metabolite/protein-DNA interactions, construction of effective DMRSs is challenging and often needs to test a large number of parameters and regulatory topologies (e.g. upregulation v.s. downregulation, long-range feedback vs. short-range feedback). For DMRSs to work robustly and to be applicable to a broad range of pathways, this project aims to develop a systematic understanding of metabolic dynamics and of how metabolic dynamics affects pathway productivities. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical strategies, including biosensor-enabled ensemble-fluorescence measurement, single cell imaging, chromatographic metabolite quantifications, and kinetic models, this project will systematically characterize metabolic dynamics, metabolic fluctuation, and cell-to-cell metabolic variation under various regulatory topologies."

It has become increasingly clear that chromatin-based processes are deeply tied to ancient metabolic activities.

The objectives for the research are to define chromatin-directed functions of a panel of newly identified metabolic enzymes with nuclear roles, using the strategies that the investigators have successfully developed. By probing long known but incompletely understood metabolic enzymes, the progress made in this research will be of fundamental significance defining proteins that have contributed to the molecular and cellular evolution of nuclear processes in the course of genomic evolution. Significantly, study of these enzymes will establish a framework defining the interplay between metabolism and chromatin functions that are critical for gene regulation, response to DNA damage, and maintenance of genome stability.

The presence of unpaired genes during this part of the cell cycle is often indicative of a foreign DNA element.  Accordingly, the cell usually benefits by silencing (turning off) the expression of these genes.  This pathway is called 'Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA (MSUD)' and is a unique RNA-based gene silencing system first described in the orange bread mold, Neurospora crassa.  But since DNA segments lacking a pairing partner are also targeted for silencing in worms, mice, and humans, the study of MSUD will shed light on how chromosome pairing affects gene regulation in higher organisms as well.  To broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, the investigators of this project will recruit and train undergraduate students from their own university as well as from non-Ph.D.-granting and minority-serving institutions.  Research activities from this project will be used to develop lesson plans for various outreach programs.  Efforts will also be made to promote interdisciplinary partnerships and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education.<br/> <br/>In various organisms, genome surveillance systems are maintained to control the expression of repetitive elements and limit their spreading.  One of these mechanisms is MSUD, which examines the pairing of any DNA segment with its homologous partner during meiotic prophase I.  A gene not paired with a similar sequence generates a silencing signal (a small RNA species), which subsequently turns off the expression from this unpaired DNA as well as from any other (paired or unpaired) copies in the genome.  MSUD utilizes common RNA interference (RNAi) factors (e.g., Argonaute) to target specific mRNA transcripts.  Using the tools they have developed (e.g., protein interaction assays, mutant strains, RNA profiles, and cellular markers) and various complementary approaches (e.g., biochemistry, cytology, genetics, and molecular biology), the investigators plan to characterize Neurospora mutants defective in MSUD and examine how proteins from various sites of MSUD activity contribute to the silencing pathway."

Replicative helicases unwind duplex DNA into templates for replication. In contrast to the extensive understanding of the translocation of DnaB along single stranded DNA (ssDNA), relatively little is known about the mechanisms of helicase opening, helicase assembly on ssDNA, and closing of the helicase as mediated by helicase loaders, which this research will address. A main mission of scientists-teachers is to attract and retain of students to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields and to prepare an educated citizenry for the 21st century. City College of New York (CCNY) has the additional mission of providing a high-quality education to the children of New York City (NYC), new immigrants, minorities, and those without economic means. To meet these missions, the PI will 1) mentor and train younger colleagues through research on DNA replication, a fundamental biological process; 2) lead undergraduate research programs; and 3) perform educational outreach to four public schools in NYC, each with a significant minority population.<br/><br/>Analyses of mechanisms used by cells to replicate DNA are essential for understanding how genomes are inherited and evolve. In E. coli, the replicative helicase is a closed protein ring whose assembly on single stranded (ss) DNA requires specialized loading factors. Assembly of the helicase takes place during the initiation phase of DNA replication. The major events of this phase include selection of sites where replication will begin, melting of a segment of origin DNA and then loading the helicase on ssDNA. The helicase-loader complex first captures the hexameric DnaB helicase and then engages ssDNA at the origin. This leads to expulsion of the loader from the origin complex, and concomitant helicase activation with adoption of a closed spiral conformer. The planar and spiral structures of the helicase are known, however, less is known about the mechanisms of helicase loading. The investigators have determined the structure of the DnaB helicase bound to the P helicase loader from phage &#955;. This project will focus on insights obtained from the structure. Insights from the structure obtained in this research, when combined with those from other groups, lead to a new model of the helicase assembly pathway in bacteria. The aims below seek to extend and test insights obtained from the investigators' revised model. Aim #1 focuses on evaluating and extending insights obtained from the BP model. In aim #2, they pivot to analysis of the BP complex bound to origin derived ssDNA. They will further explore one feature of their model: that the DnaB helicase, while bound to the helicase loader, may make few, if any, contacts to ssDNA. Instead, most, if not all, of the contacts will be made by the loader within the helicase-loader complex. In aim #3, they turn their attention to mechanisms associated with delivery of the BP complex to the phage &#955; origin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The safest way to repair a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is through a process called homologous recombination (HR). The known mechanisms of HR utilize an intact copy of the DNA sequence as a template to retrieve the information lost at the site of a DSB. However, recent results, which will be expanded in this study, indicate a new role of RNA in this process of DNA repair. Therefore, the study will provide important new biological insights to better understanding the physiological function of RNA in DNA repair, and the impact of RNA on genome maintenance and evolution. A postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and several undergraduate students will be involved in the research. The work and findings of this proposal will be integrated in class topics and activities for many graduate and undergraduate students. Through the inclusion of a Research Experience for Teachers (RET), the project will also target students from a local, 100%-minority High School to support student interest and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs.<br/><br/>To characterize the mechanism of RNA-DNA recombination, novel genetic systems will be developed to study repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous transcript RNA in budding yeast cells. One Objective of this project will be to identify the DNA polymerization function/s that use RNA as template in RNA-DNA recombination. Another focus will be to examine whether the process of DSB repair by transcript RNA can be visualized in cells arrested at two distinct points in the cell cycle: before and after DNA replication. It was shown that DSB repair by transcript RNA in yeast cells is initiated efficiently, but it is quickly suppressed by cellular ribonuclease H enzymes. Here, refined genetic systems to detect DSB repair by RNA will be utilized to determine the efficiency of DSB repair by transcript RNA in wild-type and ribonuclease-defective cells.

Plants as sessile organisms have to continuously defend themselves against environmental stresses and optimal stress responses are critical for survival, reproduction and crop yield. Stress responses require reprogramming of gene expression. Additionally, gene expression changes need to be rapid and reversible. This project will investigate how the essential Polycomb gene silencing mechanism contributes to plant water stress response and whether rapid synthesis of a class of non-expressed RNA molecules directs the Polycomb silencing machinery to the appropriate genes to be silenced. The project will provide insight into how plant drought responses can be enhanced and will provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate and high school students. Undergraduate students will participate in experimental research in laboratory courses and in the research laboratory using state-of-the-art experimental approaches. Students will design experiments, implement procedures and learn to communicate about science. Formative and summative assessments will help improve the efficacy of the laboratory course. Related high school laboratory exercises will be developed and PI Wagner will give lectures and workshops to high school students about this project during summer research academies.<br/><br/>In recent years it has become apparent that the majority of the genome is transcribed as noncoding transcripts, the roles of which are poorly understood. RNA abundance can change more rapidly than protein abundance, making lncRNAs ideally suited to direct chromatin regulatory complexes to new sites in the genome in response to environmental cues. This project will identify lncRNAs that recruit Polycomb complexes to new loci upon water stress sensing using four complementary approaches. First, regions to which Polycomb complexes are rapidly recruited and that are silenced upon water stress sensing will be defined by genomic approaches. Second, lncRNAs that specifically associate with the Polycomb complexes in response to the stress will be identified by combined biochemical and high-throughput sequencing approaches. Third, nuclear protein-bound lncRNA will be identified whose abundance increases under stress conditions by high-throughput sequencing. Finally, Polycomb-associated lnRNAs that increase in abundance upon stress sensing will be tested for biological roles in plant stress response and in Polycomb recruitment using reverse genetic approaches. Findings from this study will significantly enhance understanding of Polycomb recruitment, lncRNA function and transcriptional reprogramming during water stress response. The results ultimately will enable us to modulate chromatin regulatory complex recruitment to enhance desirable traits in plants such as tolerance to drought and other stresses.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Experiments will address whether an early Earth ancestor of T. ammonificans was originally a hydrogen-oxidizing, sulfur-reducing bacterium that could form needed organic substances from simple inorganic substances (such as carbon dioxide). With the gradual rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, more efficient terminal electron acceptors became available and this bacterium acquired genes that increased its metabolic flexibility - e.g., the capacity to use nitrate as well as carbon dioxide - while retaining ancestral metabolic traits (such as the ability to live without oxygen and survive high temperatures). The mechanisms of carbon fixation, anaerobic respiration and detoxification of reactive oxygen species in T. ammonificans  will be investigated using a combination of transcriptomic, proteomic and biomass carbon stable isotope analyses. This study will provide invaluable information on gene expression in T. ammonificans grown under chemical and nutrient conditions that reflect, as closely as possible, those encountered in its natural environment and will provide insight on gene regulation and expression in response to changing environmental conditions.

DNA is the long-term storage unit for genetic information, providing instructions for cellular and life functions. Access to different genetic regions is partially regulated by reversible chemical changes to localized regions of the DNA, defined as epigenetic modifications. This project evaluates the role of a small family of proteins, the ZBTB family, that are important in making these epigenetic modifications. The broader impacts for this project include two major aspects: First, the training of graduate students in an interdisciplinary research program that utilizes a broad spectrum of techniques to identify and characterize the three ZBTB. Second, this project includes the development of biochemical and DNA-focused hands-on and inquiry-based activities at The Leonardo, a museum in downtown Salt Lake City. In addition to the broader public, The Leonardo accommodates a significant number of students from underrepresented and underserved groups from Salt Lake Valley schools.

While insight into how the DNA methylation mark is established and removed has been gained, there is only minimal knowledge for the mechanisms by which methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs),read DNA methylation marks and translate this information into a specific transcriptional outcome, particularly for the ZBTB MBPs. An understanding for how the ZBTB MBPs modulate transcription is complicated by the fact that they exhibit bimodal DNA recognition, targeting both methylated and sequence-specific non-methylated DNA sites, which affords them the capability of functioning as both transcriptional repressors and activators. Additionally, each of the ZBTB MBPs can interact with multiple co-repressor/-activator protein complexes at target gene sites. Thus, an understanding for how each of these proteins elicits selectivity for their binding partners is central to discerning their role in transcriptional regulation. To investigate this, a combined in vitro biophysical and in cell approach will be utilized to delineate the mechanisms by which this family of MBPs recognize their DNA and proteins targets. The overall goals are to structurally characterize ZBTB protein:DNA interactions to gain mechanistic insight into how each protein preferentially selects DNA targets; to utilize function-specific mutations to probe the molecular basis for bimodal DNA recognition; and to define protein interactomes for each ZBTB MBP. The outcomes of this research will provide an essential foundation for the larger goal of discerning the full mechanisms by which each member of this under studied family of ZBTB MBPs elicits selective gene targeting, recruits specific protein complexes to the target site and alters transcription to provide a particular cellular function."

The project is designed to determine how different mitochondrial subpopulations within cells, distinguished from one another based on differences in size, energy-producing activity, and other endpoints, are either amplified or removed in response to specific cues that work in concert to coordinate cellular function. This research incorporates many important teaching and training goals by engaging students across academic levels (including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students) and backgrounds through their participation in research activities involving the application of next-generation scientific tools to drive new discoveries. The project specifically encourages, and implements a recruiting strategy for, the active participation of under-represented high school and undergraduate students interested in pursuing careers in STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics). <br/><br/>How subpopulations of mitochondria are differentially governed to maintain homeostatic balance between mitochondrial integrity and dysfunction are not known. Although mitochondria are heterogeneous with respect to function, DNA content, and morphology, little is understood regarding how mitochondrial properties are regulated on a per organelle basis, and why some mitochondria have a function distinct from others in the same cell. A major unresolved question in cell biology revolves around how 'mitochondrial heterogeneity' arises, and how variability between mitochondrial subpopulations can impact cellular functions. This project will test the hypothesis that distinct populations of mitochondria are preferentially allocated and set aside by the cell, but can be triggered to activate under certain physiological conditions, while dysfunctional mitochondria are preferentially eliminated via mitophagy (selective degradation of mitochondria by the cell). This fundamental knowledge and insight into how mitochondrial subpopulations can be differentially governed extends the current understanding of intracellular organization and is broadly applicable across eukaryotes.

Usually DNA repair is a precise process that serves to preserve the integrity of the genome.  Surprisingly though, some types of repair used for joining broken DNA ends are very prone to errors. How and why this occurs is not clear.  This research seeks to discover what makes end-joining repair so error-prone and what DNA sequence contexts might favor such imprecision. The results will provide crucial information that could prove useful for researchers who want to intentionally prevent or promote inaccurate repair, such as when conducting genome editing manipulations. Furthermore, the research will provide undergraduate and graduate-level scientists with transferable skills in molecular biology, genomics, computational modeling, and effective mentoring techniques. Finally, the project will engage a network of current and former lab members as public ambassadors for basic science research.<br/><br/>Alternative end-joining is an error-prone mechanism of DNA double-strand break repair, which leads to small deletions and insertions at the break site. Accumulating evidence suggests that these DNA changes may result from the iterative action of the specialized translesion DNA polymerase, theta, with various accessory proteins. However, little is known about how these proteins interact with DNA sequences in the vicinity of the breaks and what role the DNA sequences themselves might play. One hypothesis is that the DNA on one side of the break forms transient secondary structures, such as short loops and hairpins, which drive production of new single-stranded DNA. The nascent strands then pair with microhomologous sequences on the other side of the break and serve as templates for completing the repair, thereby leading to a variety of repair products. This hypothesis will be tested in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, an organism that relies heavily on alternative end-joining repair and is uniquely amenable to studying how different tissue types or developmental stages might influence this error-prone process. A systematic combination of genetic manipulation, high throughput amplicon sequencing, and computational modeling will be used to characterize different types of secondary-structure forming sequences and the various classes of repair junctions they produce as a result of alternative end-joining. Finally, a possible role of alternative end-joining in repair of breaks induced by the genome editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9,  will be assessed; the results of this experiment could provide an avenue for extending the basic understanding of this type of DNA repair to improving current practices for genome editing."

Bacteroidetes lacks the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a well-known control elelment that is required for translation of RNA into proteins in most other bacteria, and this research is aimed at determining what takes its place in this bacterial lineage. This project will also provide (1) research training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, (2) summer research opportunities for local high school students (Columbus Public Schools), and (3) faculty mentorship for students of the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which aims to boost the success rate of underrepresented minority students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines.<br/><br/>Initiation of translation involves assembly of a ribosome complex in which the initiator tRNA is paired to the start codon of mRNA. The fidelity of translation depends on recognition of the correct start codon among all AUG and similar trinucleotide sequences in the mRNA. In E. coli and many bacteria, recognition of the start codon is facilitated in part by base pairing between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the mRNA (which lies just upstream from the start codon), and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence of the 30S subunit (contained near the 3? end of the 16S rRNA). Recent genome sequencing studies have revealed that whole taxonomic groups of bacteria completely lack SD sequences, despite that the ASD sequence remains intact and conserved in these organisms. These include the phyla Bacteroidetes and a subset of Cyanobacteria. The primary goals of this project are to uncover the sequence determinants of the translation initiation regions (TIRs) in the Bacteroidetes and understand how these TIR sequences govern the rate of initiation. Modern techniques such as ribosome profiling will be used in conjunction with biochemical approaches to achieve these goals. Features of the TIR aside from the SD, such as secondary structure and S1 binding sites, are also thought to impact initiation rate in bacteria. By studying the Bacteriodetes system, the roles of these features may be clarified, as the complication of SD-ASD pairing is effectively removed."

Heme is required by much of life, enabling a vast number of proteins and cellular processes to function properly. However, heme is also known to promote cellular dysfunction due to its toxic properties. How do cells and organisms utilize heme while mitigating its toxicity? The PI proposes that there are distinct molecules that help shuttle heme to different locations in a controlled manner and various physiological stimuli can initiate heme mobilization. Using heme sensors recently developed in the PI's laboratory, graduate, undergraduate, and high school/middle school students will collaborate to determine how cellular heme is handled and mobilized throughout the cell. This research will not only reveal the manner by which cells manage an ""essential toxin"" like heme, but also provide new tools and methodologies that will benefit the large community of scientists that study heme. Moreover, the research will be used as a vehicle to promote participation of under-represented minorities in science. A long-term scientific mentorship program will be developed in which Hispanic middle school students from metro-Atlanta will work with the PI's group to implement the research. <br/><br/>Heme is well known as an essential iron containing cofactor. A number of heme regulated factors and processes are conserved from yeast to man, suggesting a role for heme as a dynamic signaling molecule. This project aims to reimagine and expand the role of heme in cell biology as a signaling molecule. The cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity of heme requires that it be trafficked in a highly coordinated manner from its site of synthesis in the mitochondria to hemoproteins present in every subcellular compartment, including the nucleus. However, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate the initiation, transmission, and integration of heme-based signals and the spatio-temporal dynamics of heme mobilization for trafficking and signaling are unknown. This is in large part due to the lack of tools available to image labile heme pools relevant to trafficking and signaling. The PI's group has recently overcome this major technological barrier by generating genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors. The project will utilize these heme sensors in conjunction with mass spectrometry based proteomics and yeast molecular genetics to delineate the molecules and mechanisms that mediate heme trafficking and signaling and their dynamics."

The project will also provide interdisciplinary education and training in genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology for high school teachers, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.  High school science teachers will spend two summers in the laboratory, participating directly in research activities and developing inquiry-based learning modules related to plant biology research, which they will bring back to their classrooms. This partnership will establish long-term connections to teachers to increase their students' ability to analyze quantitative information and generate knowledge from scientific exploration. <br/><br/>Seed development in flowering plants is regulated, in part, by genes that are imprinted.  Gene imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon whereby alleles of genes are differentially expressed depending on whether they are inherited from the male or female parent.  To understand and manipulate seed biology to beneficial effect requires deciphering the regulation and function of imprinted gene expression. Recent studies have created catalogues of imprinted genes in diverse plant species, and have yielded important insights about the extent of imprinting and the types of genes subject to imprinted expression. However, it remains unclear whether all imprinting is functional, or whether some instances of imprinting are bystander events due to genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming processes. The major aims of this research project are to comprehensively evaluate the function of imprinted genes in seed development, to test whether pure epigenetic variation is sufficient to induce imprinting variation, and to understand the gene networks that regulate imprinting by taking advantage of natural variation in imprinting phenotypes. This research will have substantial outcomes in further determining the functional consequences of imprinting and in understanding epigenetic mechanisms that regulate imprinted expression, increasing our understanding of seed biology and role of natural variation in these processes. Finally, tools to precisely engineer the DNA methylome in a sequence specific manner will be developed, allowing a direct test of whether specific DNA methylation patterns are necessary and sufficient for imprinted expression. These tools have the potential to be functional in other plant and animal species."

The answers to this fundamental question underpin the ability to understand and predict evolution. While trying to study this question by introducing mutations in the lab, it was learned that mutations very often result in the production of protein variants that do not fold correctly in space. In the living cell, there are several systems that assist the protein folding process (known as the cellular proteostasis network), and they help some of the mutant proteins fold correctly. By perturbing the proteostasis systems, the investigator hopes to learn more about the mutations that actually happen during protein evolution. This project will use the influenza viruses, which can evolve rapidly in the lab and chemical probes that can turn on and off various parts of the proteostasis machinery. The research is linked to developing and testing an outreach program targeted at the local homeschooled student community. Opportunities offered include high school student internships related to the research, chemistry demonstration shows, and the development and testing of biomolecule models for take-home experiments that teach students about evolution and protein folding.<br/><br/>This research is uncovering how metazoan proteostasis mechanisms beyond the HSP90 chaperone influence protein evolution at the molecular level. A battery of custom-designed chemical biology tools is used to perturb the composition and activities of key components of the metazoan proteostasis network with high precision using small molecules. The effects of these different proteostasis environments on protein evolutionary trajectories are studied by leveraging rapidly evolving RNA viruses propagating in metazoan cells, with a focus on influenza A. The highly interdisciplinary experimental approach encompasses deep mutational scanning of individual viral proteins, and optimized sequencing, modeling, and biophysical analysis strategies to enable quantitative assessment of the results. The outcomes will be a new appreciation for the complex interplay between the proteostasis network and client protein evolution, with important implications for understanding and predicting viral evolution at the molecular level. Testing roles of the proteostasis network in buffering protein evolution will also elucidate previously unknown functions of specific proteostasis network components.

A wide range of such assemblies, which include amyloids (molecular assembiles responsible for neurodegenerative diseases), lipid membrane protein complexes and chromatin, play important roles in fundamental biological processes and mechanisms. In this project, the PI is developing new solid-state NMR methodologies for the determination of protein structures and interactions, which focus on measurements of long-range structural restraints and overcome some of the key challenges associated with conventional solid-state NMR techniques.  The research aims of the project are integrated with education and outreach activities involving diverse groups of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. These activities, which include intensive, full-time summer research internship programs for undergraduate and local high-school students organized annually in the PI's laboratory, aim to directly impact students in the earliest stages of their educational experience by introducing them to cutting edge interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology, and physics, building their confidence in themselves and their scientific abilities, and encouraging them to think of science in a broad, discovery-based manner. The ultimate goal is to increase student participation and retention in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The unique feature of the proposed novel NMR methods being developed lies in their use of covalently-attached paramagnetic tags, which enable up to ~20  electron-nucleus distance restraints to be simultaneously accessed for multiple protein sites via multidimensional NMR approaches. Already having recently demonstrated that it is possible to elucidate protein structures in a de novo manner by using paramagnetic solid-state NMR, the current project aims to further advance this methodology by developing compact and versatile metal binding tags that permit measurements of a broad range of paramagnetic effects, systematically exploring the limits of high-resolution protein structure determination by paramagnetic solid-state NMR, and expanding the realm of applicability of this technology beyond model globular proteins in microcrystalline phase to large assemblies of biological macromolecules."

The extraordinary synthetic capability of the protein biosynthesis system has driven extensive efforts to harness it for societal needs in areas as diverse as energy, materials, and medicine. For example, recombinant protein production has transformed the lives of millions of people through the synthesis of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. In nature, however, only limited sets of protein monomers are utilized, thereby resulting in limited sets of biopolymers (i.e., proteins). Expanding nature's repertoire of ribosomal monomers could yield new classes of enzymes, therapeutics, materials, and chemicals with diverse chemistry. In the short term, this will expand the genetic code in a unique and transformative way. In the long-term, knowledge gained will allow researchers to diversify, evolve and repurpose the ribosome and the entire protein synthesis system to generate non-natural polymers as new classes of sequence-defined, evolvable matter. This proposal will also promote interdisciplinary education, including the specific expansion of STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women. Students will be trained to integrate principles from genome engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology. As a form of outreach, the investigators will create experiential learning modules that bring synthetic biology research to K-12 and undergraduate classrooms and connect students to the science being done at our institutions. This new outreach program will ensure that advances made in this project benefit a broader community and will contribute to motivating and training young scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators seek to repurpose the translation apparatus for making new proteins containing multiple mirror-image D-alpha-amino acids. By seamlessly melding the integration of bottom-up engineering design, genome engineering, and full-scale systems optimization, the project will create a new framework for studying and engineering translation and the genetic code. This framework will be instrumental in sustaining the much-anticipated transformation in expanding the range of genetically encoded chemistry in living systems, with the potential for significant breakthroughs. For example, understanding the structural and substrate flexibility of the protein synthesis machinery may provide insights into life's origin and also lead to general rules for engineering protein synthesis to meet societal needs. From an engineering perspective, the research could enable scalable mirror image polypeptide synthesis, opening the door to cheaper and more effective peptidomimetic enzymes, materials, and drugs, and expanding the scope of synthetic and chemical biology. In sum, it is expected that this project will provide new directions for academic and industrial enterprises related to engineering translation, while simultaneously training the next generation of scientists and engineers to be full participants in the work force."

One of SE's functions is to make small microRNAs (miRNAs) from larger RNA molecules, and the other function is to quiet the activity of certain potentially harmful DNA elements in the genome. The bi-functional nature of SE is thought to arise from its ability to interact with different protein partners, and this research aims to test that idea.  Because SE is conserved in both plants and animals, the results could have far-reaching benefits for many fields of science and for society, such as in plant biotechnology where the results could contribute to improvement of agricultural traits. This project is well-suited for undergraduate student participation and provides hands-on training in genetics, genomics, and biochemistry. The project also offers opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to develop their professional careers at the forefront of an emerging field, and thus the research will contribute to building a creative and highly skilled workforce to support the steady growth of the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>SE is known to be a core component of the miRNA processing machinery (microprocessor) in plants. The SE ortholog in mammals is known to function as a transcription factor. Preliminary evidence suggests that interaction of SE with a chromatin-remodeling factor is associated with its function in miRNA processing, whereas interaction with a histone methyltransferase may mediate its function in silencing transposable elements.  Experimental aims will explore the mechanisms underlying these two functions. Results that implicate SE activity in miRNA biogenesis could provide new strategies to better regulate miRNA production and to improve the efficacy and safety of technologies and therapies that depend on small RNAs. Moreover, exploring the novel function of SE in regulating transposable elements will lead to new discoveries uniting the fields of RNA metabolism and transcriptional silencing, and may also provide new ideas about how to conquer disorders in plants and animals that result from the mis-regulation of chromatin-level gene silencing."

The complexity of life in eukaryotic organisms (from yeast to plants to humans) is due in part to modifications that occur dynamically to proteins, which allow proteins to have different functions at different times as a result of a series of potential modifications. The most common modifications of proteins within cells include phosphorylation, the addition of one or more phosphate groups, and O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of a sugar. These modifications are central to a wide range of cellular functions. Both phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation can occur on the same sites within proteins, but how these modifications affect the structure of these proteins, and therefore how they can affect the function of these proteins, is generally poorly understood. This work will provide a comprehensive understanding of how phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation affect protein structure. This work will train undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows in multidisciplinary methods in science that are necessary for scientific advances in the 21st century, preparing them to be scientific leaders who can work across diverse fields. One significant challenge in undergraduate laboratory education is the engagement of students in current research. This work will also develop new undergraduate laboratories that both train students comprehensively in multiple techniques and that directly involve students in scientific research. The results of these undergraduate laboratory experiments will both be included as part of the scientific literature and will provide new methods for teaching students in methods in structural biology.<br/><br/>Protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation are central to signal transduction in all eukaryotes. Protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation are competing intracellular protein post-translational modifications of serine and threonine residues, which modulate signal transduction cascades to control cellular function. Phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation have diverse functional effects, which are sometimes complementary and sometimes opposing in function. This work will develop new principles and directions to understand biological function and to specifically understand structural effects of protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. This work will combine theory, bioinformatics, experiments in solution, and experiments by x-ray crystallography to provide a detailed framework for understanding the effects of post-translational modifications on structure and function, with application to systems from yeast to plants to mammals. The research will use peptides and proteins combined with structural analysis by circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations to examine independently and comparatively the effects of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation on modulating the structure of proteins, specifically examining the differences due to modification at serine versus threonine residues. Peptides will be synthesized to analyze the effects of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of serine and threonine on structure in diverse contexts, including in short model peptides amenable to detailed NMR analysis, ab initio calculations, and small-molecule x-ray crystallography, and in larger peptides and proteins amenable to thermodynamic characterization, enzymology, and protein x-ray crystallography. These experiments will lead to new insights in the roles of the post-translational modifications of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation on protein structure and function in intracellular signaling and on the differential roles of serine and threonine residues in proteins. This work will also develop new theoretical understanding of the bases for phosphorylation- and O-GlcNAcylation-mediated structural changes, applicable to more accurate modeling of proteins with post-translational modifications. This work will specifically develop new discovery-oriented undergraduate laboratories that will train students in solid-phase reactions, peptide synthesis, comparative studies of amino acids, and structural analysis using 1-D and 2-D NMR, while simultaneously having students in introductory labs contribute to the development of scientific knowledge."

To read and copy their RNA genomes, VSV and related RNA viruses make a special RNA polymerase that makes RNA copies of the viral RNA genomes, and therefore are called ""RNA dependent RNA Polymerases"" or RdRPs. This project will examine the mechanism by which RdRPs read and copy the viral genome template in infected cells which is critical for the replication of viruses. The results from this study will improve scientific understanding of how RdRPs work and identify potential target mechanisms for inhibition of viral infections.

When stretched, the genome template of VSV is more than 4 microns in size and RdRPs can only initiate transcription on its 3' end. While 50 RdRPs are tightly bound to this template, how they initiate and sustain transcription is not clear. The live cell imaging experiments will determine the number of active RdRPs per genome and their cooperativity. Measurements of the concentration of free RdRPs not bound to the genome will verify if a dissociation and 3' binding mechanism can support viral transcription in vivo. This project will also use reconstituted templates in vitro to visualize the mechanism by which RdRPs redistribute on the genome template. We have observed single RdRP sliding on purified genome templates in vitro. In this project we will further characterize the sliding mechanism of RdRPs on genome templates. By measuring the dynamics of RdRPs in vivo as well as in vitro this project will determine the mechanism of transcription by RdRPs during VSV RNA virus infection.<br/><br/>The project was funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

We also now recognize that, beyond this linear sequence, modifications to the DNA bases can also be transferred from the parent to affect how this code is interpreted in daughter cells; this is the epigenetic code. Methylation is a well-studied epigenetic marker, but the oxidation of methyl groups on cytosine, to form hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) constitutes a less common, but no less important epigenetic marker.

The results from this project will have significant impact on our understanding of epigenetic markers and their biological functions.

The function of 5hmC has generally been recognized as being an intermediate in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine; however, recent mapping of 5hmC occurrence across genomes suggests that the modified base serves as an epigenetic marker and affects transcription in a tissue dependent manner. In addition, evidence suggests that 5hmC promotes recombination in vitro and in vivo, through a pathway dependent on the general nucleotide cutting enzyme endonuclease G (EndoG). The project will test the hypothesis that 5hmC plays a structural role by stabilizing a recombination intermediate (the four stranded DNA Holliday junction), which can provide specificity to EndoG, even though the enzyme does not appear to discriminate between 5hmC-modified and unmodified DNAs. The goal of this project is to test a model that 5hmC stabilizes Holliday junctions in inverted repeat sequences, thereby providing a stable intermediate for EndoG to bind and cut. The aims to achieve this goal are: Aim 1) crystallographic and calorimetric studies to determine the effects of 5hmC-modification on the structure and thermodynamic stability of DNA Holliday junctions; Aim 2) biochemical studies to determine the structural context and mechanism by which EndoG recognizes 5hmC-modifications in DNA; and Aim 3) biochemical studies to determine whether 5hmC-modifications pauses the junction to allow site specific cutting by EndoG."

Germ cell nanoparticles have been remarkably conserved across animal phyla indicating their crucial biological importance. In addition, this research may promote design of artificial nanoparticles with desired molecular characteristics thereby leading to technological breakthroughs. This project will involve undergraduate, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar and will provide opportunities for training of future active participants in science and education fields.

Components of these complexes include Tudor domain-containing proteins, Piwi proteins, small Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and enzymes of the glycolytic cluster. These complexes play a major role in the silencing of transposable elements, which otherwise might lead to harmful mutations. However, the mechanisms controlling their assembly remains a mystery. To address this gap, a combination of approaches--including genetics, biochemistry, as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments--will be used to test the roles of the component proteins in assembly of these germ cell particles in Drosophila.  Because these structures have been evolutionarily conserved, this research can serve as a paradigm for studying other large and dynamic ribonucleoprotein granules.

Such modifications may lead to changes in the protein's function that help organisms respond to altered conditions, including temperature change. The research is focused on a plant amylase, an enzyme that breaks down leaf starch and appears to play a role in cold stress survival. This enzyme is inhibited by a mechanism involving the reversible modification of certain amino acids that may occur during cold stress. This type of modification is poorly understood but is thought to be widespread in all organisms responding to environmental stress. The modified amino acids in the amylase have been identified and this project will characterize how these modifications affect enzyme activity and what it is that makes these amino acids sensitive to this specific modification. The research will be carried out at a predominantly undergraduate institution and involve at least 10 undergraduates, helping prepare them for graduate school, professional schools or other careers in science. The students will be involved in all aspects of the work and be able to present their results at regional and national conferences. In addition, the project will support a postdoctoral scholar as she gains experience in teaching and mentoring undergraduates in research, skills that are essential to her eventual goal of working at an undergraduate institution. <br/><br/>Glutathionylation of proteins at specific cysteine residues is an important post-translational modification but little is known about what makes some cysteines sensitive to glutathionylation while others are insensitive. In addition, there are no examples in plants where the physiological effects of protein glutathionylation are understood. In this project the well-studied model plant Arabidopsis thaliana will be used to investigate two members of the &#946;-amylase (BAM) gene family, one of which, BAM3, is inhibited by glutathionylation and the other, BAM1, is not. The two objectives of the project are: 1) to characterize the glutathionylation of BAM3 and the effects of this modification on catalytic activity using site directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry and homology modeling, and 2) to identify key factors influencing the susceptibility of cysteines to glutathionylation.  A conserved Cys residue was identified that is sensitive to glutathionylation in BAM3 but is insensitive in BAM1. Sequence alignments and homology modeling of BAM3 and BAM1 sequences across plants revealed a number of residues that differ between the two BAMs, but are conserved within each type and may influence the sensitivity to glutathionylation. A combination of computational modeling and protein mutagenesis will be used to characterize the factors affecting this glutathionylation event. Results from these experiments will lead to the development of a more accurate model for predicting the sensitivity of cysteine residues to glutathionylation in other proteins, and to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in stress acclimation."

Protein binding to DNA is important for many aspects of DNA function as a means for storing and transmitting information in a cell.  DNA flexibility is studied using both computational and experimental methods, but experimental studies testing computational predictions have lagged, leaving a big gap in our understanding.  This study will provide an experimental dataset that will significantly expand our understanding of one type of DNA deformability, contributing to the overall efforts by the DNA mechanics community to rationally predict and map sequence-dependent DNA conformations and deformations. Specifically, the research targets sequence patterns that render DNA highly kinkable, leading to improved rules for recognizing such sites and their protein binding partners. As participants in the research activities, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in a cross-disciplinary research environment. The PI will contribute to curriculum revisions leading to more quantitative skills for life science majors, and will develop biophysics-related lab activities to be integrated into the curriculum for physics majors. These efforts, together with biophysics courses the PI previously developed, will be integrated into a planned Biophysics major at the PI's institution. Longer range goals are to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program in Molecular and Cellular Biophysics. The PI will work with high school teachers to develop teaching modules at the growing interface between physics and biology, and host high school students in her lab in the summer. The PI will also mentor, through summer research activities, underrepresented students recruited through an outreach program at the PI's institution. <br/><br/>This study brings together multifaceted approaches to elucidate the rules that govern DNA sequence-dependent shape and deformability, and to examine how these variations in DNA flexibility influence protein binding. This study will identify highly deformable DNA sequences using in vitro selection of random sequences that bind with high affinity to architectural IHF/HU family of DNA bending proteins that severely kink DNA at two sites. The sequence patterns that enable this high degree of kinking will be important for developing models of sequence-dependent DNA deformability that go well beyond the small base-step deformations described by harmonic potentials. The intrinsic DNA deformability of selected sequences will be investigated using laser temperature-jump spectroscopy, biochemical assays, NMR-probed base pair dynamics, and computational modeling of bending deformations. The researchers will (1) examine the correlation between protein-binding affinities and DNA deformation energies; (2) investigate how the variations in the binding affinities are reflected in the DNA-bending rates to form the complex; and (3) examine the potential for spontaneous bending/kinking of these DNA substrates by (i) measuring base-pair dynamics at kink sites using NMR approaches; (ii) probing their reactivity within the context of minicircles by biochemically detecting kinks and unpaired bases induced by severe bending; (iii) modeling structural dynamics of highly deformable sequences. This study will generate a comprehensive dataset of sequence patterns that underpin DNA dynamics and flexibility.

To function, an organism copies specific genetic information from genes in its DNA to molecules called RNA and then uses that RNA as templates to make proteins. Proteins are the molecular machines that carry out the work of cells and give cells their identities. It is not clear what causes the amount of protein that cells make to differ between individuals. It is known that this can be caused by differences in how much RNA is made. However, individuals may differ in how fast they make protein from the same amount of RNA and also how quickly they recycle protein when it gets old. The research will measure RNA and protein levels in two different strains of budding yeast as they respond to mating pheromone. It will involve both broad surveys of many proteins and detailed measurements of a targeted set. While engaging in this research, students at a primarily undergraduate institution and a postdoctoral fellow will gain interdisciplinary training in the emerging field of evolutionary systems biology. Students from a junior high school will also be engaged in scientific discovery; they will collect wild yeasts from the air and from tree bark and identify their relationships to each other in the fungal tree of life, fulfilling the requirements of the Next Generation Science Standards recently adopted by California and Washington.<br/><br/><br/>Specifically, the project seeks to systematically characterize the causes of divergence in protein expression temporal dynamics using a unique combination of high-throughput phenotyping, modeling, cellular resolution quantitative trait mapping, and targeted functional analysis. The mating pheromone response network of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used as a model system. The research will identify the contribution of variation in mRNA levels, protein production rates, and protein degradation rates to protein levels. Applying this approach to a network of genes will elucidate the general trends in how protein expression variation arises. Identifying the causal polymorphisms underlying protein expression variation will point to the molecular mechanisms for such variation.

This project will develop novel methods that will allow researchers to understand the complex process of RNA folding in biology, and to control this process to produce designed RNA molecules with desired three-dimensional shapes for use in synthetic biology. The project has the potential to revolutionize the study of RNA folding, providing a better understanding of how RNAs fold in living cells.

Breaking the exogenous displacing DNA strand into two segments or introducing mismatches in it allows the introduction of controlled pausing in folding. Initial characterization of the system will follow folding of fluorescent aptamers, and later studies will be directed at understanding folding of the coenzyme B12 riboswitch, a system known to require polymerase pausing. Critically, perturbations will not be introduced into the RNA itself, but will be engineered only into the displacing strand, providing a native fold in all cases. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize the study of RNA folding, providing a better understanding of how ncRNAs fold in vivo, and providing new tools for synthetic biology."

Beclin1, a protein essential for autophagy, has been directly implicated in these processes.  This research will focus on understanding the atomic-resolution structure and flexibility of Beclin1 to provide a better understanding of its critical role in autophagy and cellular maintenance.  This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students in North Dakota an unprecedented opportunity to train in classical and cutting edge methods of biophysical and biochemical research, and also have a substantial impact outside the laboratory by educating high-school teachers about biomacromolecular structure and function.  Over the period of this project, 40 high-school science teachers will participate in a summer professional development course to help them instruct their students in understanding the structures of biomacromolecules such as proteins and DNA.  Thus, the educational activities outlined in this project are designed to educate and mentor students at all levels: high school, undergraduate and graduate; and will have a broader impact far beyond the grant funding period.<br/><br/>Beclin1 appears to be a protein interaction hub for autophagy as it binds to over twenty diverse cellular proteins.

Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to assess secondary structure content, backbone flexibility and dynamic conformational changes.

However experimentally studying how protein motion is involved in their recognition of other proteins is challenging because proteins are large, complex molecules with parts that can move on different timescales. This research takes advantage of state-of-the-art methods in chemical biology and physical chemistry to place reporter chemical bonds at specific locations in a protein structure to test how the motions at different parts of the proteins change upon binding their partners.

Although protein dynamics are increasingly invoked as contributors to protein function, rigorous experimental assessment of their role has been challenged by both the spatial heterogeneity of proteins and the rapid interconversion of potentially important conformational states. This research combines the inherent high temporal resolution of linear FT and 2D infrared (IR) spectroscopy with the spatial resolution afforded by site-selective incorporation of vibrational reporter groups via protein engineering to generate the highest resolution picture possible of the conformational dynamics involved in the yeast Sho1 Src homology 3 domain (SH3)-mediated recognition of its physiological target the proline-rich peptide derived from the protein Pbs2. A number of Pbs2 peptide variants and additional SH3 domains will be used to evaluate whether and how protein and/or ligand conformational dynamics modulate the affinity and specificity of molecular recognition, and specifically to test the model that poly-specificity results from increased protein and/or ligand flexibility involving a combination of slower timescale conformational dynamics in the unbound states via a conformational selection mechanism and faster timescale conformational dynamics via an induced-fit mechanism.

Carbon dioxide is taken up by algae and converted into macromolecules that are the building blocks for producing more cells; alternatively this carbon can be used to produce storage compounds such as starch and storage lipids (oil).  Very little is known about the metabolic control mechanisms that direct carbon towards these different fates.  This project uses the single celled green alga Chlamydomonas to investigate carbon partitioning under the control of a newly discovered signaling system involving a specialized class of molecules called inositol polyphosphates.  The regulation of inositol polyphosphates by light, carbon and other environmental cues will be determined and their impact on carbon metabolism will be measured and modeled so that the mechanism by which they control intracellular carbon partitioning can be pinpointed.  These studies will provide a deeper understanding of a key aspect of photosynthetic metabolism and enable the development of strategies for manipulating algae to improve yields of biotechnologically relevant compounds.  Two postdoctoral fellows and multiple undergraduate will receive cross-disciplinary training and mentoring in algal cell biology and physiology, metabolic modeling and mass spectrometry in a facility whose mission is to perform transformative science and train the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>A major challenge in biology is understanding how cells control the flux of carbon through metabolic networks to produce storage compounds versus growth to produce more cells. This project will decipher a new mode of intracellular signaling that uses inositol polyphosphates to control steady state metabolic flux into neutral lipids in a model photosynthetic eukaryote, Chlamydomonas.  Inositol polyphosphates and their biosynthetic enzymes play diverse roles in intracellular signaling, but have not been previously linked to photosynthetic carbon partitioning.  Because inositol polyphosphates are conserved, the outcomes of this research are likely to be broadly applicable for understanding algal and plant carbon partitioning.  The PIs hypothesize that inositol polyphosphates produced by Chlamydomonas VIP1 control metabolic responses that specifically impact the production of storage lipids (triacylglycerol). This research will: i) characterize VIP1 protein activity in vitro and test whether its predicted catalytic activities are required for function; ii) test the hypothesis that inositol polyphosphate isomer levels reflect differences in growth metabolism under different trophic conditions; iii) characterize transcriptomes and metabolomes of wild type and vip1-1 under different trophic conditions to identify areas where the mutant shows altered metabolic regulation; iv) employ quantitative metabolic flux modeling (INST-MFA) to identify branch points in carbon metabolism impacted by inositol polyphosphates.

This project will examine the mechanism by which RdRPs read and copy the viral genome template in infected cells, which is critical for the replication of viruses. The results from this study will improve scientific understanding of how RdRPs work and identify potential target mechanisms for inhibition of viral infections. This study will train students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, by engaging them within teams doing research at the University of Utah and University of Massachusetts Medical School at Worcester.

When stretched, the genome template of VSV is more than 4 microns in size and RdRPs can only initiate transcription on its 3' end. While 50 RdRPs are tightly bound to this template, how they initiate and sustain transcription is not clear. The live cell imaging experiments will determine the number of active RdRPs per genome and their cooperativity. Measurements of the concentration of free RdRPs not bound to the genome will verify if a dissociation and 3' binding mechanism can support viral transcription in vivo.  This project will also use reconstituted templates in vitro to visualize the mechanism by which RdRPs redistribute on the genome template.

Lipids are a key part of living cells and together with other macromolecules such as proteins, they form the membrane that surrounds all cells. Lipids support essential cell functions such as cell division and maintaining the membrane that surrounds and delimits the cell. The two main research objectives are: to understand the functional properties of two proteins that affect headgroup-acylated GPL levels in the cell as well as how levels of headgroup-acylated GPL are regulated in the bacterium; and the impact of changing levels of these lipids on how much the membrane can bend. This work will lay a basis for understanding the function of these minor, yet important, lipids and help, in future work, to explain the complexity of lipids in all cells. A third objective of this project is directly to engage underrepresented students in original research. An innovative program called Diving into Research brings six admitted Vassar College students to campus before the beginning of their freshman year to participate for 4 to 5 weeks in Vassar's 10-week Undergraduate Research Summer Institute. By establishing strong connections with peer and faculty research mentors early on, students from underrepresented groups, including low socioeconomic and first-generation college goers, are placed on a path to success in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)careers.<br/><br/>Throughout this project, undergraduate students will be involved in original research on the structure, function and biosynthesis of a class of understudied lipids called headgroup-acylated glycerophospholipids (GPLs) in the bacterium Escherichia coli.  The biosynthesis of lipids, including low abundance lipids such as headgroup-acylated GPLs, affects essential cell functions such as cell division and maintaining cell membrane integrity.  Determining the substrate specificity and enzymatic mechanism of two enzymes, PldB and At1g78690, known to impact headgroup-acylated GPL levels in E. coli, and the careful structural determination of these enzymes in vitro products, will provide valuable insights into the basis of each enzyme's unique catalytic mechanisms.  Students involved in this project will prepare lipid substrates and protein extracts, perform in vitro enzyme assays, purify enzymes and construct the necessary E. coli strains.  In addition, they will employ modern techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry to characterize lipid structure.  Understanding the impact of altering headgroup-acylated GPL levels in vivo will yield insights into how headgroup-acylated GPLs affect cell division and the maintenance of membrane integrity.  Experiments designed to understand how cells regulate headgroup-acylated GPL levels and how those lipids impact membrane curvature will expose undergraduate researchers to techniques in genetics and cell biology, including mutagenesis and confocal microscopy.  This work will yield insight into the biosynthesis and function of this under-investigated class of lipids related to their emerging roles in important cellular processes.  This research project, which will influence the field of lipid biochemistry by helping to explain the complexity of lipids in all cells, will positively affect participating undergraduates at Vassar College by expanding their opportunity to engage in substantial research in lipid biochemistry.  Every aspect of this research will directly involve undergraduate student researchers. They will present their work at scientific conferences as poster and oral presentations and publish in peer-reviewed journals, setting these students on a path to successful careers in STEM-related fields."

CRISPR-Cas9 is natively used by lower organisms such as bacteria to defend against viral infections. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is being adapted as a powerful tool for manipulating genomes of many organisms in a 'by-design and on-demand' fashion. On the horizon are innovations that use CRISPR-Cas9 to produce drought-resistant crops; to combat mosquito transmitted diseases such as malaria; and to cure human illness by fixing an individual's faulty DNA. While studies on CRISPR-Cas9 have advanced rapidly and are poised to revolutionize many fields in biology, details on its mechanism of action remain to be elucidated. This project will fill this knowledge gap by identifying the mechanisms by which RNA molecules convert Cas9's molecular structure into a form suitable for selecting DNA targets. Beyond advancing scientific understanding and methodologies, the project will explore collaborations with biotech companies that may yield new technological applications and promote economic developments. It also includes research training for students at all levels and curriculum innovations such as 'virtual reality' (VR) demonstrations of the Cas9-RNA complex, thus contributing to the development of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce.<br/><br/>The overall objective of the project is to elucidate the roles of specific domains of Cas9 and guide RNA in initiating and directing a cascade of conformational changes towards the state ready for DNA interrogation. The proposed work will leverage on the expertise of the PI in the functional and structural (X-ray crystallography) characterization of protein-nucleic acid complexes; and that of the Co-PI in site directed spin labeling studies of nucleic acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes. Experiments will focus on Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, the workhorse in genome engineering, and test an overarching hypothesis that the interactions of the bridge-helix of Cas9 with specific RNA elements, initiate and induce Cas9 domain rearrangements to assemble a DNA-interrogative protein-RNA complex.

Regulation of gene expression is crucial in many areas of biology, including differentiation, stem cell biology, and proper maintenance of tissues. To ensure proper gene expression, multiple genes regulate each other in a complex web of interactions called gene regulatory networks.  One approach to understanding the function of a gene regulatory network is to try to construct that network using synthetic circuits, and then directly examine how the construction of the synthetic network impacts the stability and robustness of gene expression.  In this project, investigators explore these concepts of stability and robustness, as well as sharpness in patterns of gene expression in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly).  In order to create synthetic circuits in the fruit fly, the investigators will first develop new synthetic biology tools for controlling gene expression in a complex organism, such that these synthetic gene regulatory networks can be created.  This work should lead to both new tools in synthetic biology for complex organisms as well as new understanding of gene regulatory network properties associated with pattern formation in the fruit fly. The investigators will also work with Science House, a North Carolina State University organization that oversees K-12 outreach to engage both high school students and teachers in the use of engineering principles in the study of biology, with a goal of enhancing participant?s appreciation and comfort with the use of quantitative tools in the study of biology.<br/><br/>Technical description: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), complex webs of genetic interactions, are hypothesized to explain emergent properties of developing tissues, such as the robustness and sharpness of gene expression. However, hypotheses of how these properties emerge from specific GRN motifs are difficult to verify, partly due to the high degree of complexity found in native GRNs. To overcome this difficulty, an alternative approach is proposed in which simpler, synthetic GRNs are designed to directly test these hypotheses. In this project, investigators will first develop tunable gene expression tools in Drosophila, including the use of ribozymes and other RNA expression control devices, as well as predictive tools for the design of such expression control devices.  They will then investigate the robustness of gene expression when controlled by a negative feedback motif, as well as the sharpness of gene expression when controlled by a mutual repression motif.  Previous studies of emergent properties of GRNs have produced as-yet untested hypotheses from computational models. This work will first develop standardized tools to tune gene expression levels in Drosophila, with expected applicability to other multicellular model organisms. The work will also test how specific GRN motifs result in the desired emergent properties of robustness and sharpness of gene expression boundaries. The work has broad applicability due to its focus on network motifs rather than specific systems or signaling pathways."

This is achieved by the intricate gene regulatory circuitry wired over years of evolution.  A relatively less studied but predominant form of gene regulation involves cis-antisense transcription that is found across all kingdoms of life. This includes thousands of cis-antisense gene pairs found in the human genome, many implicated in life-threatening diseases. cis-antisense transcription occurs when two genes on opposite strands of DNA have partially overlapping DNA. Such a configuration can give rise to gene products that can potentially silence expression of each other via a mechanism called cis antisense RNA regulation (cis-AR). Further the movement and traffic of proteins on the DNA in this region can also influence gene expression via a mechanism called transcriptional interference (TI). This project uncovers the design principles of gene regulation by engineering the mechanisms of cis-AR and TI, and examines their combination in advantageous ways to explore design of novel genetic devices for higher-order biological computing. The genetic devices built in this project can address important applications in biotechnology and biomedicine including gene therapy, cell fate control in cell therapy, and event-triggered protein expression during biofuel production, and creation of novel antibiotics against superbugs. This project will also cultivate a program to expose K-12 and undergraduate students to research opportunities, provide graduate students with mentorship, training and experience, and both groups to an improved awareness of applying their engineering education to solve biotechnological problems. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of functional role of cis-antisense transcription, and uncover the design principles of tunability and biological robustness as a result of gene regulatory mechanisms occurring during cis-antisense transcription. The project will explore different mechanisms of TI and cis-AR to identify and characterize novel sensory and regulatory elements to create novel synthetic genetic circuits and devices using biological parts. Firstly, genetic circuits will be built bottom up by engineering TI mechanisms of RNA polymerase collision, Sitting Duck interference and DNA roadblock to create novel biological parts. Secondly, novel synthetic genetic modules will be built by engineering cis-AR mechanisms of translational inhibition, transcriptional attenuation, and transcript co-degradation. Thirdly, TI and cis-AR based synthetic genetic modules will be combined to develop sophisticated and versatile logic gate devices that can achieve higher order computation. Finally, by combining positive and negative feedback loops based on TI, cis-AR, and feedback from proteins regulated by TI and cis-AR, robust synthetic bistable memory switches will be developed with fewer biological parts. This project will provide answers to the question whether cis-antisense transcription based gene regulation can give rise to a highly tunable system output, ranging from a simple-first order response to biologically complex higher-order response such as bistable switches. The outcomes of the proposed research will also lead to fundamental understanding of robustness and tunability of biological switches regulated by cis-antisense transcription, which will be of interest to biologists as well as engineers investigating complex biological gene networks. The educational goals will include development of mentorship program to train high school students, workshops for freshman and sophomore students to expose them STEM careers, development of research screencasts utilizing available technological tools, as well as performing assessments to promote diversity and increase enrollment of women in science."

One very well characterized interaction in proteins that provides structural stability is the hydrogen bond (H-bond), which is a type of electrostatic interaction formed between protein backbone atoms that have opposite polarity and positioned in a structurally accessible manner. This project investigates the role of an additional and previously underappreciated type of stabilizing interaction in proteins, H-bonds between backbone atoms of sequentially adjacent amino acids. This project will use an experimental approach that relies on the use of carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds to visualize specific protein vibrations to investigate energetic contribution of this type of H-bond in protein stability. The interactions that define a protein's folding, structure, and stability are all important factors in activity and function, thus research to identify and quantify novel types of interactions have the potential to impact basic research into all aspects of protein science. This project will provide education and training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students by involving them in every aspect of the project. <br/><br/>H-bonds formed between backbone N-H donor and CO acceptors have long been appreciated as dominant forces underlying protein structure and stability. However, many residues within proteins adopt conformations with phi and psi values of approximately 90 and 0, respectively, which are traditionally considered forbidden due to a steric clash between the amide nitrogen (Ni) and that of the following amino acid (Ni+1). This project will investigate the (Ni+1)-H---(Ni) interactions formed within these conformations which constitute a previously underappreciated type of H-bond.  The objectives of this project is to focus specifically on determining the stabilization mediated by the (Ni+1)-H---(Ni) H-bonds in R67 DHFR. This project will compare the stability of the protein with its (Ni+)-H---(Ni) H-bonds intact with that of an isosteric CH2 analog [wherein one or more of th(Ni+1)-H---(Ni) H-bonds are disrupted]. In addition, model systems will be used to generate a calibration curve that will enable an interpretation of the shifts in IR spectra observed with the protein in terms of stabilization. Successful completion of the objectives will provide a convincing demonstration that (Ni+1-H)---(Ni) H-bonds are formed, and importantly, will provide a gauge of their contribution to protein stability."

RNA editing involves specific alterations of RNA molecules, relative to the genes from which they were copied, and affects expression of genes in mitochondria, the organelles responsible for energy generation in the cell.  Whereas, RNA editing is widespread in many organisms, including humans, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  This research will fill that knowledge gap and provide new insights how RNA editing occurs.  The project will also provide training opportunities at many levels through concerted efforts to involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  One such effort will be to continue ongoing work with a high school teacher and students to develop experiments that can be done in an inner city school setting.  Specific outreach to women and minority students will help broaden participation in science. Students will take part directly in the research, gaining valuable experience by learning how to optimize methods, master state-of-the-art techniques, and present the results of their work as part of the project's dissemination of the research outcomes to the broader scientific community.  <br/><br/>RNA editing occurs in many organisms and has been most extensively studied in humans and other mammals, plants, and human pathogens. Observed sequence changes include base conversions, base substitutions, the deletion of encoded nucleotides, and the insertion of additional residues. The only organism known to carry out all of these forms of editing is the primitive eukaryote Physarum polycephalum. The sequence of virtually all of the mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs encoded in Physarum mitochondria differs from that of the mitochondrial genome in highly specific and reproducible ways. Many RNAs contain so many non-encoded nucleotides that their genes escaped identification for years. Previous work has shown that ""extra"" nucleotides are added to these RNAs during their synthesis and that the specificity of editing depends on template elements that flank editing sites; however, the underlying mechanism is still mysterious. The major aim of this project is to identify the factors that are required for these site-specific changes to mitochondrial RNAs. Previous work on two different forms of editing has narrowed the list of potential candidates for each type and these will be investigated further. The expression of each of these proteins will be knocked down individually and mitochondrial RNAs will be analyzed to determine whether RNA editing levels are reduced. Once editing factors are identified, their interactions with other mitochondrial proteins will be examined. Long-term goals for the project include the development of an in vitro system assembled from defined components for use in mechanistic studies and the definition of the specific roles played by both template elements and auxiliary factors. Successful completion of these studies will significantly enhance current understanding of how RNA sequence changes can be targeted in an exquisitely specific manner."

Amazingly, the mixture of many thousands of different proteins in a bacterial cell is a self-organizing system. This is accomplished by the production of molecular scaffolds, which are large, three-dimensional, porous networks that attach to specific target proteins and group them into cooperative networks. The placement of these scaffolds at defined locations within the cell provides a basic form of bacterial anatomy. Although bacterial scaffolds have major influences on cell physiology, relatively little is known about their structure and function, and a major goal of this project is to understand scaffolds and their interactions with target proteins at a molecular level. A second goal is to understand how scaffold networks are different among related species that exhibit large variations in cell anatomy. This will provide novel insight on how the plasticity of scaffold networks facilitates the evolution of new bacterial species. The concept of exquisite organization within cells relates directly to the broader impacts of the project, which will come from the construction of a visually stunning interactive microscope exhibit that will be viewed by thousands of young children at the Children's Museum of Cheyenne, Wyoming.  <br/><br/>Many bacteria become organized by assembling polymeric protein scaffolds that recruit groups of regulatory proteins into cooperative networks. Although these scaffolds have major influences on bacterial physiology and cell organization, relatively little is known about their structure and function.

This will be the first comprehensive study of a bacterial scaffold interface, with mutational analyses that will provide a precise level of detail. (ii) Understand how the three-dimensional structure of the PopZ scaffold influences network assembly and the kinetic properties of the PopZ-binding proteins moving within it. This will be the first study to relate the three-dimensional geometry of the scaffold to its function within the cell, and will include novel mathematical models of particle movements based on empirically determined biophysical parameters. (iii) Connect changes in the PopZ amino acid sequence to changes in cell organization during the evolution of new species. This will be the first study to compare PopZ networks between species that have large differences in sub-cellular organization, and will test the hypothesis that scaffold networks provide a relatively promiscuous binding surface that facilitates evolutionary change. This project also emphasizes broader impacts that extend beyond basic science. In creating a unique and interactive live cell microscopy exhibit at the Children's Museum of Cheyenne, the investigators will inspire future generations of scientists by impressing them with the inherent beauty of sub-cellular organization."

Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) are a class of proteins that have emerged as key regulators of a multitude of plant signaling pathways. These proteins are currently a focus of intense research due to their involvement in modulation of many agronomically important traits such as seed yield, plant defense responses, symbiosis and nitrogen use efficiency. The mechanistic details of how a small number of proteins regulate a multitude of signaling processes remain largely unknown. This research focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of G-proteins and will address some of the unique features of plant G-protein signaling, which remain undiscovered to date. Successful completion of this research will not only fill major gaps in our knowledge of plant G-protein signaling mechanisms, but will also build a foundation for further targeted studies in other economically important plants, where detailed mechanistic studies are currently not possible. Therefore, in addition to advancing the basic understanding in the field, this study may also apply broadly to some of the problems that challenge the world today, such as generating higher yield with limited resources and unfavorable environments. The work will involve training of a technician and a postdoctoral scientist in multidisciplinary approaches, as well as mentoring of undergraduate students. The research will also help promote an understanding of plant science to high school students and the general public via a series of hands on experiments and interactive presentations.<br/><br/>Naturally occurring or engineered changes in the level of G-proteins cause profound effects on plant architecture, abiotic stress responses and yield potential, making elucidation of their underlying signaling mechanisms a high priority. The principal investigator has shown that the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein and a phospholipase D (PLDalpha1) protein act in a double negative loop to precisely control the level of active G-alpha protein in plant cells. The research will now focus on predicting and validating specific G-protein regulatory circuits using biochemical modeling and mutant response assays. Evaluation of the ancestral versus derived states of the G-protein regulatory modes will also be investigated by comparative evolutionary and genetic analyses.  This research seeks to answer important questions related to plant G-protein regulatory mechanisms such as, (i)  how is the plant G-protein cycle regulated, especially in the context of its unusual biochemical properties? (ii) how is the specificity of response regulation achieved despite a paucity of core components? (iii) how the activation/deactivation balance of G-alpha protein cycle is controlled in the absence of canonical G-Protein-Coupled Receptors in plants? (iv) why is the loss of a key regulatory protein (e.g. RGS protein) tolerated in a subset of plant species, even though it acts as an important regulator of the G-protein cycle in plants that possess it? and (v) what might replace RGS protein function in plants that lack it? Successful completion of this research is expected to not only shed light on G-protein signaling in plants, but to uncover additional, perhaps novel signaling and regulatory pathways in other eukaryotes that have been obscured until now due to the complexity of interactions."

The project will not only shed light on the fundamental biology of viruses, but also on the physics of tightly confined DNA and the regulation of biological molecular motors which transport DNA.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in the application of physics techniques to biology research and new experimental laboratory course materials will also be developed. K-12 outreach activities will be conducted and grade-school educational materials, including science books, kits, and games, will be evaluated for quality and scientific accuracy to provide online recommendations to schools and museums.<br/><br/>Recent studies have shown that the kinetics of the packaging of double stranded DNA in bacterial viruses is dominated by the dynamics and energetics of the tightly packed DNA. In the biological regime to be studied, with repulsive DNA-self interactions, the DNA relaxes only very slowly towards an equilibrium conformation. Large forces build that resist DNA confinement and later help drive ejection during infection of a host cell. Bacteriophage phi29 will be studied as a model system and the packaging of single DNA molecules will be directly measured with optical tweezers. The dependence of packaging kinetics on initial motor velocity, dependent on ATP concentration, will be studied. Lower initial velocity is hypothesized to reduce formation of highly unfavorable DNA conformations, yielding decreased heterogeneity in the dynamics, lower relative slowing during filling, and less motor pausing, slipping, and stalling. A hypothesis to be tested is that allosteric regulation of the portal motor helps packaging complete as fast as possible by throttling down the motor velocity to mitigate formation of unfavorable DNA conformations. How packaging kinetics, force, and DNA relaxation depend on temperature and ionic conditions will also be studied. Motor velocity increases significantly with temperature, and motor slowing during filling depends on ionic screening conditions. Whereas faster initial velocity may cause greater relative slowing during filling, increased temperature or ionic screening may accelerate DNA relaxation.  How packaging conditions and aging affect DNA ejection and viral infectivity will also be studied. Conditions affecting the DNA conformation during packaging, and aging, may impact DNA ejection. Conditions that increase forces resisting packaging or decrease DNA relaxation time may enhance ejection. The biological impact of these parameters will be investigated by examining their effects on virus infectivity."

To cope with this ""feast or famine"" uncertainty, cells have evolved processes that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). This project utilizes a single-celled reference organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas, to investigate how molecular switches that govern proliferation and quiescence are controlled and how they are coordinated to ensure that they don't interfere with each other. Microorganisms like these can accumulate large quantities of valuable compounds, e.g. oils, but only when starved. It is anticipated that knowledge about the molecular switches governing transitions between the states of proliferation and quiescence will allow predictions about how these states can be controlled and engineered. Thus, newly discovered details about these molecular switches provide potential engineering strategies to uncouple high yields of valuable compounds from starvation responses. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the two research locations will collaborate to identify and model the interactions between key regulators of quiescence and proliferation that have counterparts in many other species including plants and animals. The diversity of approaches and quantitative training components prepare the trainees for science careers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to gain a predictive understanding of how nutrient and metabolic cues are integrated into coherent decisions that control life cycle state transitions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two nuclear protein complexes, CHT7-C and RB-C, have been identified that govern the transitions between nutrient-deprivation induced quiescence, cell growth, and commitment to cell division. It is hypothesized that the quiescence regulator CHT7-C, and the cell cycle commitment regulator RB-C form an interlocking transcriptional network that coordinately controls cell growth and division responses to nutrient or metabolic cues. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize purified CHT7-C and RB-C complexes in order to define their subunit composition and modifications under different life cycle states; (2) Identify CHT7-C and RB-C target genes followed by generation of a transcriptional network model to observe common nodes that functionally couple the two complexes; (3) combine mutations affecting different components of the two complexes into isogenic lines to obtain synthetic phenotypes that provide insights into function and interrelation of the two complexes in vivo; and (4) build a testable logic switch model and develop quantitative markers to test and revise the model. The collaborative approach taken for studying the interactions between quiescence and cell proliferation regulators is aimed at transforming the understanding of the networks that establish and maintain coordinated global responses to metabolic and nutritional cues."

The project will not only shed light on the fundamental biology of viruses, but also on the physics of tightly confined DNA and the regulation of biological molecular motors which transport DNA.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in the application of physics techniques to biology research and new experimental laboratory course materials will also be developed. K-12 outreach activities will be conducted and grade-school educational materials, including science books, kits, and games, will be evaluated for quality and scientific accuracy to provide online recommendations to schools and museums.<br/><br/>Recent studies have shown that the kinetics of the packaging of double stranded DNA in bacterial viruses is dominated by the dynamics and energetics of the tightly packed DNA. In the biological regime to be studied, with repulsive DNA-self interactions, the DNA relaxes only very slowly towards an equilibrium conformation. Large forces build that resist DNA confinement and later help drive ejection during infection of a host cell. Bacteriophage phi29 will be studied as a model system and the packaging of single DNA molecules will be directly measured with optical tweezers. The dependence of packaging kinetics on initial motor velocity, dependent on ATP concentration, will be studied. Lower initial velocity is hypothesized to reduce formation of highly unfavorable DNA conformations, yielding decreased heterogeneity in the dynamics, lower relative slowing during filling, and less motor pausing, slipping, and stalling. A hypothesis to be tested is that allosteric regulation of the portal motor helps packaging complete as fast as possible by throttling down the motor velocity to mitigate formation of unfavorable DNA conformations. How packaging kinetics, force, and DNA relaxation depend on temperature and ionic conditions will also be studied. Motor velocity increases significantly with temperature, and motor slowing during filling depends on ionic screening conditions. Whereas faster initial velocity may cause greater relative slowing during filling, increased temperature or ionic screening may accelerate DNA relaxation.  How packaging conditions and aging affect DNA ejection and viral infectivity will also be studied. Conditions affecting the DNA conformation during packaging, and aging, may impact DNA ejection. Conditions that increase forces resisting packaging or decrease DNA relaxation time may enhance ejection. The biological impact of these parameters will be investigated by examining their effects on virus infectivity."

This research addresses when and where this contractile system is activated and what other potential proteins may regulate this activity.  To answer these questions, the research team will use a cell-based system to study the morphogenesis that occurs during development, coupled with computational approaches that will allow for the discovery of new proteins that may play a role in regulating the cytoskeleton, non-muscle myosin II, or both.  This research will uncover how this crucial process, morphogenesis, is regulated while also producing computational tools that can be broadly applied to other research questions in the community.

What is also lacking is a complete list of the molecules involved in the regulation filament dynamics and contractility. The objective of this project is to dissect the recruitment and activation of NMII through the analysis of a novel NMII regulatory molecule RN-tre. With RN-tre as an example, the project will identify additional regulators of NMII contractility during apical constriction, a critical morphogenic process. Drosophila tissue culture cells will be used to establish an in vitro apical constriction assay by taking advantage their sensitivity to RNAi depletion and confined geometry, making them ideal for high-resolution imaging techniques such as total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF). This project will also develop a computational framework for prioritizing candidate NMII regulators, enabling the testing of the predicted proteins using the apical constriction assay.  Along with furthering the understanding of how the critical developmental process is regulated, this project will also produce valuable computational tools that can help answer other complex biological questions.  The results of these studies will advance knowledge in the fields of cell and developmental biology by extending our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate NMII contractility."

The particular hypothesis being tested in this work is the possibility that the viral genome can engage with the ribosomal machinery and have its genes expressed even as the capsid protecting it remains intact. Several single-virus-particle methods will be used in attempts to catch an end of the genome as it fluctuates out of the intact capsid and initiates its gene expression (translation into protein products).

To be able to perform such important functions, extracellular materials must be deposited very precisely, but how cells achieve such precision is mostly unknown. A beautiful example of an extracellular structure with a very precise deposition is the wall surrounding plant pollen. Pollen grains from different species often look remarkably different, in part, because wall materials are deposited at some places on pollen surface and absent from the others. The places where pollen wall is absent are called apertures, and these structures help pollen perform its reproductive function. Across species, pollen apertures often differ in shape, number, and positions, but within a species aperture patterns are usually the same. Using formation of pollen apertures as a model, this project will investigate how cells determine which surface areas will lack extracellular structures and how positions of such areas are marked. Understanding pattern formation in the context of pollen will provide insight into pattern formation during many developmental processes.  In broader impacts of this project, several young scientists will be trained and the results of the work will be communicated to larger audiences through lectures in an Arts & Science undergraduate course, microscopy courses, and by interacting with middle- and high-school students during biology enhancement workshops and a Capstone internship program.<br/><br/>How cells develop precisely defined domains of extracellular structures is an important and poorly understood question. Pollen grains provide an excellent model for studying this problem, as their surfaces are covered by the cell wall, exine, which assembles into diverse species-specific patterns. This wall protects sperm cells within the pollen grains and plays several other important roles in plant reproduction. In addition to the exine-covered areas, pollen surfaces of most plant species have characteristic openings, or apertures, where exine is absent or reduced. This indicates that, in the course of pollen development, specific domains are formed on pollen surface, which are reliably recognized by the cell wall deposition machinery as different from the rest of the surface and which will become apertures. As is the case with exine patterns, apertures often vary greatly across species, differing in their number, positions, and morphology, yet within each species their patterns are under tight developmental control. As well-defined, tightly regulated, and easily recognizable and quantifiable structures, apertures provide an attractive handle for addressing the complex problems of pollen surface pattern formation and can serve as a powerful model for generation of distinct extracellular domains, a process important in a wide variety of cells and organisms. Through a variety of genetic, cell-biological, and computational methods and using Arabidopsis pollen as a model, this project aims to discern how the aperture-specifying domains are formed and to define cell-biological events important for aperture development. This will allow creating a paradigm for how plant cells generate functionally distinct peripheral domains, and how cell wall deposition machinery interprets these domains to generate extracellular differences."

The regulation of these two processes modulates the number of mRNA molecules and, hence, protein levels within the cell.  Therefore, modulating mRNA levels directly affects both cellular structure and behavior.  Recently, a third process that affects mRNA levels was discovered, i.e. that cells can transfer and share mRNA molecules between themselves. However, the implications of intercellular mRNA transfer upon neighbor cells are still poorly understood. Thus, there is an immediate need for a quantitative analysis to better understand this novel process. Characterization of this process is performed using state-of-the-art microscopy and biochemical techniques. The main goals of this project are: 1) to develop tools for live imaging of this process, 2) to determine the scope of this process, 3) to decipher the molecular mechanism that performs and regulates this process and 4) to define the physiological consequences of this process. <br/><br/>It was found that mRNA molecules transfer between cells, through structures that are called membrane nanotubes (i.e. long, thin tubes that connect cells). The quantitative analysis suggests that 1-5% of the mRNA molecules in cells actually come from ""donor"" cells. However, there is much that is still unknown. In this project, a live imaging system will be developed to visualize mRNA transfer for the first time in living cells. Second, the scope of this process will be determined, e.g. how many RNAs undergo transfer and what is the efficiency thereof? This will be performed by co-culturing human ""donor"" and murine ""acceptor"" cells, followed by separating them by flow cytometry. After the cells are separated, their mRNA content will be analyzed by RNA-seq techniques and the scope of human mRNAs that transferred to murine cells will be revealed. In addition, we will verify the scope of RNA transfer by fluorescence microscopy using multiplex single-molecule Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (smFISH). Proteins involved in mRNA transfer will determined using RNA affinity purification to isolate those that bind the transferred mRNA and by assessing the effects of mutation of the suspected candidates in cells. Last, but most important, a series of biochemical, imaging and cell biology assays will be performed in order to determine if the transferred mRNAs are being translated into proteins in the acceptor cells, and affect their physiology. Deciphering the process of mRNA transfer through membrane nanotubes and its consequences will further our understanding of its role in controlling local cellular environments with respect to tissue development and maintenance along with the cellular responses to stress. We will also gain an understanding of how membrane nanotubes are formed and deliver materials, and our aim is to also develop new tools and techniques for mRNA imaging and to establish an open database of transferred RNAs. <br/><br/>This research was funded by a joint Israeli and United State program in which the NSF provides funding for the US laboratory, located at Albert-Einstein School of Medicine in New York, while the Israeli BSF provides funds for the Israeli lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot."

Indeed, cellular compartmentalization by a surrounding membrane has been studied in detail for decades. In contrast, another type of cellular compartment that lacks a membrane is common but less well-studied.

We hypothesize that proteins interacting with several diverse natural regulators are likely to have larger pools of RNA partners compared to proteins that interact with conserved regulators. To investigate this we will first use in vitro approaches to compare the RNA interaction pools of ribosomal proteins from different organisms. The protein-interacting RNAs that are derived from this approach will then be assessed to determine what additional features are necessary to allow regulation in response to protein over-expression within cells.

Undergraduates will have the opportunity to participate in a summer exchange Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program between Mississippi State University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the PIs will develop an exhibit with scientific demonstrations for the NC Science Festival targeted to elementary and middle school students. <br/><br/>The project employs the plant Arabidopsis as a model to elucidate the contributions of the proteolytic pathways mediated by TOP1 and TOP2 thimet oligopeptidases through integrated biochemical, proteomics, and systems biology approaches. Unique methods have been utilized in the preliminary studies to characterize the interaction of thimet oligopeptidases with the plant stress hormone salicylic acid. Genetic and biochemical experiments uncovered roles for TOPs in pathogen defense as possible ""redox sensors"". Fundamental differences between TOP1 and TOP2 cellular functions have been revealed experimentally and captured in a cell-level computational model. The research will expand on these findings by addressing the following aspects: (i) characterize redox-specific modifications mediated by and regulating TOP1 and TOP2, (ii) identify the substrate repertoire of TOP1 and TOP2, and (iii) expand and verify predictive models bridging molecular and structural characteristics of TOP1 and TOP2 with the whole-cell response. Upon the successful completion of the proposed research, a framework for TOP signaling in plants will be established and provide critical insights into how the interplay between proteolytic pathways and defense hormone signaling can be harnessed for the benefit of adaptation and tolerance mechanisms of crops.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the NSF EPSCoR Program."

The ability of retrotransposons to increase their copy number has ensured their success as invaders of host cell DNA in organisms from yeast to primates. The potentially mutagenic activity of retrotransposons is tightly suppressed in most cells, except those that divide asymmetrically, including stem cells and cells of the single-cell organism, brewer's yeast. Asymmetric cell division produces two cells with different potential, one with the capacity for self-renewal and the other with the capacity to perform specialized functions. A key requirement for asymmetric cell division is that each of these cells inherit a specific centrosome. The centrosomes comprise two intracellular bodies onto which chromosomes are anchored. Migration of the centrosomes, each with their complement of chromosomes, to opposite ends of a dividing cell ensures that chromosomes are equally distributed between the two cell products of cell division. The research outlined in this project stems from the investigagtor's discovery that stress-triggered retrotransposon activity in brewer's yeast interferes with the typical pattern of centrosome inheritance. The project will determine how the activity of retrotransposons influences the inheritance of a specific centrosome by the self-renewing cell and differentiated cell, and explores the consequences of disrupting the normal pattern of centrosome inheritance on chromosome segregation, cell division and the production of two cells with different potential. This research aims to explain how events occurring in single cells can influence the reproductive capacity and lifespan of the entire populations. The Broader Impact activities will include extensive laboratory-based training for a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, a high school student and also an undergraduate student to participate in the project each summer, with priority given to underrepresented minorities from institutions with limited research opportunities. The undergraduate research opportunity will focus on building self-identification as a research scientist, regardless of gender or racial representation in science.<br/><br/> Many types of asymmetrically dividing cells, including embryonic and germline stem cells, neural progenitors and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have a canonical pattern of centrosome or spindle pole body (SPB) inheritance that intrinsically regulates the orientation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome segregation and the capacity of cells to self-renew. Remarkably, these same asymmetrically dividing cell types are also permissive for the activity of retrotransposons, although host defense mechanisms usually hold retrotransposons in check to maintain the integrity of asymmetric cell division. It is not known how unleashing retrotransposon activity compromises asymmetric cell division. While examining the inherent asymmetry of nucleocapsid assembly sites of the Ty1 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the principal investigator's laboratory discovered that derepressing Ty1 activity substantially perturbs the canonical pattern of SPB inheritance. The goal of this project is to understand how Ty1 retrotransposon activity influences SPB inheritance and how the resulting alterations in SPB inheritance affect spindle orientation, chromosome segregation and the self-renewing potential of yeast cells. Protein-protein interaction assays will be used to investigate the mechanism of cross-talk between Ty1 nucleocapsid components and SPB components, particularly the coiled-coil SPB assembly protein,  Spc42. Moreover, genetic and environmental manipulation of Ty1 retrotransposon activity and quantitative fluorescence microscopy-based assays of single cells will probe potential correlations between post-transcriptional steps in retrotransposition and (a) the SPB inheritance pattern, (b) the orientation of the mitotic spindle, (c) chromosome transmission fidelity, and (d) the replicative potential of mother and daughter cells. This research addresses a critical question that has not been addressed in the scientific literature previously: can sites of retrotransposon nucleocapsid assembly sequester host proteins with essential roles in SPB assembly to alter spindle orientation and the maintenance of differential cell fates by asymmetric cell division? Research to address this question will provide new insights into the relationship between retrotransposon activity and cell division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These regions are known as cellular domains. How cells direct molecules to specific positions and produce such domains is poorly understood. Pollen grains provide a beautiful example of a cells' ability to precisely form domains on their surfaces. Pollen surface is typically covered by a protective structure, pollen wall exine. However, in the majority of plants, certain regions on the pollen surface do not receive deposition of exine and instead develop into characteristic gaps, the apertures. To produce apertures, developing pollen consistently marks future aperture sites as different from the rest of the surface and protects them from exine deposition. This project will investigate molecular mechanisms through which pollen creates aperture domains. In the course of this project several young scientists (a postdoc as well as graduate and undergraduate students) will be trained. In addition, pollen biology will be used as a tool to engage and educate the general public through a variety of platforms, including activities at a local science museum, arts class, and a botanical garden.<br/><br/>Formation of distinct cellular domains is critical for cell functions, but the mechanisms involved in creating these domains are still poorly understood. Pollen provides an excellent model for studying these mechanisms. In most plant species, the outer cell wall of pollen grains, called exine, is deposited on the pollen surface non-uniformly, with certain surface areas excluded from exine deposition and developing into characteristic openings, the apertures. Existence of apertures indicates the presence of tightly controlled mechanisms used by developing pollen to specify cellular domains. In this project, the roles of several aperture genes recently discovered in Arabidopsis will be studied to understand the mechanism of aperture formation. Through a variety of genetic, imaging, biochemical, and computational methods, the proposed work will define cell-biological and molecular events involved in this process. It will also explore the questions related to the evolution of pollen aperture diversity and will characterize molecular players that could be responsible for the interspecies similarities and differences in the process of aperture formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such regulatory RNAs have been found to exist naturally in many organisms, but they have been used in a relatively limited number of bacteria as a tool to regulate gene expression. In this project, the investigators will develop generalizable RNA regulators that can be used to understand and engineer diverse biotechnologically important bacteria. Specifically, design principles for antisense RNA (asRNA), one of the common regulatory RNAs in bacteria, will be determined to provide biologists and bioengineers with predictable RNA tools for gene regulation. Additionally, this project is broadly impactful by cultivating the next generation. Multiple graduate students will be trained to perform the interdisciplinary project. Moreover, our outreach program will introduce state-of-the-art synthetic biology RNA tools to high school teachers, and provide them with teaching kits that will be used in their classroom, broadening student participation in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to determine quantitative design principles for asRNAs and provide a generalizable model that enables predictably tunable asRNA-mediated gene repression in diverse organisms. asRNA is one of several types of small regulatory RNAs, and it represses gene expression by binding to its target messenger RNA. Although this binding occurs following the simple RNA base-pairing rule, predictably tunable asRNA-mediated repression is still challenging. The most important design parameters for asRNA in Escherichia coli DH10B have been identified by using three target reporter genes in plasmids. A predictive model for asRNA-mediated repression, which relates repression efficiency to the identified parameters by a multiple linear regression analysis, will be developed. To demonstrate the generalizability of this model, three specific aims are proposed. First, the model developed with plasmid reporters in E. coli DH10B will be validated by expanding it to chromosomal gene targets. This task will allow for testing of forward-designed asRNAs in different genetic contexts. Second, the predictive model will be tested in three different bacterial species. This task will test the hypothesis that asRNA design principles are consistent among diverse bacteria. Third, the model will be further validated by building and testing additional asRNAs. A user-friendly online version of the model will also be developed to provide a way to collaboratively advance this RNA-based technology."

To counteract daily stresses, and to maximize energy storage during the day, plants developed complex regulatory circuits that can predict daily (circadian) and seasonal (photoperiodic) rhythms, thus providing an evolutionary advantage and improved organism fitness. As such, plant circadian rhythms control all facets of plant growth and development, including flowering times, photosynthesis, latitudinal species distribution, and resistance to drought, cold and pests. It is estimated that greater than one third of all plant genes are under circadian control and that proper day-length measurements are imperative to the maintenance of plant growth, reproduction and crop yields. How these circadian clocks measure and adapt to a wide array of environmental signals is poorly understood. This is particularly the case for adaptation to daily and seasonal variations in the quality and quantity of environmental light. The current proposal aims to use a multidisciplinary approach to model how plants sense and adapt to changes in the intensity of blue-light in a given environment. Aside from gaining fundamental understanding of the chemical processes that govern plant photobiology, the project is likely to provide new avenues to improve crop yields and biomass production for renewable energy, and develop novel varieties of plants that are more drought and pest resistant.  The project will provide unique training opportunities for undergraduate students and outreach to local science teachers and K-12 students.<br/><br/>How Light-Oxygen-Voltage proteins integrate environmental cues is poorly understood. The proposed research leverages recent discoveries of new signaling mechanisms that delineate adaptive responses to environmental stimuli. The concerted chemical, biophysical and synthetic biology approach will provide quantitative understanding of adaptive responses in complex signaling networks. The primary technical objectives are three fold. 1) A combination of chemical kinetics and predictive mathematical models will be developed to gain a systems level understanding of Light-Oxygen-Voltage protein function in seasonal and daily clocks. A direct result of these efforts will be a detailed understanding of how multiple chemical inputs to Light-Oxygen-Voltage protein function dictate signal transduction and optogenetic tool development. 2) The project will use the new understanding of Light-Oxygen-Voltage protein signaling networks to design synthetic gene circuits in mammalian cells, and thus enable the testing of the understanding of the network in the absence of extraneous plant proteins that may affect signal transduction. 3) The ultimate goal is to combine this understanding to guide the construction of new Arabidopsis thaliana strains that exhibit altered circadian function and plant flowering periods to demonstrate how Light-Oxygen-Voltage protein chemistry is essential for triggering systems-level adaptive changes in a plant system."

Genetically identical populations of cells can use random, stochastic expression of genes to diversify their response and hedge against this uncertainty. However, when environmental changes are slow and can be sensed and responded to, there is little need for a diversified response. This raises a fundamental question as to how cells reconcile these two potentially contradictory demands: the need to use phenotypic diversity to anticipate stress and also employ well-defined deterministic responses. Achieving this requires gene regulatory networks that are tunable, switching between stochastic and deterministic responses depending on environmental conditions. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that interlinked positive and negative feedback (""mixed feedback"") networks, can provide this type of tunable response. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy and microfluidic experiments supported by mathematical modeling, this project will quantify the tunability of synthetic and natural mixed feedback circuits and will test how cells handle time-varying environments. This work is significant because it will reveal genetic mechanisms that allow otherwise identical cells to choose random fates in some circumstances and exhibit deterministic responses in others, allowing organisms to cope with environmental uncertainty.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research plan is integrated with an outreach program focused on systems and synthetic biology education at the community, high school, and undergraduate levels: First, through a partnership with ECHO Science Center in Burlington, Vermont, the PI will produce a special summer exhibit and talk aimed at communicating cutting-edge systems and synthetic biology topics to community audiences.

Proteins are the molecular machines that carry out the work of cells and give cells their identities. It is not clear what causes the amount of protein that cells make to differ between individuals. It is known that this can be caused by differences in how much RNA is made.

This project defines a new biological function during hyphal network formation for a class of oxidative enzymes, termed polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs), that play a role during signaling, chemotropic interactions and cell wall remodeling during somatic cell fusion in filamentous fungi. Previously, this class of enzymes has only been associated with extracellular degradative capacities, providing a paradigm shift in the cellular function of this class of proteins. The discovery of a role for copper-dependent PMOs in cell signaling, along with the characterization of new substrates for these enzymes, will greatly impact this field of research; genes encoding PMOs have been found in human and plant pathogens and may also be involved in symbiotic relationships. This project brings expertise on cell signaling, cell biology and genetics with deep expertise in biochemistry and structural biology on PMOs, and provides an excellent training opportunity for undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral associates. Workshops will be developed on the use of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa to identify and characterize molecular players involved in cell-cell communication and fusion in collaboration with educational science organizations and will form the basis of an intensive three-week undergraduate course at the University of California - Berkeley. Live cell imaging movies from this project and others will enrich educational aspects on the role of fungi in the environment in exhibitions provided by the Mycological Society of San Francisco and the Bay Area Mycological Society. <br/> <br/>Chemotropic interactions between fungal germlings (or hyphae in a colony), initiates cell communication, followed by a switch from cell growth to cell wall breakdown and membrane merger at the contact point between adhered cells. A role for a predicted PMO, HAM-7, is required for chemotropic interactions and functions through the cell wall integrity (CWI) MAP kinase signaling pathway in filamentous fungi. Strains lacking ham-7 fail to undergo cell fusion and thus lack an interconnected hyphal network. The ham-7 gene and its relatives form a unique clade among PMOs in fungi. The substrate for the HAM-7 PMO is currently unknown and defining the activity of HAM-7, its substrate and role in chemotropic interactions and cell fusion using biochemical methods, structural biology, cell biology and genetics is a major objective of this project. A second PMO, CWR-1, which is predicted to use chitin as a substrate based on homology, functions as a negative regulator of the switch from cell growth to cell wall disassembly during cell fusion. A predicted membrane protein, CWR-3 is required for CWR-1 to function in cell wall disassembly, suggesting it may function as a receptor for the product of the CWR-1 enzymatic activity. This project will link the function of polysaccharide monooxygenases oxidative capacity with the enigmatic properties of chemical languages involved in germling/hyphal communication that dictates the behavior of cells seeking to undergo vegetative fusion with their own kind. The work described in this project will be transformative in defining new biological roles for this class of enzymes/proteins that may be broadly applicable to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species that encode PMOs in their genomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project will probe how the genetic material of a specific plant virus form an unusual structure that is able to initiation the production of proteins (a process called translation) in the host cell.  There is a potential to use information from this research not only to control viruses but also to develop systems for production of proteins that are nutritionally beneficial, protein antibodies or proteins that have economic uses. At a more fundamental level, because of similarities in translation, this knowledge may be relevant to other major viral diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV and West Nile. Because of their relatively small size and well-defined components, plant viruses serve as a model system to increase the understanding of more complex viral and cellular translation.  This project will provide excellent training for students from high school through graduate school in both biochemical and quantitative measurements. Many of the students involved in research in the past have been from underrepresented minority groups and this is likely to continue in the future.  These students will contribute to a diverse and well trained workforce in science and technology. This project will also involve high school teachers and community college faculty.<br/><br/>When an RNA virus infects a cell, it must out-compete host cell mRNA to produce viral proteins.  Viruses accomplish this by a number of strategies, many involving unique viral RNA structures. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) contains an unusual RNA structure (a BTE) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA. In preliminary results, it was shown that the BTE binds ribosomes, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  The details of this novel mechanism of protein synthesis initiation are unknown. This project will investigate three critical steps in assembly of an initiation complex. These include 1) determining the rate-limiting steps for 40S/43S ribosomal subunit binding to the 3' BTE of BYDV; 2) analysis of ribosome transfer to the 5' UTR and 3) 3' BTE and 5' UTR interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy will be used to determine the effects of each of the isolated proteins on ribosomal subunit binding.  The site of ribosome transfer at the 5' UTR and the rates of scanning and influence of eIFs on those rates will be measured by FRET techniques.  In a novel application of single molecule fluorescence, the rate of transfer of the 40S ribosomal subunit from the 3' UTR binding site to the 5' UTR will be determined. The BYDV 5'-3' RNA interaction appears to be transient and it is therefore difficult to elucidate the effects of the complex on ribosomal subunit transfer.  To further quantitate these interactions, the related, but much more stable interaction of the carnation Italian ringspot virus 5'-3' UTRs will be used.  The experiments described here will increase understanding of the molecular interactions that allow viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentration of cellular RNA for translation."

For example, genes regulated by parental genomic imprinting (PGI) are silenced either maternally or paternally (depending on the gene) after fertilization.  PGI has been characterized in mammals and seed plants, and in both cases has been linked in part to the regulation of maternal resources available to the offspring.  Using the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana, it has been found that plants isolated from different regions can promote strong increases in seed size depending on whether they are used as mothers or fathers in crosses.  This might further suggest that parental bias for resource allocation, or the even selection of imprinted genes themselves, is subject to variation in natural populations. This project aims to identify the genes involved in these parental effects using recombinant inbred (RI) lines, which are genetic chimeras of two initial parents, and mapping populations that carry visual markers for maternal gene expression.  In addition, seed development will be characterized at the cellular level to better describe the developmental outcomes of variation in imprinted or parentally-biased systems. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. This project seeks to identify seed size genes that may function in short-term adaptive strategies for genomic regulation, accounting for some trait variation between Arabidopsis ascensions. This aspect is directly translatable to novel breeding strategies in agriculture.  This project will also aim to advance education at the boundary of biology and mathematics. The RI lines employed are uniquely suited as a classroom tool to bridge basic genetics and physiology with computational methods. A learning module has been created to conduct publishable RI research in the Plant Genetics and Diversity course at Rhodes College. Resources will be generated from these course materials allowing educators at both the university and high school level to employ RI systems in the classroom.

First, findings from this project will impact future breeding of rice, which feeds half of the world's population. Second, scientists at both Oregon State University and University of California in Davis will be trained in multi-disciplinary areas by participating in the discovery-oriented research. Third, this project contains light microscopy-based short courses and hands-on training opportunities for underserved students, which will stimulate their interests in STEM disciplines. In addition, to increase public awareness of cutting-edge research programs, plant motor proteins will be included as living examples in advanced light microscopy workshops for high school and community college science teachers.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project is aimed at investigating how OsKCH2, a plant-specific kinesin in the rice plant Oryza sativa, enables the crosstalk between microtubules (MTs) and filamentous actins (F-actins) at the cortical division site and how it regulates cell division. Kinesins are motor proteins that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to power numerous essential cellular processes such as transporting cargos along MTs and organizing/remodeling physiologically important MT-based arrays. OsKCH2 belongs to the group of Kinesins with a Calponin Homology domain (KCHs) in high plants. KCHs are known to crosslink MTs and F-actin in vitro, but their functions in plant growth and development remain poorly understood. The project is based on several critical preliminary findings including: (1) mutations in OsKCH2 caused a dwarfism phenotype, (2) OsKCH2 is specifically associated with the PPB during early stages of mitosis, (3) OsKCH2 directly binds to and transports F-actin on microtubules in vitro, and (4) OsKCH2 is the first minus end-directed Kinesin-14 to demonstrate processive motility as a single dimer.  This project will use a multi-disciplinary approach to address two objectives: (1) dissecting the regulatory mechanism underlying the processive motility of OsKCH2 using in vitro single-molecule imaging, and (2) interrogating the in vivo functions of OsKCH2 in cell division and plant growth by examining phenotypes linked to a null kch2 mutation."

The work employs interdisciplinary approaches that can be widely employed for making rapid progress in understanding the functions of poorly understood cell division genes and mRNAs.  The Broader Impact activities include a public outreach component in which microscopy images generated from this research will be used to create a moveable 20-foot scientific art installation called ""Genetic Reflections"". This piece will be installed in a public, high-traffic area in the UW-Madison Biotech Center and then the Wisconsin Science Museum. Portions of this installation will be constructed to travel locally around the state of Wisconsin and then nationally. The goal is to have scientific artwork that is beautiful, informative and promotes future public engagement projects between scientists and the public.<br/><br/>In certain cells types, midbody factor mis-regulation and midbody accumulation leads to altered growth and development, suggesting that the factors (proteins and mRNAs) associated with midbodies when mis-handled by the cell, can lead to dramatic and detrimental proliferative and cell fate changes. Necessary reagents, techniques, and datasets will be generated and shared, providing the foundation to determine how midbody-associated mRNAs are regulated during cell division. With such knowledge, it will be possible to probe the dynamics of midbody-specific mRNAs during mitosis. The PI has made an unexpected preliminary discovery in the midbody transcriptome of an enrichment of the mRNA of an important kinesin widely known to function on the protein level. This discovery challenges current understanding of the mechanisms of molecular motor regulation and transport, and also likely cytokinesis.

Our human bodies contain trillions of cells. These cell building blocks are so tiny that over 1500 of them would fill a layer the size of the period at the end of this sentence. However, every animal living on Earth has developed from a single, exceptionally large cell, the egg. This large size is important for early development to proceed properly. We are studying the way in which the mother animal's body creates such big cells. We already know that this requires helper cells to donate their contents to the growing egg, via stable connections. Our ongoing research is on the maintenance of the stability of the window-like connections between helper cells and the egg. We are also studying how the connections are closed at the right time, so that the egg is finally autonomous. Education and outreach activities will include mentoring of K12 teachers, development and engagement of 2nd grade students in development, a math-biology hands on lab for undergraduates, and a novel approach for matching trainees with scientists and engineers.   Also included are efforts to broaden participation of URM students and women in science.<br/><br/>The archetypical animal cell has one nucleus. However, in diverse organisms, this rule is broken by tissues such as syncytia. Syncytia are specialized tissues that contain multiple nuclei connected to a common cytoplasm via intercellular bridges. Syncytia are found in diverse contexts such as fruit fly egg chambers, filamentous fungi, mammalian muscle myotubes and plant seeds. In many animals, the egg- and sperm-producing organs are syncytial, and the maintenance of intercellular connections is essential for fertility. Our central aims are to determine the composition, dynamics and regulation of intercellular bridges that connect developing oocytes (egg cells) to a common syncytial cytoplasm. For the propose studies, the model system will be the egg-producing syncytium of the tiny free-living nematod worm, C. elegans. Egg production in the C. elegans syncytial germline is well described genetically and developmentally but has only begun to be explored with cell biology. The small size and transparency of C. elegans make it amenable to quantitative high-resolution in vivo imaging. In addition, quantitative image analysis, photo- and micro-manipulation, biochemistry, reverse genetics and corroborative modeling will be combined to study intercellular connections. C. elegans is highly suitable for dissecting molecular mechanism due to its well-annotated genome and the ease of protein depletion, and genome editing for fluorescent protein tagging. Syncytial intercellular bridges can be thought of as abortive cell division, wherein the cytokinetic ring failed to separate the daughter cells. Therefore, our vast knowledge about how cells pinch in half during cytokinesis has informed hypotheses about the structure and function of intercellular bridges. The high conservation of cell division machinery predicts our findings will be applicable across phylogeny. Furthermore, the conveyor belt-like arrangement of oocyte development from the distal to the proximal gonad will reveal spatio-temporal correlations that predict causal relationships."

This project seeks to develop design principles for enzyme engineering, using properties of the protein structure that can be computed. This project builds on very recent discoveries that reveal new information about how nature builds the catalytic center of a protein molecule, wherein multiple layers of amino acids within the protein structure provide the necessary properties that enable chemical reactions to happen within living organisms at physiological temperature and under mild conditions. Many of these same reactions, when performed in a laboratory or industrial setting, require high temperature and caustic conditions. An important, ultimate goal of this work is to be able to design protein catalysts to perform industrial chemical reactions, because for most industrial chemical processes, there is no natural enzyme that can serve as a catalyst. The development of such protein catalysts for industrial use will translate to less energy usage, lower costs, less waste, and fewer unwanted by-products. Thus the ability to design protein catalysts has many potential benefits to the environment, to the economy, and to human well-being. This project will train doctoral students and undergraduate research interns, including members of underrepresented groups, to become highly qualified scientists in the areas of biochemistry and computational biology; the cultivation of such expertise is vital to the regional high-tech economy and to U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. <br/><br/><br/>This project will explore how distal residues contribute to enzyme catalysis, establish additional principles about their role in catalysis, and take the first steps toward using these principles for enzyme design. The project takes a multilateral approach, combining theory, computation, biochemical experiments, x-ray crystal structure determination, x-ray solution scattering, and high-field electron spin resonance spectroscopy. These simulations and experiments will provide information about the electrostatic, structural, and dynamic effects of amino acid residues, including remote residues, on catalysis. The specific examples to be studied in this project, a Y-family DNA polymerase DinB and an aldolase, were chosen because they lead into - and provide insight into - protein design problems. The effects of distal residues on proton transfer equilibria in the active site, and the associated requirements for catalysis, will be investigated. Study of the roles of individual residues in Y-family DNA polymerases will increase understanding of the mechanism of extension in DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA. The results will be used to address whether improved extension capability can be engineered into the polymerase DinB. Investigation of the interactions between residues in a natural aldolase will increase understanding of its catalytic mechanism; the emerging principles will be used to improve activity of an artificially designed retroaldolase. New features to address the problem of enzyme design, namely the predictability and importance of distal residue participation in forging the right catalytic properties and the use of coupled protonation states, are introduced. The capability to design enzymes that can catalyze any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge in science. This project will develop design principles to build on the knowledge base that is necessary to create such enzymes. Enzyme design principles to be developed and tested in this project thus have potential impact on biotechnology, environmental remediation, agriculture, and the growth of a ""green"" economy, as well as the chemical industry."

Improved biofilm models are crucial to understanding how they function. Across biology, chemistry, and materials research, measuring parameters of chemical, physical, and mechanical properties is key to understanding how complex assemblies function. In this project, experiments are designed to achieve breakthrough discoveries needed to transform biofilm descriptors from vague terms like ""glue"" and ""slime"" to scientific and quantitative descriptions based on chemical composition and molecular architecture by using high resolution techniques. The self-assembly of these macromolecular architectures by bacteria also inspire us to use or build such mechanically robust molecular frameworks for new functions.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will engage in broad dissemination of scientific research and educational outreach activities. She will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, including many from groups under-represented in STEM; design coursework changes to introduce more quantitative concepts into biochemistry courses; and lead comprehensive outreach activities, engaging students, teachers, and the general public. Major specific activities include: (i) developing a biochemical biofilm laboratory module for the high-school science curriculum with assistance from a high-school teacher who joins the PI's laboratory each summer, (ii) integrating exploratory-based lab modules in undergraduate laboratory courses to encourage true engagement and the hands-on ""a-ha"" moments that enhance learning; (iii) assisting in the mentoring of incoming first-generation and under-represented undergraduate students in preparation for university coursework in STEM; and (iv) sharing engineering protocols for a custom-built active-control feedback system to stabilize NMR pulse power levels over long acquisition times, enhancing the stability of NMR experiments and also of general value in spectrometer monitoring. Overall, the commitment to educational and scientific outreach in this project integrates research with teaching, mentoring, and K-12 outreach activities to inspire and empower others to impact and improve the society.<br/><br/>In this project, amyloid fibers produced by E. coli, known as curli, will be studied. Curli mediate bacterial adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation. This project will provide unprecedented detail into the atomic structure and function of native curli fibers and will map their interactions with amyloid dyes and their cognate biofilm polysaccharide partners by integrating unique solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) strategies to measure atomic-level distances together with super-resolution microscopy to examine the larger-scale spatial arrangement of curli and other components in the biofilm. This project is jointly funded by Molecular Biophysics and Cellular Dynamics and Function Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Proteasomes are protein complexes inside all plant and animal cells that degrade damaged proteins to prevent their toxic aggregation. Such damage can arise from physical stress; however, such stressors may also inhibit proteasome activity. Thus, the focus of the research will be to understand how plants reprogram their cellular activities during proteasome inhibition. A better understanding of plant responses to environmental stress may ultimately improve crop yield and food security. The project will allow the training of twelve undergraduate students at Coastal Carolina University.  Students with physical disabilities will participate in the research, and will strengthen the ties between the College of Science and Office of Accessibility and Disability Services; this collaboration may serve as a model to other universities seeking to increase this group?s participation in STEM disciplines.  As this project integrates both research and teaching, it will also facilitate the revision of a laboratory-based class that will serve to strengthen the curriculum. <br/><br/><br/> This research investigates plant proteasomes, which avert cytotoxicity by safely removing damaged proteins that result from stress.  However, severe oxidative stress decreases proteasome activity in plants, and this project aims to identify mechanisms that contribute to its impairment. In contrast to yeast and mammalian models, the effects of proteasome inhibition in plants are not understood.  This project intends to address this gap in plant biology by examining how cellular processes are altered in response to proteasome inhibition.  Respirometry, biochemical, and -omic approaches will be used to reveal if proteasome inhibition coordinates metabolism to restore amino acid levels or adjust antioxidant metabolism.  The outcomes of the study will describe differences in how plants respond to proteasome inhibition compared to mammalian and yeast cells."

The generation of two identical daughter cells requires not only that each cell receives an equal complement of  genetic material (DNA) but also that the other contents of the cell be divided equally. The process of physically separating the two daughter cells is known as cytokinesis, and this process involves a contractile ring that physically constricts the cell and splits it in two. Cytokinesis utilizes many of the same mechanisms that are used to regulate cell shape change during migration. Cell shape is dependent on a dynamic structure (the cytoskeleton) that is comprised primarily of the protein actin, and whose behavior is regulated by a number of small signaling molecules. Several conflicting models have been proposed to explain how these small molecules interact to control the cytoskeleton, but the explanatory power of these models has not been clearly established. This project will investigate the regulation of the cytoskeleton by these small  signaling molecules and help to clarify the mechanisms by which they function.This research will provide training and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented minorities including Native American Indian and  Hispanic students. Outreach into high schools will also be performed with the intent to generate in students a long-term interest in science. <br/><br/>In this project, a toolbox of molecular and pharmacological reagents will be combined with biophysical measurements and high-resolution light and electron microscopy to examine how the G proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 coordinate cytokinesis-related shape change in large embryonic cells. Aims 1 and 2 will use a combination of live cell imaging and biophysical analyses to determine what elements of Rac and Cdc42 signaling antagonize Rho-dependent cytokinesis. Aim 3 will take advantage of a unique preparation of the contractile ring to both define its 3D structure and determine how the different elements of Rho signaling contribute to its assembly and function. The results of these studies will advance knowledge in the field of animal cell division research by extending our understanding of the precise 3D architecture of actin and myosin II in the contractile ring that drives cytokinesis."

The tips of these chromosomes, named telomeres, play especially important roles in protecting the integrity of the genetic information. Telomeres can be likened to aglets, the metal or plastic caps at the tips of shoelaces; when the aglets are missing, the shoelaces (chromosomes) become frayed and fall apart. Paradoxically, the DNA at telomeres is difficult to maintain during the process of chromosome duplication, which occurs each time a cell divides. Many protein molecules, working together are required to ensure the proper maintenance of telomere DNA. This research will utilize a variety of techniques to investigate how these protein molecules work together, how they interact with one another, and how these interactions are regulated to promote telomere integrity. The study will be carried out using a fungus called Ustilago maydis, which is easy to manipulate and has telomere features that are shared by many animals. This research will also train many undergraduate students and a postdoctoral student, allowing them to acquire the technical and critical thinking skills necessary for future careers in science. The undergraduates will be recruited from Hostos Community College, an institution that serves primarily under-represented minority students. Training these students will benefit society by promoting a more diverse scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that protect and stabilize the ends of chromosomes. Telomere DNA is maintained through periodic addition of a repetitive sequence by a special reverse transcriptase named telomerase. A key function of the telomere nucleoprotein complex is to allow the cells to distinguish normal chromosome ends from double strand breaks by suppressing inappropriate DNA repair. However, repair proteins paradoxically help to promote telomere maintenance in two circumstances. First, telomerase-negative cells can utilize an aberrant recombination/repair mechanism (called ALT) to add telomere repeat tracts onto chromosome ends. Second, in telomerase-positive cells, multiple recombination repair factors promote the maintenance of telomere tracts by enhancing telomere replication (e.g., by stabilizing stalled forks or surmounting replication barriers). We showed recently that both of these functions of repair proteins at telomeres can be faithfully reproduced in Ustilago maydis, a model fungal system for studying fundamental cellular processes. Moreover, we discovered in U. maydis several conserved and functionally significant interactions between telomere proteins and repair factors. Consequently, we are poised to address how the direct physical interactions between telomere and repair proteins channel the enzymatic activity of repair factors to promote telomere maintenance while suppressing aberrant repair. This is a level of regulation that has not received detailed examinations. We have also uncovered in U. maydis two duplex telomere binding proteins with distinct functions and interactions with repair proteins. We will therefore examine how the telomere and repair proteins co-evolve through comparative analysis of these factors in different fungi.<br/>Objectives and Methods:<br/>1) Use binding and activity assays to define the molecular basis of telomere-repair protein interactions and examine how the interactions affect the repair activities of these proteins in vitro.<br/>2) Use genetic and cell-based assays to determine the mechanisms and function of the telomere-repair protein interactions in promoting telomere replication and ALT in vivo.<br/>3) Characterize the properties of duplex telomere-binding protein homologs in budding yeast and Ustilago to determine the evolutionary path of duplex telomere-binding proteins and their interaction with repair factors in fungi.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phages are ten times more abundant than their bacterial hosts in every environment tested, and thus they profoundly impact the bacterial communities in all environments. Although much research is currently focused on investigating bacterial defense systems in isolation, research activities in this project will examine whether bacterial immune systems act with other cellular processes to maximize the efficiency of defense. In this project, Staphylococcus bacteria and their phages, both abundant residents of human skin, will be used as a model host-virus system. Educational activities designed to stimulate interest in science will provide hands-on research experiences to undergraduates and high school students through a phage discovery course. Undergraduates will also gain early exposure to cutting-edge genome editing tools and techniques. The research has the potential to inspire novel biotechnologies and the educational activities are expected to promote participation of underrepresented groups in STEM careers.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to gain fundamental insight into defense and counter-defense mechanisms in S. epidermidis and its phages as a model system. CRISPR-Cas are an important class of adaptive defense systems that use small RNAs and Cas nucleases to destroy invading phages. Many staphylococci naturally possess Type III (CRISPR-Cas10) systems, which are among the most widespread in nature. Although recent research has shed light on the canonical immunity pathway of the model CRISPR-Cas10 system in S. epidermidis, the question of whether or not CRISPR-Cas10 relies upon other (non-Cas) pathways to carry out defense was never posed. Preliminary work in the PIs lab has discovered unexpected interactions between CRISPR-Cas10 and two conserved cellular pathways previously considered unrelated to immunity. These observations support the central hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas10 integrates with other cellular pathways, including other immune systems in S. epidermidis, to carry out defense. This integration in turn impacts the corresponding phage-encoded mechanisms of counter-defense. Research in this project will test this hypothesis by using a combination of biochemistry, genetic, and molecular biology approaches to 1) characterize molecular interactions between CRISPR-Cas10 and other cellular pathways, 2) determine the molecular mechanisms by which newly discovered immune system(s) operate, and 3) characterize phage-encoded mechanisms that counter these defenses. The new insights gained by this research are expected to form the basis for biotechnologies that can be used to shape and control natural Staphylococcus communities."

The extraordinary synthetic capability of the protein biosynthesis system has driven extensive efforts to harness it for societal needs in areas as diverse as energy, materials, and medicine. For example, recombinant protein production has transformed the lives of millions of people through the synthesis of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. In nature, however, only limited sets of protein monomers are utilized, thereby resulting in limited sets of biopolymers (i.e., proteins). Expanding nature's repertoire of ribosomal monomers could yield new classes of enzymes, therapeutics, materials, and chemicals with diverse chemistry. In the short term, this will expand the genetic code in a unique and transformative way. In the long-term, knowledge gained will allow researchers to diversify, evolve and repurpose the ribosome and the entire protein synthesis system to generate non-natural polymers as new classes of sequence-defined, evolvable matter. This proposal will also promote interdisciplinary education, including the specific expansion of STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women. Students will be trained to integrate principles from genome engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology. As a form of outreach, the investigators will create experiential learning modules that bring synthetic biology research to K-12 and undergraduate classrooms and connect students to the science being done at our institutions. This new outreach program will ensure that advances made in this project benefit a broader community and will contribute to motivating and training young scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators seek to repurpose the translation apparatus for making new proteins containing multiple mirror-image D-alpha-amino acids.

This framework will be instrumental in sustaining the much-anticipated transformation in expanding the range of genetically encoded chemistry in living systems, with the potential for significant breakthroughs. For example, understanding the structural and substrate flexibility of the protein synthesis machinery may provide insights into life's origin and also lead to general rules for engineering protein synthesis to meet societal needs. From an engineering perspective, the research could enable scalable mirror image polypeptide synthesis, opening the door to cheaper and more effective peptidomimetic enzymes, materials, and drugs, and expanding the scope of synthetic and chemical biology. In sum, it is expected that this project will provide new directions for academic and industrial enterprises related to engineering translation, while simultaneously training the next generation of scientists and engineers to be full participants in the work force."

It is expected that beneficial microbes can support plants to be resilient to stresses in the environment, such as drought. However, it is not well understood how microbes are recruited to the root during stress or which members of the diverse soil microbial community are most responsive during stress. This research will investigate how microorganisms respond to plant hormones that signal stress. Understanding the dynamic relationships between soil microbes and plants during stress is important for anticipating, and potentially managing, expected changes in plant performance given environmental and land-use changes. This project will assess how soil microorganisms alter their growth and activities when exposed to plant hormones, quantify how the molecules released from roots change during stress and assess the responses of microbes to those changes, and determine how members of soil microbial communities collectively respond to plant stress signals in natural and controlled environments. This work has broad significance for understanding plant resilience, with expected outcomes of national interest for agriculture and land management, food and energy security, sustainability, and general soil health. It will also benefit society by providing quantitative scientific workforce training and community outreach at Michigan State University's Science Festival and other public campus events.  <br/><br/>The objective of the research is to understand the rules of assembly and function of the rhizosphere microbiome given exposure to plant hormones that signal stress. For plants, root microbiome recruitment and assembly is facilitated through the soil, which provides the physical, chemical, and biological context for plant-microbiome engagement. Soil harbors a rich reservoir of microbial diversity, but up to 80% of microorganisms in soil are dormant and have inaccessible functional potential. When plants are stressed, they release metabolites into the soil that could serve as signals to microorganisms. This research aims to: 1) uncover bacterial responses in growth and resuscitation to stress phytohormones; 2) to quantify microbial community dynamics and interactions given plant stress signals; and 3) to identify members of complex soil microbial communities that resuscitate and assemble to the rhizosphere during stress. A multi-scale approach will be used that combines in vivo quantification of bacterial responses to phytohormones, synthetic microbiome construction and manipulation, and in situ experiments of rhizosphere microbiome dynamics in soil. This research is expected to decipher rules governing microbiome dynamics when plants are stressed. A foundational understanding of the interactions between plants, microorganisms and the environment will facilitate management of microbiomes towards desired functions, and will support goals towards sustainable agriculture and food and energy security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The platform is called Gulliver. It will allow unprecedented access to the largest reservoir of biological and chemical novelty on the planet; microbial species that have so far evaded attempts to utilize their potential. This will open up a possibility to transform the knowledge of microbial biology, revolutionize discovery of bioactive compounds and even detect life outside of our planet.  Fully developed, Gulliver will be a discovery device so simple it will require no special skills to study properties of new species, opening a way to serve as an educational and research tool in high schools and undergraduate labs. Its development will create opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate training at a cross-section of biology, material science and nanotechnology. <br/><br/>In this project the investigators will build a prototype of Gulliver, which represents Stage 1 of the development of the ultimate device.  At this stage, Gulliver will be a chamber with membranous walls, with nanometer-sized (?feeding?) pores. Standard polycarbonate membranes are excellent for the purpose and are available off-the-shelf. One ""entry"" pore will be different, with a diameter close to the size of a bacterium (0.6-1.5 m). This pore will be custom milled using ion gun technology, with alternative technologies available as Plan B. Once Gulliver is deployed to an environment, the entry pore will allow a single microbial cell to enter the inner space of the chamber, blocking the entry.  Feeding pores will allow diffusion to bring in the naturally occurring nutrients and growth factors, enabling that cell to multiply, colonize the chamber and form a pure colony inside it. In this way, Gulliver will be able to grow and isolate species with unknown nutrient requirements, which is the majority of microbes in the biosphere. This Stage 1 project will test the concept of Gulliver autonomously ""sampling"" single cells from the environment, enabling their growth as pure cultures. In future Stages 2 and 3, the investigators will equip Gulliver with various nanosensors that will monitor and measure aspects of microbial growth, enabling for the first time metabolic studies of individual microbial populations as they grow in nature.  Note that Gulliver does not require any human participation at any stage of microbial isolation/growth. The device can be pre-made and deployment into an essentially any habitat, be it deep ocean, animal gut, or extraterrestrial bodies."

Why is sexual reproduction so common despite its costs? Are there significant evolutionary consequences of asexual reproduction? What are the effects of sexual reproduction or its absence on the evolution of genes and genomes? Despite decades of study, these and related questions remain unanswered. Established genetic model systems such as fruit flies and yeast have provided important insights into the genetic and genomic consequences of sex and recombination.  However, these systems are limited because they do not offer the ability to make direct comparisons between sexual and asexual organisms--and their genomes--from the same natural populations with similar genetic background and environmental history. This project will use a different organism, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand snail, which has both sexual and independently-derived asexual lineages that make it ideally suited to address fundamental evolutionary questions of how genes and genomes evolve in the absence of sexual reproduction. This research will take advantage of the unique strengths of P. antipodarum and extend them to the genomic level, generating novel insights into the genetic consequences of sexual reproduction and its absence. Analyzing sexual and asexual lineages will make it possible to catch mutation accumulation and gene loss in the act. This research will also provide key steps forward in developing P. antipodarum into a powerful model system for many important biological questions, from host-parasite dynamics to ecotoxicology. Since a key unique element of sexual reproduction is the rapid generation of genetically diverse offspring, research outcomes will also illuminate the extent to which the preservation of genetic diversity within populations, species, and ecological communities is integral to the preservation of biological diversity. <br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The research will provide numerous opportunities for student training and career development in evolutionary biology, molecular genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics.

The aim of this project is to understand how the local environment (e.g., the environment in the host) affects pheromone signaling and bacterial behaviors such as colonization. This project combines molecular-based microbiology methods with physical and mathematical tools to develop a more complete experimental and theoretical picture of this process. The project will enhance education by training graduate and undergraduate students to perform cross-disciplinary laboratory research. These research experiences will prepare the students for a wide range of careers in the biosciences. The project also includes a formal training experience for secondary science teachers, primarily from high schools with large numbers of students from under-served populations. <br/><br/>The most important elements of Vibrio fischeri pheromone signaling are the LuxI/LuxR signal-synthase/receptor, which produces and detects a 3OC6 homoserine lactone (HSL) pheromone, and the AinS/AinR synthase/receptor system, which employs a C8 HSL pheromone to drive a different signaling cascade. The complexity of these systems is enhanced by the crosstalk generated by LuxR's recognition of both HSL signals, by the fact that both Lux and Ain are modulated in response to the environment, and by the presence of positive feedback in both the Lux and Ain cascades. The primary goal of this project is to understand how the system gathers and integrates information from its environment. The specific aims are to (i) understand how the pivotal regulator LuxR and its variants integrate information from the two HSL signals, (ii) identify the activation states of the broader pheromone-signaling circuitry and explore how environmental inputs lead to specific outputs, and (iii) test the hypothesis that the architecture of this signaling system allows spatially-heterogeneous environments to trigger population-wide responses over extended distance and time scales. The project will use cytometry and gene reporter methods to characterize LuxR interactions and system states. It will also use microfluidics and microscopy to explore signaling dynamics in heterogeneous environments. The results are expected to yield new insights into how bacteria use environmental cues to control population-level behaviors."

Like all eukaryotes, the life of plants depends on the function of specialized structures, known as organelles that populate the subcellular environment. An essential organelle, whose function and morphology are largely conserved across eukaryotes, is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This project seeks to understand how the ER establishes and maintains its functional and morphological identity. As the ER is at the core of the cell's biosynthetic machinery, and because significant variation in ER biology exists among eukaryotes, studying the ER within model plant systems provides an essential foundation to improve plants as primary providers of useful biomolecules and to support life on this planet. This project on the Arabidopsis ER will also provide new fundamental knowledge that will influence the study of other organisms that share mechanisms underlying ER biogenesis with plants. In addition, it will provide societal benefits through education of the next generation of scientists, engagement of high-school students and teachers in research, and by communicating discoveries in plant science and their impact on the society through outreach activities.<br/><br/>A central question in cell biology is how organelles establish and maintain their identity. Due to its rich, mutable morphology, the ER is a wonderful model to explore this question. The ER adopts an intricate web-like architecture via cytoskeleton-driven remodelling and anchoring of subdomains to the plasma membrane (PM). However, the mechanisms underlying ER shape as well as differentiation and function of ER-PM subdomains are largely unknown, especially in plants. The research will capitalize on the discovery of novel components of the Arabidopsis proteome that control ER morphology and interaction with heterotypic membranes, including the PM. Using a suite of advanced live-cell imaging approaches, functional genomics analyses and mathematical modeling, the project will characterize a novel plant ER shaper, define the molecular composition of the ER subdomains interacting with the PM and determining how such subdomains influence the biosynthesis and deposition of the extracellular matrix. The results will help create a new paradigm of plant ER structure and function. Since ER integrity and function are inextricably linked and the ER presents species-specific features, this research promises to significantly advance basic understanding of plant ER architecture and function, and provide a framework for comparative insights into ER biology among eukaryotes."

To cope with this ""feast or famine"" uncertainty, cells have evolved processes that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). This project utilizes a single-celled reference organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas, to investigate how molecular switches that govern proliferation and quiescence are controlled and how they are coordinated to ensure that they don't interfere with each other. Microorganisms like these can accumulate large quantities of valuable compounds, e.g. oils, but only when starved. It is anticipated that knowledge about the molecular switches governing transitions between the states of proliferation and quiescence will allow predictions about how these states can be controlled and engineered. Thus, newly discovered details about these molecular switches provide potential engineering strategies to uncouple high yields of valuable compounds from starvation responses. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the two research locations will collaborate to identify and model the interactions between key regulators of quiescence and proliferation that have counterparts in many other species including plants and animals. The diversity of approaches and quantitative training components prepare the trainees for science careers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to gain a predictive understanding of how nutrient and metabolic cues are integrated into coherent decisions that control life cycle state transitions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two nuclear protein complexes, CHT7-C and RB-C, have been identified that govern the transitions between nutrient-deprivation induced quiescence, cell growth, and commitment to cell division. It is hypothesized that the quiescence regulator CHT7-C, and the cell cycle commitment regulator RB-C form an interlocking transcriptional network that coordinately controls cell growth and division responses to nutrient or metabolic cues. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize purified CHT7-C and RB-C complexes in order to define their subunit composition and modifications under different life cycle states; (2) Identify CHT7-C and RB-C target genes followed by generation of a transcriptional network model to observe common nodes that functionally couple the two complexes; (3) combine mutations affecting different components of the two complexes into isogenic lines to obtain synthetic phenotypes that provide insights into function and interrelation of the two complexes in vivo; and (4) build a testable logic switch model and develop quantitative markers to test and revise the model. The collaborative approach taken for studying the interactions between quiescence and cell proliferation regulators is aimed at transforming the understanding of the networks that establish and maintain coordinated global responses to metabolic and nutritional cues."

The investigator's laboratory has discovered that ceramide is critical for the function of motile cilia in green algae and mammalian cells. The investigator's research will now determine the mechanism by which ceramide regulates motile cilia. An essential part of this project is the inclusion of graduate and undergraduate students and their education in evolutionarily conserved mechanisms.

Yet, the process of translation and its impact on cellular physiology is generally thought to be subordinate to transcriptional regulation and post-translational signaling. This notion continues despite the fact that both transcription and signaling depend on proteins, and hence on translation. This project seeks to identify a universal aspect of gene expression and physiology that has been overlooked.  This project will test the novel idea that proteins needed under particular environmental conditions are preferentially translated when exposed to such conditions.  The proposed studies may uncover a new molecular mechanism for gene regulation and will greatly advance our understanding of the unifying, central role of translation in controlling a myriad life processes.  In addition, the project will contribute to training of K-12 students and teachers, and high school science curriculum development. <br/><br/> The proposed research will address whether functional diversity of components of the translation system and their transcriptionally generated modular expression regulate large-scale physiological state transitions in organisms. The underlying hypothesis is that environment-dependent physiological cell states are generated by the conditional production, assembly, and activity of distinct ribosomal complexes with variable subunit compositions. This hypothesis is based on the intriguing organization of translational machinery genes within gene regulatory networks of phylogenetically diverse organisms. Specifically, ribosomal subunits and other translation system proteins are conditionally co-regulated as multiple distinct, yet overlapping modules with un-correlated expression patterns across environmental shifts. The proposed research will attempt to observe conditional association of certain ribosomal subunits, and whether this association directs the translation complex to preferentially translate transcripts encoding functions for a particular environment-relevant physiological state. Protein (using SWATH mass spectrometry) and mRNA (with RNA-seq) compositions of ribosomal complexes will be characterized across environmental shifts (e.g., aerobic to anaerobic) that effect large physiological state transitions. Additionally, the proposed research will predictably manipulate the physiological state of each organism by engineering environment-responsive regulation or knock outs of conditional ribosomal subunits. Altered regulation of specific conditionally expressed ribosomal subunits should manifest an inappropriate physiological state transition relative to the environmental shift. Generality of the hypothesis will be assessed by performing studies using model microorganisms from the three domains of life - H. salinarum (archaeon), E. coli (bacterium), and S. cerevisiae (eukaryote). These proposed activities will demonstrate whether variable translation complexes drive environment-dependent physiological transitions."

This study will provide invaluable information on gene expression in T. ammonificans grown under chemical and nutrient conditions that reflect, as closely as possible, those encountered in its natural environment and will provide insight on gene regulation and expression in response to changing environmental conditions. This study is anticipated to help reconstruct the ancestral and acquired metabolic traits of this deep-branching organism and shed light into the emergence and evolution of autotrophic carbon fixation pathways."

This project addresses the mechanism of how Sen1 protein is implicated in transcription coupled DNA repair (TCR) in the model organism budding yeast. Sen1 is a homolog of human senataxin, a protein implicated in ataxia-ocular apraxia-2 (AOA2) and an autosomal dominant form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4). Given the fact that the DNA repair mechanisms are highly conserved, the findings generated from study of the yeast protein are likely to be applicable to other species including human. In addition to scientific advancement on an important DNA repair mechanism, the project will have a significant impact on education, enabling graduate and undergraduate students to acquire research experience and proficiency in yeast genetics and molecular biology. Relevant new methods and findings from the project will be shared with the scientific community and presented in classrooms, local science fairs and at national and international scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The TCR pathway of DNA repair has been known for almost 30 years. However, the underlying mechanism of TCR is still poorly understood because of its complexity, especially in eukaryotic cells. Recent findings suggest that Sen1 plays a more direct role in this pathway than the well-known TCR factor Rad26. This project has 3 objectives that build on this significant finding. Objective 1 is to determine the implications of the interactions of Sen1 with Rad2, a single-stranded DNA endonuclease, and with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), during TCR. A method that allows unambiguous mapping of direct protein-protein interactions in living yeast cells will be utilized to confirm and systematically define the interactions. Objective 2 is to determine the functionality of the minimal essential region of Sen1 (Sen1-MER) in TCR. In addition to its ATPase-helicase activity and nuclear localization function, the relatively large (~ 900 amino acid residues) Sen1-MER may interact with DNA, nascent RNA and certain proteins. It is likely that Sen1-MER also plays an important role in TCR. TCR-deficient Sen1-MER mutants will be isolated and characterized, and the effects of overexpression of Sen1-MER on TCR will be analyzed. Objective 3 is to determine how Sen1 and Rad26 interplay with TCR repressors to regulate transcription bypass of DNA lesions and modulate stalling and/or disruption of the RNAP II complex at DNA lesions for repair. This comprehensive analysis is expected to provide detailed insights into Sen1 and its function in TCR."

To accomplish the goals of the research, a team of students comprised of undergraduates, doctoral students and postdoctoral associates will be trained to carry out a range of projects focused on a cell membrane located molecule, called FERONIA, known to play key roles in diverse aspects of plant growth and survival. These projects will provide them with training in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology, the basics of how cells and organisms function, which will enhance their ability to emerge as teachers and researchers. Workshops offering hands-on exposure to experiments related to the project and compatible to a high school laboratory will be offered to teachers in STEM who will also be offered further mentoring to encourage incorporation of some of the materials into their classroom exercises or discussions. Topics related to the research area will be incorporated into a teaching effort that fosters skills in science writing to inform the public. Together these activities should broaden society's pipeline for future scientists as well as improve public awareness of the scientific inquiry process and the importance of its products. Moreover, FERONIA is conserved among plant species; the knowledge and research materials generated by this project should stimulate interest and facilitate similar inquiries in agriculturally important crops and in efforts to ensure vibrant growth of plants in their native habitats, including under harsh conditions, thus with the potential to impact global issues such as food production and a sustainable ecology. <br/><br/>Research supported by this award focuses on understanding how FERONIA, from the model plant Arabidopsis, controls a broad array of processes critical for plant growth, development and coping with environmental stresses. FERONIA belongs to a class of molecules called receptor kinases, which play key roles in sensing changes outside the cell and translating these signals to stimulate cellular responses appropriate for the incoming signals. Although the importance of receptor kinases has long been established in plants by voluminous research, the diverse functional roles carried out by FERONIA is striking and how it is accomplished remains puzzling. The goal of this project is to determine how FERONIA orchestrates what must be a complex network of biochemical and cell biological processes needed to execute its functions. In particular, the project seeks to elucidate a core signal transduction pathway capable of serving as a hub with which the various FER-regulated processes might be integrated. This core pathway, referred to as FER/LLG-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP, is comprised of FERONIA receptor kinase, its functional partner, a lipid-modified protein anchored on the cell membrane called LLG1, and their immediate cellular target ROPGEF, which activates key cytoplasmic signaling molecules, called RAC/ROP GTPases. Biochemical and microscopy-based experiments will be carried out in plants grown under normal growth conditions and when challenged by an environmental growth regulatory signal, a small peptide hormone called RALF1. Experiments are designed to examine how these molecules interact, the cellular and molecular consequences of these interactions and how they together might lead to various plant growth responses regulated by FERONIA. Together, results from this research should provide insight towards the mechanistic underpinning of how FERONIA mediates its diverse functional roles whereby furthering our knowledge about strategies employed by organisms for growth and survival."

In particular, the project will investigate a feature of eukaryotic cells called lysosome-related organelles (LROs), by using genetic approaches in a single celled organism called Tetrahymena thermophila.  The project will significantly enhance the tools that are available to perform advanced genetics using Tetrahymena, and will allow students at several different levels to be trained in using those tools.  While the project is focused on using these genetic tools to understand one aspect of cellular organization in Tetrahymena, the findings will be highly relevant to broad questions about how cells in general have become specialized to perform their many functions.  In addition, the tools that are being developed can be applied in the future to probing a wide array of cellular features.  Findings from this project may lead to patenting and commercialization of genetic modifications to Tetrahymena, to make this organism a more efficient tool for commercial production of proteins and lipids. The project will involve students from a wide variety of backgrounds, including students from groups that are currently under-represented in science. <br/><br/> The project will hone a forward genetic approach to dissecting the biosynthesis of LROs. LROs are ubiquitous and heterogeneous eukaryotic organelles that provide a very wide range of functions in cellular physiology and intercellular communication, and whose evolution appears to have been a major driver of diversification in the secretory pathway. The project will enhance the understanding of mechanisms involved in LRO formation, by identifying genes required for this pathway in Tetrahymena.  The approach takes advantage of a high-throughput screen to isolate Mendelian mutants, following chemical mutagenesis, that are defective in LRO formation. Those mutants will be characterized using cell biological and classical genetic approaches. Following that analysis, the mutant genomes will be sequenced, after employing an outcross and backcross strategy to generate pools of F2 meiotic segregants from each initial mutant. By taking this strategy, one can greatly simplify the problem of identifying the causative mutation in each mutant, and thereby identifying the gene required for LRO formation in that strain. It is anticipated that approximately 10 mutants will be analyzed in this fashion, to the level of identifying the causative genetic lesions."

In humans, cyclophilins play key roles in numerous signaling pathways, are involved in viral life cycles for viruses such as HIV, and play roles in inflammation and cancer.  Recently, this family of proteins has been identified as RNA-binding proteins, and subsequent studies suggest RNA regulates the activity of this important family of proteins.  These findings provide a wholly new avenue of study to understand how cyclophilins are regulated and how they regulate key cellular processes important in health and disease. The goal of this research project is to identify the specific RNA molecules to which these proteins bind, what that binding interface looks like, and to determine the role(s) of these interactions in cyclophilin biology. This research program will have a broad impact on the scientific communities interested in cyclophilin and RNA biology and lead to the development of tools that will benefit studies by others that seek to understand the full array of RNA/protein interactions. This program also strongly promotes teaching, training and learning while advancing scientific discovery. These activities occur through well-designed and thoughtful mentoring strategies as well as through significant teaching innovations in the undergraduate classroom, including development of active learning environments and introduction of research-based labs in introductory science courses.<br/><br/>It is becoming apparent that many proteins are regulated by RNA in unforeseen ways. The cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) is consistently revealed as a non-canonical RNA-binding domain in every unbiased mammalian and yeast in vivo cross-linking study reported to date. Cyclophilins are a key cellular regulator and play important roles in numerous biological pathways. Their discovery as RNA-binding proteins suggests novel roles for RNAs in cyclophilin biology which have been hinted at by other observations, but as yet have not been fully explored. Targets include the CLD of cyclophilin A (CypA), a well-studied representative of CLDs that consists solely of this domain, and its yeast homolog Cpr1. Cyp33 was also selected for study because it contains both an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and CLD domain. RNA motifs responsible for interacting with the CLD will be identified initially by using in vitro selection strategies. In vivo binding sites will be identified using in cell photocrosslinking followed by pull down and deep sequencing of the associated RNAs. The mechanism of RNA activated CLD enzymatic activity will be elucidated. An unbiased transcriptome analysis in the absence of CLDs will reveal whether the transcripts found to be associated with CLD are directly impacted in vivo. The in vitro binding and enzymatic strategies employed will facilitate the development of a set of highly validated separation-of-function mutants. These tools will allow the correlation of CLD activity directly with transcriptome levels and also to uncover what aspects of the RNA life cycle are impacted by CLD action. Overall, this comprehensive research plan will help elucidate the novel roles cyclophilins play both directly and indirectly in RNA biology."

Classical cadherins consist of five extracellular cadherin (EC) domains connected by linker regions. Upon initial encounter of two cells, cadherins on opposing membrane surfaces bind to one another and initiate a series of events, beginning with the formation of large ordered assemblies, that ultimately lead to cell-cell adhesion. The project involves integrated experimental and computational studies on the structure, dynamical properties and function of classical cadherins. Analysis of existing three-dimensional structures, the design of site directed mutants, binding affinity measurements and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy will be used to elucidate the factors that enable cadherins to bind to one another in a highly specific fashion, despite being similar to one another in sequence and structure. EPR will also be used to study changes in cadherin flexibility resulting from cell-cell contact and the formation of trans (different cell) adhesive bonds. Coarse-grained molecular simulations will be used to understand how these changes in flexibility lead to the formation of cis (same cell) interactions that drive the lateral clustering of cadherins on cell surfaces. The project will lead to a deeper understanding of this important class of molecules and will also reveal general principles regarding the mechanisms employed by other families of adhesion molecules to mediate cell-cell recognition.

Despite enormous efforts invested into characterizing molecular interactions, their complexities make it very difficult to predict and manipulate cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations. This project aims to elucidate the strategies by which cells achieve ""dimensional reduction"", i.e., how cells themselves manage to reduce the multiplicity of molecular information and direct simple coherent behaviors. The specific topic will be on bacteria growth, with focus on how a bacterium cell determines how fast it grows and how it uses this information to coordinate metabolism and gene expression. Student and post-doctoral researchers supported by this grant will learn to make molecular and behavioral characterization, develop mathematical models to relate these measurements, and test specific hypotheses on the mechanism of dimensional reduction. The lessons learned will be integrated into the graduate-level curriculum in Quantitative Biology being developed by the PI, both for students of biological sciences to learn the mathematics of dimensional reduction and for students of physical sciences to learn different types of experiments to characterize molecular interactions and behaviors. <br/><br/>This research program will focus on the ppGpp signaling system underlying growth control of E. coli as a specific molecular system implementing dimensional reduction. From known qualitative features of ppGpp-based control in E. coli, a quantitative model of growth control is proposed based on both positive and negative regulation of protein synthesis via ppGpp signaling.  This research program will test and elucidate the details of this ppGpp-based mode of growth control, probe its dependences on key components of the signaling and control circuit which set its few parameters, and determine its consequences on the kinetics growth transitions by E. coli, from one exponential growth state to another through periods of growth arrest. The final output of this research is a predictive, mechanistic model of bacterial growth dynamics in response to changes in the environment, including nutrient availability and antibiotics.

The synthesis of many of these peptides involves a class of enzymes called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.  These enzymes function in a manner analogous to an assembly line with enzyme workstations or 'modules' that coordinately build the peptide one amino acid at a time.  The goal of this project is to learn the rules for mixing and matching the workstations from different non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.  Ultimately, this would allow researchers to construct hybrid enzymes that synthesize novel peptides and then screen the peptides for therapeutic properties.  This research will provide cross-disciplinary training due to the collaborative effort between faculty in the biological sciences and engineering sciences.  This cross-disciplinary approach will be integrated into a formal undergraduate capstone course, an undergraduate summer research program, and outreach to K-12 students. This approach will also expose the students to basic scientific questions (e.g. substrate recognition) and show the students how this information can be applied to an important goal (e.g. production of designer molecules).<br/><br/>During non-ribosomal peptide assembly, the adenylation (A) domains recognize specific amino acids and tethers them to partner peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains.  Condensation (C) domains subsequently form amide bonds between two neighboring PCP-tethered amino acids in a directional manner, forming the peptide backbone.  Structural and biochemical studies have identified A domain specificity codes that define the amino acid recognized by the domain.  While this code has proved enormously useful in predicting the amino acid activated, a number of studies have shown that altering the residues that define this code nearly always fail to switch substrate specificity.  Furthermore, complete domain or module swaps generating chimeric non-ribosomal peptide synthetases generally fail to function efficiently, likely due to improper protein-protein interactions or substrate specificity of the associated C domains. This project will investigate the reprogramming of both A and C domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases using in vivo directed evolution approaches.  Using these approaches, this study aims to define a means for generating functional chimeric A domains, identify new A domain specificity codes for altering amino acid recognition, and understand the residues governing substrate recognition by C domains.  Results from these studies will aid our ability to rationally reprogram the biosynthesis of this important class of natural products to generate designer molecules for a variety of applied purposes, while also gaining insights into how nature has accomplished this goal."

Proteins are ubiquitous in nature, executing biological functions as diverse as populating the immune system with defense agents against viral infections, digesting food, serving as materials to create skin, muscle and hair, converting signals from the environment into cellular responses and replicating DNA. The RCN:PFC will probe the molecular mechanisms by which proteins adopt their unique shapes and the dynamic processes by which those shapes enable their plethora of functions that maintain life.  These phenomena are sufficiently complex that a consortium of experts in both experimental and computational methods is required to understand their properties. The consortium also aims to provide a novel and interactive training and mentoring platform for younger scientists in the field. To achieve these objectives, the PFC will support two annual meetings, one with the principal investigators and another with the investigators and their students, and a website. In many ways, the consortium acts as a virtual institute focused on a studying one of the most important and fascinating problems in biology. It is anticipated that accelerated progress towards a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles that govern protein folding reactions and protein dynamics will have a major impact on biochemistry, medicine and the biotechnology industry.<br/><br/>The goal of this Protein Folding Consortium (PFC) is to transform the way that scientists think about the protein folding problem and protein dynamics by creating a consortium of experimentalists, theorists and computational biologists whose collective efforts exceed the progress attainable by individual labs.  Advances in high performance computing combined with novel sampling methods and the application of sophisticated experiments now make it possible for simulations and experiments to study protein folding and dynamics on similar time scales.  Simulations generate testable predictions for experiments. Results from experiments can be used to refine simulation methodologies and force fields. This iterative synergistic approach between simulation and experiment, when deployed across proteins of different folds, sizes, complexity and evolutionary profiles, will allow for a coherent and convergent description of the folding process.  The expanding ambitions of the PFC encompass folding in vivo, the evolution of biophysical properties, the coupled folding and binding of intrinsically disordered proteins, macromolecular machines and functional dynamics.

All eukaryotic organisms, from yeast to humans, organize their genomic DNA by repeatedly wrapping it around DNA-associated proteins, called histones, into small spools known as nucleosomes. These nucleosomes, which are about a millionth of a centimeter (10 nanometers) in size, are strung like beads on a string to form long chromatin fibers that ultimately make up chromosomes. The spatial arrangement of these nucleosomes within the chromatin fibers continually changes, often through coordinated movements. However, current technologies are limited in quantifying these structural rearrangements, and this limitation has in turn limited our understanding of how chromatin controls gene expression. This project will monitor structural changes in chromatin as gene expression is switched between the 'on' and 'off' states by developing DNA-based nanometer-sized calipers to detect structural changes in chromatin at the 10 nanometer to 100 nanometer scale, which covers a critical range for events during the regulation of gene expression. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in molecular biology, biochemistry, DNA nanotechnology, and single molecule detection, which will position them to become significant contributors as the next generation of biotechnology scientists. The PIs will also work with outreach programs, including the OSU Minority Engineering Program, the Women in Engineering Program, and the Masters to Ph.D. Bridge Program, to improve diversity and interest in the fields of biotechnology and biophysics.<br/><br/>The conversion of chromatin between open euchromatin and compact heterochromatin is essential for the regulation of transcription and cellular differentiation. This conversion is regulated by histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chromatin architectural proteins that recognize these PTMs to dynamically control chromatin structure. However, the dynamic chromatin structural properties that regulate transcription are currently not well understood. These properties includes changes in the distance between nucleosomes, changes in nucleosome orientation, and the time for these structural changes to occur. To directly investigate chromatin structural dynamics, this project is using DNA origami nanotechnology to develop DNA-based nano-calipers that quantify 10 nm to 100 nm distance changes within large macromolecular complexes. The project will use this DNA nano-caliper design to: (i) determine the long range structural dynamics of heterochromatin that is formed by Heterochromatin Protein 1 as it interacts with the histone H3 PTM, lysine 9 trimethylation, and (ii) determine the long range structural and dynamic response of compacted heterochromatin to the binding of transcription activating complexes. This approach involves integrating PTM-containing chromatin molecules into DNA nano-calipers where each end is attached to opposite nano-caliper arms. The DNA nano-caliper conformational changes will then be detected separately with transmission electron microscopy to determine the distribution of chromatin conformations and single molecule fluorescence to determine the transition rates between distinct chromatin structural states. These studies will provide key distance and time measurements of the structural dynamics that occur during heterochromatin formation and heterochromatin decompaction as transcription activators bind to their target sites. More broadly, the development of this DNA origami nanotechnology will be widely applicable to the study of numerous biological complexes that undergo structural changes on the 10 nm to 100 nm length scale.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics Programs of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Physical and Mathematical Sciences."

All known living organisms use at least a subset of these cofactors in various aspects of metabolism. While their importance in sustaining basic biochemical reactions is widely recognized, the mechanisms of sulfur activation, trafficking, and insertion into cofactors remain not fully understood. It is widely recognized, however, that the free amino acid cysteine is the source of sulfur for the biosynthesis of most sulfur-containing cofactors in bacteria, eukaryotes, and some species of archaea. A family of enzymes named cysteine desulfurases catalyze the first step in sulfur activation. This project will determine the effect of physiological reducing agents -specifically, thioredoxins and small molecules that contain sulfur (glutathione, bacillithiol, and mycothiol)- in biosynthetic reactions and identify specific protein interactions controlling the reactivity of cysteine desulfurases and their sulfur acceptors.

One of the major challenges is that sulfur-acceptor proteins are often shared across multiple biosynthetic pathways.

How proteins recognize and bind (stick) to the correct partner(s) is one of the ways information is communicated within and between the cells. This is how cells process information and make decisions at the molecular level. Atomic-level information is essential to explain the specific interactions between proteins in terms of structure and dynamics. The research project consists in developing and improving the computer-based approach of ""molecular dynamics"" to calculate and predict accurately how proteins bind to one another. Molecular dynamics (MD) consists of using Newton's classical equation, force = mass x acceleration, to simulate the motions of all the atoms as a function of time. The MD simulation, although an approximation to the real world, provides detailed information about the time course of the atomic motions that cannot be accessed experimentally. The approach based on atomic models and MD simulations is advantageous because it does not rely on any particular assumption about protein binding. Being able to predict the possible binding partners of a protein from computations will open the door to a much better understanding of living cells. In addition to developing methods that will be of broad utility to the scientific community, the project will provide inter-disciplinary training and mentoring to young scientists at the undergraduate and graduate level (including members of under-represented minorities), as well as outreach to high school students. <br/><br/>The research project consists in improving the theoretical and computational methods to calculate and predict accurately how molecules bind to one another. According to the theory of statistical thermodynamics, the quantity that controls the association of molecules is the binding free energy. This mathematically well-defined quantity can be calculated using computer simulations of atomic models of the molecules of interest. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can help elucidate the fundamental principles governing the binding of biological molecules at the atomic level. MD consists of constructing detailed atomic models of the macromolecules and using Newton's classical equation, F=MA, to literally simulate the dynamical motions of all the atoms as a function of time. The microscopic forces (the ""F"" in Newton's equation) are approximated by using a potential function, also called a force field, constructed from simple analytical functions. Validating the accuracy of the force field is also an important use of computations based on MD simulations. The calculated trajectory, though an approximation to the real world, provides detailed information about the time course of the atomic motions, which is impossible to access experimentally. Efforts in this area are likely to have a large impact because biology is entering a quantitative era that requires an ability to predict the binding of molecules. The first specific objective of the research is the design and development of novel computational methodologies addressing the specific challenges presented by protein-protein interactions. Sampling the large number of accessible configurations of the solvated proteins is critical. Simply running longer unbiased MD is not going to lead to success, and special enhanced sampling methods are needed to achieve this. The second objective is to validate and test the computational methodology and assess the accuracy of the atomic force field on the basis of well-known protein-protein complexes. It is important to know if the results are correct for the binding free energy, the entropy and enthalpy decomposition, and the kinetic rate of association. In the last stage, the objectives are focused on testing the computational method with respect to increasingly challenging situations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Understanding this problem requires expertise from a variety of different disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and biology, that are often separate in the scientific culture. This research fosters cross-disciplinary training early, at the undergraduate level, by re-engineering how organic chemistry laboratory is taught, and connecting it to this pressing research problem. The results of this study provide critical insight into how cells respond to their environment while preparing the next generation of scientists to break down interdisciplinary barriers in the workplace.<br/><br/>Proteins called transcription factors (TFs) have the critical task of integrating intra- and extracellular signaling pathways to precisely regulate gene expression in response to stimuli. TFs regulate genes by binding specific DNA sequences and nucleating the machinery needed for transcription (RNA synthesis). Recent large-scale efforts have defined the core DNA sequence preferences for hundreds of TFs, but very little is known about how these crucial regulatory signals change TF:DNA binding activity. This project may determine how external signals remodel the intrinsic properties of TF:DNA binding to redirect genomic association and gene regulation. Using the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, a hormone activated TF) as a model system, the effect of ligands and phosphorylation on the specificity and kinetics of DNA binding are measured in vitro, and compared to GR genomic occupancy and DNA binding dynamics in live cells. DNA binding specificity are measured in vitro using high resolution systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX-seq) from which thermodynamic models of binding covering all possible sequences are generated, and in cells using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). DNA binding kinetics are measured in vitro using single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and in cells using single molecule single molecule tracking (SMT). The consequence of changing specificity and kinetics are then tested using cell lines with engineered binding sites generated using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Students in the undergraduate Advanced Organic Laboratory course at Butler University synthesize some of the ligands to be used in the research, and also participate in their testing.  The results build on current static descriptions for understanding specificity and regulation, by enabling creation of new models that predict the effect of changing intrinsic properties on regulating cellular function.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Emerging Frontiers in the Biological Sciences Directorate, and by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

These methods show promise for developing new strains of bacteria for use as factories for making compounds for therapeutic and industrial purposes. The protein, called red beta, binds to synthetic DNA and recombines it into the bacterial genome to make desired alterations. Remarkably, the protein can modify multiple target sites in the genome simultaneously, using libraries of DNA molecules for each site, while selecting for a desired functional output. Thus, the protein can drive rapid (but controlled) evolution of bacterial genomes in the laboratory. The specific goals of the project are to map out the regions of the protein that contact and manipulate the DNA, to understand how the protein works, and to isolate variants of the protein that work more efficiently. The desired outcome is to develop new proteins that can be used to improve and expand the current methods for bacterial genome engineering.

This EAGER project aims to address this question by examining the function of a conserved archaeal nucleic acid remodeling protein in both transcription and DNA repair. These studies are expected to provide new insight into the interplay between DNA-break repair and transcriptional mechanisms, which will be relevant across all domains of life. The research directly incorporates student participation at multiple education levels and provides a strong laboratory education for graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school sophomores and juniors. These students are integral contributors to the project and will be trained in biochemical, molecular, and cellular methodologies that will prepare them for careers in the sciences.<br/><br/>To maintain genome integrity, cells must cope with multiple DNA structures that arise during replication, transcription, and repair. Transcriptionally active regions of the genome are particularly susceptible to DNA damage because specific nucleic acid structures produced during this process have the potential to become double-strand breaks. This project will address the fundamental question of how cells contend with DNA double-strand break damage at critical areas of active transcription. Archaea are prokaryotic organisms distinct from eukaryotes and bacteria that share attributes with both, making them particularly valuable models for understanding the evolutionary persistence of not only individual proteins but also major cellular mechanisms. In this EAGER project, the role of an archaeal Swi2/Snf2 motor protein in mediating DNA repair in transcriptionally active regions will be investigated. The research will incorporate both in vitro biochemical and in vivo cellular approaches to establish Swi2/Snf2 protein substrate preferences, determine the effect of the protein on R-loops, and evaluate its involvement in mediating DNA break-repair at a defined transcriptionally active site. This project is expected to provide a framework for integrated studies of the highly conserved Swi2/Snf2 family proteins functioning as nucleotide remodelers at the interface of DNA break-repair and transcription."

In order for RNAS to perform their specific functions in cells they often need to be processed by protein factors.  Protein processing is generally associated with structural changes that are very important to the processing protein function.  This research project will develop chemical-based methodologies to identify and characterize the protein structural elements that can regulate the activity and initial structural state of essential RNA processing proteins. The second objective of this research is to provide an effective training environment for students interested in RNA-protein research.  Undergraduate students will perform all investigations, including the synthesis and purification of all RNAs and proteins utilized in this study. To cultivate a rich learning environment, comprehensive multi-approach mentoring and Just-in-Time teaching of experimental research will be used. This mentoring infrastructure is designed to advance problem solving and critical thinking skills in experimental design and analysis, and it has been successful in the past. Thus, this project will not only further the understanding of protein regulation, but also provide a strong foundation for students in the sciences. <br/><br/>DEAD-box proteins constitute a large sub-class of putative unwindases essential in many RNA metabolic pathways. For example, Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and assembly are highly regulated pathways requiring several DEAD-box proteins. This family of proteins couples cellular function to protein structural changes. In a subset of DEAD-box proteins, activity is mediated through additional peripheral elements/domains. The goal of this research is to understand the structural and thermodynamic nature of peripheral domain effects on the activity and conformational state of a model protein. Specifically, a DEAD-box protein model will be biochemically characterized and comparatively analyzed to evaluate the catalytic consequence of domain deletion variants. Equilibrium and kinetic methodologies will be developed to study the effects of initial conformations on nucleotide binding. Lastly, solvent-accessible and dynamic regions will be identified for the model system. Since the deregulation of the model protein and its human homolog has critical cellular consequences, the proposed research will further the understanding of (1) how DEAD-box proteins can bind early during processing and function in later events, and (2) how DEAD-box proteins and other RNA folding and processing accessory factors can utilize various conformations to regulate activity. Thus, the characterization of these states is important for any protein that utilizes ATP hydrolysis within a dynamic multi-factor complex."

However, these organisms exhibit more limited physiological responses to light and nutrients than many more complex cyanobacteria, which are often considered to be more difficult to study. The concept behind this project is ""to let nature be the guide"" to study photosynthesis in stressful settings in situ and to understand those photosynthetic processes identified mechanistically by using laboratory model organisms, genetics, biochemistry and biophysics. By learning more about adaptation and acclimation in cyanobacteria, it should be possible to develop strategies to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crop plants. The recently discovered capacity of some cyanobacteria to use far-red light for oxygenic photosynthesis raises questions about how those cyanobacteria are able to expand their usage of the solar spectrum reaching Earth's surface. This project will use genetic systems that have been developed for non-model cyanobacteria that exhibit diverse adaptive and acclimation responses. Genetic methods, together with physiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used to study the photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms. This proposal offers a unique opportunity to expand knowledge of 'real-world' photosynthesis and is likely to provide new insights for engineering photosynthetic organisms intelligently for human needs, including expanding the light-use capabilities of crop plants. This project will provide training for underrepresented minorities in STEM research and education. The developed photobioreactor concept for the classroom will be used to involve K-12 level students in STEM education.   <br/><br/><br/>The defining premise of this project is that terrestrial cyanobacteria have evolved novel adaptive and acclimation responses to optimize light harvesting and energy trapping in environments with strongly filtered (e.g., far-red) light, variable redox states, and the intensive energetic demands of nitrogen fixation. Many cyanobacteria have a cluster of 17 genes encoding core subunits of Photosystem I (PSI), PSII, and phycobilisomes. Combined with the synthesis of chlorophylls (Chls) f and d, the products of these genes confer an acclimation response that permits growth in far-red light (700 to 800 nm), a process known as FaRLiP. This project will use the genetic system developed in Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 to dissect FaRLiP and other postulated acclimation and adaptive responses by determining role of different genes and their variants in acclimation responses of PSI and their roles under anoxic, nitrogen-fixing conditions. This project will also characterize the energy transfer and trapping kinetics in PSI and PSII complexes and study long-wavelength-absorbing phycobiliproteins from cells undergoing FaRLiP and other adaptation/acclimation responses by performing genetic analyses and manipulations, biochemical analyses, mass spectrometry/proteomics, site-specific mutagenesis, biophysical methods (EPR spectroscopy, time-resolved optical spectroscopy).

The members of the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) protein family function in chromatin structure in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Specifically, this project will examine the role of HP1 proteins in gene regulation and the molecular mechanisms mediating this role. It is essential for an organism's survival and health to ""turn on"" the correct genes at the correct time and place. The results from this study will improve scientific understanding of why this process sometimes goes wrong and how it might be corrected. In addition to furthering knowledge about chromatin, this study will serve to train minority students in chromatin biology through a summer internship program and support the development of a classroom undergraduate research experience (CURE) specifically targeted to minorities and non-traditional students transferring from community colleges to four-year institutions. <br/><br/>This project will use transcriptome analysis of Drosophila lines lacking HP1 proteins and chromatin state information from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to evaluate the impact of HP1 proteins on gene expression. This analysis will reveal the contexts in which HP1 proteins function as transcriptional activators or repressors, and how cooperative effects differ from individual effect. Analysis of the impact of HP1 recruitment on nucleosome positioning, chromatin composition, and RNA polymerase dynamics will determine how HP1 proteins impact gene regulation. These experiments will identify the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the effects of HP1 proteins on gene expression. Finally, biochemical analysis of the transcription-start-site-(TSS)-associated HP1 complexes will determine why single HP1 complexes are formed at some TSSs, while others recruit multi-HP1 complexes. The findings will provide the foundation for understanding how this important class of proteins is recruited to their target sites and carries out diverse functions in chromatin structure and gene regulation.

These structures are critical for translation of the uncapped viral RNAs into proteins. 3'TSS is an example of the long-known, better-studied tRNA-like structures found in viral RNAs, but the existence of the kl-TSS was unsuspected and came to light during previous research. The newly found, internal kl-TSS, with its three-way branched secondary structure, binds to 40S, 60S and 80S ribosomes and can simultaneously engage in a long-distance interaction with 5H2, a coding region hairpin located near the 5'Untranslated Region (UTR). The 3'TSS is also likely to connect with 5H2, and the whole system will be exploited to learn how different tRNA-mimics interact with ribosomes to enhance translation. Specifically, a novel ""pick-up and delivery"" hypothesis will be evaluated, i.e., the idea that multiple TSS may be connected via RNA:RNA interactions with the ends of virus-encoded Open Reading Frames (ORF), to gather ribosomal subunits downstream of an ORF at the end of translation and relay them back to the 5'UTR for another round of translation. In addition, it will be tested whether the kl-TSS can enhance translation of capped mRNAs produced from expression constructs. These experiments will inform our understanding of how this novel and possibly widespread use of tRNA mimicry operates to enhance translation and to control plant virus life cycles. The project will also lead to the development of expression cassettes with enhanced translation of encoded proteins with potentially extensive agricultural as well as laboratory applications."

These different cell types develop in precise spatial patterns that form the body plan of the embryo. Decades of genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that cells communicate using secreted signaling molecules, and that the signaling pathways activated inside the cell by these molecules are essential for conveying positional information to each cell, so that it specializes correctly. While many of the components of these pathways have been discovered, how the processes of signal interpretation and specialization occur has remained obscure due to the difficulty of observing and perturbing embryonic development. This challenge is particularly acute for mammalian embryos that develop in utero. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a potential solution to these challenges, as they are capable of following developmental programs in a culture dish, enabling elucidation of human development to a degree that is otherwise impossible.  This project combines experimental studies of hESCs grown in particular spatial patterns and mathematical modeling to dissect how cells interpret signals and differentiate in spatial patterns during the earliest stages of development. Coupled with this research program is a spectrum of educational activities aimed at training the next generation of scientists to perform interdisciplinary, quantitative research in the biological sciences. Planned activities include outreach to K-12 students, education aimed at high school advanced placement teachers, and innovative undergraduate and graduate courses. Following successful introduction at Rice University, these courses will be widely distributed through the Coursera online platform.<br/><br/>Mechanistic studies of pattern formation during mammalian development are challenging due the difficulty of observing and manipulating the embryo in utero. This project takes advantage of a recently developed in vitro system in which patterns form in hESC colonies grown in controlled geometries using micropatterning technology. The patterns form from the combination of an inductive signal added to the culture medium (BMP4) as well as paracrine signals between cells that have been identified as Wnt and Activin-Nodal signals. The project will use this system to quantitatively deconstruct the mechanisms of early patterning in the mammalian embryo. First, similar micropatterning technology will be used to isolate extremely small colonies of hESCs (1-10 cells). Colonies with a single cell will be used to directly measure the response to the inductive signal without interference from neighboring cells. Colonies with two cells will be used to understand the response to the paracrine signals in a simplified system, while those with larger number of cells will be used to measure how cells integrate signals from multiple neighbors. Results from these small colonies will be used to create mathematical models capable of predicting patterning in larger colonies of thousands of cells that display the full spectrum of embryonic fates. These models will be validated and further developed by experiments using live-cell imaging reporters for the activity of the BMP, Wnt, and Nodal signaling pathways together with reporters for cell fates. These dynamic observations are only possible in the in vitro development system, and will be used to correlate the dynamics of signaling in each individual cell with the fate it ultimately adopts. Taken together, these results will provide unprecedented understanding of early mammalian development and reveal principles of paracrine signaling and in vitro tissue self-organization."

Scale invariance refers to maintenance of constant relative size of an organ with respect to the whole body during animal development or between individuals.  A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain scale invariance in biological pattern formation. Regardless of their specific molecular interactions, however, the vast majority of these mechanisms require morphogen gradients as the spatial cue, which are either predefined or generated as part of the patterning process. In preliminary work, using Escherichia coli programmed by a synthetic gene circuit, the investigator has demonstrated the generation of perfect scale invariance of ring size versus colony size in robust, self-organized ring patterns of gene expression in the absence of an apparent morphogen gradient. This observation raises a fundamental, unresolved question: How does scale invariance occur in self-organized patterns in the absence of a spatial morphogen gradient?  To address this question, the investigator proposes to develop and optimize an experimental platform to examine scaling properties of self-organized pattern formation in engineered bacteria. This platform couples inkjet printing technology and synthetic gene circuitry to explore the role of morphogen as a temporal cue in the pattern formation process, guided by mechanistically based mathematical models.<br/><br/>This award is funded jointly by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in MCB and the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program in CBET."

Scientists have learned much about how these tiny living creatures function, facilitating breakthroughs in medical, energy, and bioremediation sciences.  However, the understanding of how microorganisms grow and thrive in harsh environments remains largely cloaked in mystery.  The ability to predict how microorganisms will respond to environmental changes or the knowledge of the types of reactions that occur inside and outside their cells is vastly under-represented. In a large part, this is due to the limited ability to identify the small molecules produced and consumed by microbes (metabolites).  This unknown microbial metabolite landscape limits the understanding of the microbial processes playing key roles in the regulation of biogeochemical cycles, bioremediation, bioenergy production, as well as the human microbiome. In this work, state of the art techniques will be used to find and characterize metabolites that up until now have been largely invisible to researchers.  The work will result in excellent training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, especially from under-represented groups such as Native Americans, as well as a series of lectures at the Thermal Biology Institute that provide an opportunity for effective outreach and give the public a view of the importance of microbes. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the discovery of unknown microbial metabolites produced by bacteria using the Gram-negative soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 5A as model. This bacterium is a model for understanding how microbes metabolize arsenic, a critical environmental toxin found in contaminated soils and water supplies, and a top priority for bioremediation efforts. Focusing on how microbes metabolize arsenic is important because microorganisms influence arsenic toxicity and bioavailability in every environment thus far studied. Thus, characterization of arsenicals produced by microbes are a focal point of this project that will employ state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomics technology to identify unknown microbial compounds, including arsenicals (i.e. methylated species, arsenolipids, arsenosugars).  Importantly, the analytical approaches developed in this project will be applicable to many facets of biology. The project will greatly enhance researchers' abilities to probe the richness of the metabolomes of microbes, and to gain a much better appreciation for the diversity of microbial unknown small molecules. Focusing on A. tumefaciens as a model system will enable the identification and structural characterization of novel organo-arsenic compounds and arsenolipids. Results from these studies will bring transformative knowledge to the field of microbe-arsenic interactions relevant to scientific research aimed at predicting how arsenic disrupts/alters bacterial metabolism in situ, with broader implications for biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling in nature when microbes must deal with arsenic."

By conducting the work at San Francisco State University, one of the most diverse comprehensive universities in the country, this work will support training in biological and computational sciences of individuals from underrepresented minority groups at early stages in their careers (undergraduate and masters students).  <br/><br/>The project seeks to answer the mystery of the origins of spliceosomal introns in eukaryotes.  The vast majority of introns are DNA fragments inserted within protein-coding genes without a known function and with a quasi-random DNA sequence, raising the twin questions of (i) why are there introns; and (ii) how are introns created in evolution?  To answer these questions, the project uses the strategy of identifying and studying recent cases of intron gain (creation of an intron) and loss (deletion of an intron from the genome).  Recent gains and losses will be identified by direct genome-wide comparison between 50 groups of closely related organisms, as well as by comparison of individual intron sequences within the genomes of a larger set of 1000 organisms.  These identified changes will be scrutinized to determine the molecular mechanisms that gave rise to these changes, the impact of these changes on production of gene products, and the overall impact of these changes on organismal fitness."

Some of these proteins undergo a change in their conformation or shape to carry out these functions. It is challenging to visualize the different shapes of these molecular machines using traditional experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the molecular level understanding of these processes and its implications for protein function remains elusive. This lack of molecular information makes it difficult to develop engineering approaches to regulate protein function. Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a way to observe these movements at the atomic scale. However, significant amount of computer time is required to observe long timescale conformational change processes in proteins. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop efficient algorithms based on machine learning techniques to understand how proteins undergo conformational change and (2) to apply these algorithms to understand the role of protein dynamics in transport of molecules across the cell membrane via membrane transporters. The specific transporters investigated in this project play a critical role in determining crop productivity and neurological disorders in humans. In concert with these research objectives, the PI will develop outreach activities teaching high school girls about computational methods used to investigate protein function via Girl's Adventure in Mathematics, Engineering and Sciences summer camp at the University of Illinois. PI also plans to engage African-American boys at local Urbana-Champaign schools via a three-day after-school program to teach them about protein structure and function.<br/><br/>This project will develop computational methods that can efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein conformational changes. This work is guided by the hypothesis that leveraging ideas from reinforcement learning technique and using evolutionary coupled residue pair distances as order parameters for protein functional dynamics will allow efficient sampling of free energy landscapes. The development of the algorithm called ""Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Sampling"" (REAP) has been initiated. Preliminary results have shown promising application of these ideas to several proteins. The fully developed algorithm would be particularly useful for systems with limited structural information, as order parameters can be identified using evolutionary coupled residues based on sequence information alone. The specific goals of this project include: (1) further develop the REAP methodology to efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein function, (2) test the new methodology to understand molecular processes of high biological importance but with limited availability of structural information. In particular, molecular mechanisms of substrate transport and its regulation for the following transport processes will be investigated: (1) Nitrate transport process via root-associated transporters in plants with applications in increasing the crop yields. (2) Serotonin transport in brain via human Serotonin transporter for elucidating molecular origin of neurological disorders. (3) Sugar transport via SWEET family transporter in Rice with applications in enhancing plant growth. Despite differences in their function and structures, these systems share similarities in terms of their modes of regulation that could allow for a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in membrane transporters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the importance of membrane proteins, understanding of the interactions and functions of the membrane proteome is still greatly hampered by technical challenges; there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to uncover how membrane proteins interact with one another and with their binding partners in the native membrane environment.

The goals of this research are to establish a versatile experimental platform that provides vector maps of protein-protein and protein-membrane assemblies. Key cornerstones of the approach are the use of lipid bilayer nanodiscs (NDs) as a native-like membrane platform and biophysical approaches that rely on strategically positioned lanthanide-binding tags (LBTs). The LBTs are dual-function probes that insert atoms for physical measurements enabling the construction of three-dimensional vector maps of protein assemblies relative to the membrane plane. Measurements will be accomplished via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) to provide distances between lanthanides and center of mass and inter-lanthanide distances. The construction of vector maps will allow accurate measurement of the response of proteins to the presence and absence of binding partners, dynamic protein modifications, and indeed the composition of the membrane itself-thus defining the critical determinants of both assembly and function.

In plant genomes, many cytosine residues are chemically modified by addition of methyl groups. The presence of DNA methylation is often correlated with changes in gene expression, but how such changes influence specific traits is not well understood. This research will develop and implement methods for adding or removing DNA methylation at specific sites in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, thereby paving the way for analyzing the effects of DNA methylation on gene function. Research goals will be achieved in collaboration with high school and graduate students, who will obtain valuable experience in state-of-the-art genome engineering technology.

However, there is currently no systematic method to directly test the causality of these observations. This project aims to develop a set of universal tools for site-specific engineering of DNA methylation states in plant genomes. To modulate DNA methylation states at specific regions of the genome, enzymes that control DNA methylation will be tethered to targets of interest using the CRISPR-dCas9 system.  The approach will first be developed in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as it has a small, unmethylated genome, which will permit easy evaluation of both on- and off-target changes in methylation states. Once optimized for yeast, the methods will be deployed in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to target site-specific methylation and de-methylation. The tools developed through this research will make it possible to test hypotheses relating differential methylation states and phenotypes to enable ""reverse epigenetics"" approaches for predictive studies of gene function and for gene discovery.  <br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate."

The molecular communication between bacteria and host plants that allow the establishment of specific symbiotic or pathogenic plant-bacteria interactions are known in detail. However, commensal plant-microbe associations that dominate in the rhizosphere have not been studied to the same extent and relatively little is known regarding the strategies used by commensal soil bacteria to initiate a loose association with plant root surfaces or the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations. This research aims to characterize key bacterial determinants implicated in the establishment and maintenance of commensal bacteria-plant associations and the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations, in real-time. Experiments will characterize the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the association of Azospirillum brasilense with wheat roots, which is an excellent model to quantitatively analyze beneficial commensal plant-microbe associations at high temporal and spatial resolution scales. Using iterations between experiments and mathematical modeling, the research will characterize the selective advantage that multiple chemotaxis pathways provide to the ability of bacteria to sense and respond to gradients relevant to their lifestyle in the soil and in the rhizosphere. Next, the role of receptors capable of integrating metabolic status with sensing in mediating rhizosphere colonization will be determined. The project will also use a novel expression system to track how changes in the intracellular concentration of a key metabolite (c-di-GMP) affect locomotor behaviors in real time. Last, a quantitative approach to monitor, in real-time, the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the spatiotemporal dynamics of commensal plant-root colonization will be implemented. Most soil bacteria form commensal associations with the roots of plants and the sequenced genomes of these bacteria encode at least two Che pathways. Results obtained will be directly transposable to other motile soil bacteria and will provide much needed quantitative insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of commensal plant-microbe associations. This knowledge is a prerequisite to a systems-level understanding of the diverse plant-microbe associations that exist in the rhizosphere. The approach to real-time and quantitative monitoring of commensal plant-microbe associations will document the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations for the first time and ultimately inform future effective strategies to manipulate the rhizosphere to improve plant health and productivity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will provide new tools and methods to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant-microbe associations, including approaches to track real-time root-microbe associations. The mathematical model derived from this research will be useful in future systems-level simulations of plant-microbe associations for rhizosphere manipulation and promotion of plant health.

Potential binding sites will then be mapped to the Thermus thermophilus HB8 genome using Find Individual Motif Occurrences and functionally validated both in vitro (electrophoretic mobility shift assays) and in vivo (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reactions). Information from this study will provide a better understanding of regulons within a model eubacterial extremophile and will complement ongoing studies, for example, the Structural-Biological Whole Cell Project, which seeks to understand the molecular constituents of life at an atomic level.

Building such circuits from the bottom up, using basic biophysical principles of molecular recognition and chemical dynamics, provides insights into the underlying physiochemical design principles of biological systems, and allows predictive construction of useful circuits with chosen inputs and outputs that go beyond  the ones found in nature. This project will develop a new class of fast biological circuitry that can detect a variety of chosen inputs, such as light and small molecule chemicals, and rapidly (and controllably) respond by generating cell survival and function-determining outputs. The principles being interrogated in this project should enable the design of artificial circuits for a variety of applications including controllable biomanufacturing of pharmaceuticals and biodegradation of pollutants. The project will offer training and research opportunities for several undergraduate students especially from the underrepresented communities via involvement of the local SACNAS chapter at Rutgers University started by the PI. This project will also support teams built by undergraduates to participate in tri-state area biomolecular design competitions.<br/><br/>Several synthetic biological circuits using transcriptional networks in living cells, to enable biological computation with living cells, have been built in the last decade. However, the slow timescales for transcription-based circuit performance (hours to days), heterogeneity and lack of precise control over the levels of biological components, limit the speed, applicability and robustness of transcriptional circuits. The speed of the circuit is especially critical for applications where rapid sensing-and-response is required. This proposal's goal is the development of protease enzyme-based circuits using computationally designed/engineered proteases that can be made responsive to chosen input stimuli such as small molecule chemicals and light, and mutually orthogonal with respect to their substrate selectivity. Well-characterized, mutually orthogonal and diverse class of chemical/light-inducers of dimerization domains (as sensors), designed split-protease enzymes (as actuators), and a redesigned cell survival-regulating enzyme (as output) are being used to construct, characterize and optimize elementary logic gates and circuit elements. This project involves optimization of the emergent properties of circuit elements using chemical dynamics modeling methods that will allow combining multiple input signals in complex ways. Overall, this research develops a combined computational and experimental design strategy to construct stimulus-responsive, protease-based logic gates in cells, and involves optimizing their performance using a mathematical treatment of their emergent behavior in a chemical reaction network modeling framework.

These interactions are mediated by small protein interaction domains (PIDs) that bring together binding partners in a tightly regulated manner. The sequence of these PIDs encodes all the features necessary for their function, including proper folding in a characteristic 3D structure and the ability to recognize their partner specifically yet dynamically. All these features are the result of evolution, and thus are encoded in the evolutionary history of the PIDs. In this project, the PIs will develop well integrated computational and experimental methods that will analyze existing sequences to extract all the co-evolved positions and to evaluate quantitatively their contribution to folding and function. They will use one of the most abundant functional domains that mediate regulatory protein complexes in various signaling networks involved in cells as a model PID. Their methods will enable identification of how coevolved contacts contribute to the folding of these domains. The PIs will then examine the binding interactions of these domains to understand how co-evolved positions contribute to binding. This project closely integrates computational and experimental approaches, offering unique learning opportunities to students involved. This project will provide teaching modules, campus visits, and research internships for high school students.<br/><br/>Protein interaction domains (PIDs) mediate interactions in signaling networks with unique functional characteristics such as (i) displaying tolerance to random mutations yet evolving for new functions, (ii) being involved in allosteric regulations, (iii) interacting with more than one partner yet showing specificity in their interaction. All these features are encoded in their evolutionary history. Recent advancements in sequencing and in evolutionary inference methods enable us to identify co-evolved positions and also conservation profiles. In this project, novel computational methods will be integrated with experimental mutagenesis analysis to evaluate quantitatively the contribution of co-evolved positions to folding and function. Two objectives will be pursued. First, a small set of co-evolved contacts that dictates the depth and smoothness of the folding landscape, ensuring a minimally frustrated folding landscape will be determined. This will elucidate folding principles of PIDs. Second, by integrating the residue dynamic coupling method with the co-evolutionary analysis, the mechanism of co-evolved contacts that govern binding recognition and allosteric regulations in PIDs will be determined. With this information, the project will elucidate the how and why a set of co-evolved positions are critical for fold and function, and provide the blueprints of PIDs. The WW domain will be used as a model PID. WW domains are independently folded, small PID modules that recapitulate all the unique characteristics of PIDs. Moreover, they are one of the most abundant functional modules in cell, mediating regulatory protein complexes in various signaling networks involved in physiological and disease states. The long term goal of this proposal is to devise means for predicting factors that dictate folding and binding recognition of PIDs, which underpin all cellular functions.

This neuronal 'wiring' can change and adapt over time. Many aspects of the mechanisms controlling the changes in neuronal connections remain enigmatic. Nevertheless, the ability to strengthen and weaken neuron connections is critically important because this rewiring is linked to learning and memory formation. Each synaptic connection hosts a large collection of proteins poised to interpret patterns of neuronal communication. This research project seeks to discover how one team of proteins responds to synaptic activity to signal for synaptic changes. The central hub of the signaling team is Pyk2, a protein kinase. Pyk2 activates by rearranging its structure to form a large signaling assembly with associated signaling factors. The goal of this research is to determine the architecture of the Pyk2 signaling assembly. Understanding the assembly and activation of the Pyk2 signaling team will yield insights into how neuronal rewiring is initiated at the molecular scale. This proposal will train graduate and undergraduate students by using a team-based concept where graduate and undergraduate students will have an advisor/advisee relationship.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to reveal the molecular mechanisms of Pyk2 signaling linking post-synaptic Ca2+ influx to the Src cascades that tune synaptic plasticity. Illuminating the architecture of scaffolded signaling complexes remains a frontier goal in understanding synaptic plasticity. However, multi-protein signaling complexes are typically large and highly dynamic, challenging targets for structural characterization. While structures have been determined for isolated pieces of the signaling effectors, a critical question remains: how do the pieces assemble into functional signaling complexes? This project employs several strategies to dissect the activational signaling complex of the Pyk2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase. By leveraging hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, protein interactions and conformational changes will be mapped. Single particle electron microscopy will illuminate the overall shape of the activation complex. These approaches are amenable to describing heterogeneous ensembles of accessible conformers and architectures. Structural restraints derived by the complementary biophysical approaches will be integrated to build a model of the higher-order architecture of the signaling complex responsible for activating Pyk2.

A single cell undergoes consecutive cell divisions to generate a fully developed organism. Moreover, within any organism, dying cells are continuously replaced by new cells via cell division. A key process in cell division is the equal partitioning of the replicated DNA into two daughter cells, a process known as mitosis. During mitosis, the DNA condenses into chromosomes, each constituted by two sister chromatids and the cell cytoskeleton reorganizes into a structure known as the mitotic spindle. The microtubules (MTs) of the mitotic spindle interact with the chromosomes by connecting to specialized protein structures, the kinetochores (KTs) that assemble on each sister chromatid. The MTs of the mitotic spindle can produce forces that can move the chromosomes within the cell and eventually separate the sister chromatids and deliver them to opposite poles, ensuring formation of two daughter cells with correct DNA content. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate mitotic chromosome segregation is a key aspect of our understanding of how life is maintained and propagated. This research project explores the mechanisms responsible for generation of forces within the mitotic apparatus that lead to movement of chromatids such that they are accurately separated during mitosis. The findings of this research will be communicated and disseminated broadly. Moreover, the project will offer opportunities for interdisciplinary research training and education. Finally, an outreach activity, designed for teaching children (grades 5-8) about cell division, will be developed and offered as a permanent activity at the SEEDS - Blacksburg Nature Center and to local schools (through the Biological Sciences Outreach Program).<br/><br/>The specific objective of this project is to dissect the interplay between forces and dynamics of the mitotic apparatus and kinetochore (KT) attachment state during specific mitotic stages. The central hypothesis is that not only the forces produced by the mitotic spindle and the dynamics of the mitotic apparatus are important to ensure correct KT attachment and accurate chromosome segregation, but that, in turn, the KT attachment state (e.g., correct vs. incorrect) can influence the dynamics of the mitotic apparatus and the distribution of forces within the mitotic spindle. The overall objective of this project will be achieved by addressing the following aims: 1. Quantitatively dissect the interplay between KT attachment types and kinetochore-fiber length/angle required for promoting and maintaining spindle pole separation. 2. Define the independent roles of MT poleward flux and KT mechanical properties in correction of KT mis-attachments. 3. Identify the mitotic apparatus mechanical properties that control anaphase chromosome dynamics. Quantitative experimental approaches will be combined with mathematical modeling to reach a level of knowledge that goes beyond the pure understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms and allows to make predictions on how such mechanisms respond to perturbations. This project will also have broader impacts, which will be ensured through initiatives in various areas including research dissemination, interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach to K-12 students."

Various molecular processes converge during cell division to ensure that it takes place with a high level of accuracy and fidelity.  For instance, the genetic information contained with the chromosomes is faithfully divided between mother and daughter cells during each round of cell division or mitosis such that mistakes are very rarely made. The machinery that ensures high-fidelity chromosome inheritance from mother to daughter cells includes a highly elaborate assemblage of filamentous structures called microtubules, and large complex structures assembled upon the chromosomes called kinetochores. Proper division of the genetic material requires that each kinetochore make a proper and stable attachment to microtubules prior to the end of mitosis. Interestingly, kinetochores monitor and regulate their own attachment status; however, how the attachment status of each kinetochore is relayed to the machinery that initiates exit from mitosis is unknown. This project aims to determine how a molecular motor protein called dynein affects and facilitates proper division of the genetic material during mitosis. The results from this project will have significant impact on our understanding of cell division, and the various underlying processes that are tightly regulated and highly orchestrated to perform this critical biological function reproducibly and with high fidelity. In addition, this project will impact the scientific literacy of the community through the implementation of an undergraduate course, and also by teaching elementary students about cell division, and the scientific method.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator will examine how cells accurately and reliably segregate their genetic material during cell division. To prevent errors during chromatid separation during mitosis, cells employ a fail-safe mechanism called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which prevents mitotic progression until all chromosomes have established proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments.  In this project, investigators will probe the role of the microtubule motor protein dynein in the transport (SAC) proteins away from kinetochores,  thereby silencing the inhibitory signal, and allowing the initiation of anaphase and progression through mitosis. A combination of in vitro and in-cell approaches will be employed to understand the role for dynein in this process, and to understand how microtubule attachment status is translated into activation of dynein-mediated SAC protein eviction from kinetochores. These studies will be transformative because they will answer key questions regarding the SAC by implementing a newly developed single molecule approach in which kinetochore dynein activity is reconstituted in vitro. By combining this in vitro approach with in-cell high- and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, the following key unanswered questions in cell biology will be addressed: (1) What is the role of dynein in eviction of SAC effectors from attached kinetochores? (2) What is the biological signal that initiates dyneinmediated eviction of SAC effectors from attached kinetochores? This project will lead to a greater understanding of the control of cell division while training diverse students in basic sciences and providing outreach to K-12 students."

One well-known regulatory mechanism is ""post-translational phosphorylation"" - the reversible addition of phosphate groups to specific amino acids within a protein. Phosphorylation can alter protein binding specificity, enzymatic activity, or sub-cellular location, thereby regulating its interaction with other proteins. But just how this comes about is not yet clear. In fact, an atomic level explanation for how site-specific phosphorylation changes a protein's interaction properties remains an open challenge. This project addresses this challenge by investigating the effects of post-translational phosphorylation on protein conformational dynamics. The protein segments subject to phosphorylation are often the same segments involved in intermolecular interactions. Critically, they often have conformational flexibility that defies explanation by standard biochemical analysis. By investigating how these dynamic protein segments convert phosphorylation into functional change, this project will provide insight into a widespread, yet poorly understood aspect of protein phosphorylation. Gaining this insight is a necessary step toward understanding and manipulating protein interaction networks. This project will bring interdisciplinary educational opportunities to students at early stages of college by developing freshmen courses that introduce physical principles based on biophysical phenomena. This project will also train doctoral students and undergraduate research interns, including members of underrepresented groups, to become highly qualified scientists in the area biophysics and computational biology; the cultivation of such expertise is vital to keep the U.S. competitiveness in research and in the global economy.<br/><br/>The project will combine liquid-state multi-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and mutagenesis to map how site-specific phosphorylation impacts protein dynamics and protein-substrate interactions in the mitotic signaling protein, Pin1.

This proposal will determine the extent to which phosphorylation exploits electrostatic networks to achieve long-range site-to-site communication (allostery). This project will also define how phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered regions nevertheless elicit functional changes at remote binding sites.  Because Pin1 interacts with numerous other signaling proteins, results of this project will give broad insight into the mechanisms by which dynamic protein segments convert phosphorylation into functional change.

The fidelity of signaling in the cell is critical to maintaining overall health and is controlled by signaling molecules that are generated by a variety of enzymes. Of interest here is the category of signaling molecules generated via the action of the breakdown of proteins or peptides, known as proteolysis, performed by intramembrane proteases (IPs), which are enzymes found in the water-depleted lipid membrane of the cell. Although proteolysis performed by proteases is well-known, IPs conduct this water-dependent chemistry in the water-depleted cell membrane. The action of IPs is key to cell division, development, and metabolism, but this unique chemical environment renders the system difficult to study and thus key details of the process remain unknown. The cohesive research/educational mission at the Georgia Institute of Technology involves students at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels to comprehend, at the molecular level, the chemistry and structure of a particular IP type. The research will answer how the specific IP performs proteolysis chemistry on its many substrates in the distinctive membrane environment to generate the signaling molecule products, as a model for the larger IP family. To answer these questions, students will use cross-disciplinary, cutting edge, and high-resolution biochemical and biophysical methods tailored to membranes, training them for future STEM careers. In turn, educational modules for K-12 students will be developed, implemented, and disseminated. In the long term, an understanding of the chemistry and structure of IPs will lead to future research to better understand how IP-derived signaling is regulated at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level to elicit specific biological outcome.<br/><br/>The aspartyl IP sub-class (IAP) will be studied, using as a model an IAP ortholog from the archaeon Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1.

Students will then study the structure of activated substrate/IAP complexes using chemical crosslinking, X-ray crystallography, and small angle neutron scattering, results of which will be complemented by molecular dynamics simulations.

Results of these studies will challenge tenets in the field based on lower resolution or indirect methods, enable the identification substrates for IAPs broadly throughout biology, and will lead to future studies to probe the mechanisms by which intramembrane proteases are regulated. New structure-based hypotheses for further study, including the origin of bulk water entry for catalysis, will emerge. The tailored quantitative methods also hold promise for broad adoption across IAP orthologs, experimental conditions, and IP classes where similar knowledge is desirable. Any unprecedented strategies used for structure determination will be applicable to studies of other IAPs, other IP classes, and membrane proteins.

This investigation focuses on a particularly puzzling type of protein aggregation during which protein-rich inclusions form in protein solutions.  These inclusions are a micron or less in size and have been called the ""mesoscopic clusters"". Despite their small volume, the clusters are essential nucleation sites for ordered protein solids such as crystals and sickle cell anemia fibers. The mesoscopic clusters are also at odds with standard notions of thermodynamics, which dictates that such clusters should be either much larger or should not exist at all.  Understanding the molecular origin of the mesoscopic clusters will resolve a major fundamental question of thermodynamics. This research will test the hypothesis that the mesoscopic clusters are caused by formation of long-lived complexes made up of individual protein molecules. A combination of advanced experimental techniques, theoretical modeling, and computer simulations will be employed to test this hypothesis.  Understanding protein aggregation has implications in all facets of biology as well as on biotechnology and health. At the core of the broader impact activities is training of graduate, undergraduate, and, in particular, high school students.  The project is a multidisciplinary study that spans many topics in physics, chemistry, and biology and represents a great platform for further academic endeavors of the involved students.<br/><br/>The microscopic hypothesis underlying the proposed work is that the mesoscopic clusters stem from the formation of transient protein-containing complexes.  The complexes are stabilized at high protein densities.  In contrast with the bulk solution, the complexes are the dominant protein-containing species inside the clusters. In a steady-state cluster, the influx of protein in the form of monomers is exactly balanced by the outflow of protein in the form of complexes.  The nature of the complex depends on whether the protein is monomeric, as is lysozyme, or oligomeric, as is hemoglobin, ordinarily a tetrameric protein.  The investigators in this study hypothesize that for typically monomeric proteins, complex formation is accompanied by partial protein unfolding and, possibly, domain swapping.  In the case of oligomeric proteins, the complexes are oligomers that contain an untypical number of individual monomers.  A core aspect of the hypothesis is that the complexes are opportunistic; they represent untypical ways to transiently bind individual protein molecules together.  The research team will establish the identity and mechanisms of the complexation using a combination of physicochemical and biochemical experimental techniques (dynamic light scattering, Brownian microscopy, mass spectroscopy, amide exchange NMR, sheer flow) and theoretical tools (molecular modeling employing coarse-grained energy functions and the classical density functional theory).  They will test whether the clusters are truly steady-state objects and explore the possibility that cluster formation has a slow, irreversible component.  This part of the proposed study may answer the question whether clusters ripen according to an Ostwald-like scenario, or a different mechanism is involved."

The aim of this project is to understand how these proteins allow bacteria to adjust their metabolism to different environmental conditions. This knowledge will contribute to the field of bacterial ecology.  This knowledge will also contribute to many areas of biotechnology.  For example, engineering bacteria that are capable of specific adaptive responses is important for waste remediation, metabolic engineering, and bacterial production of natural and artificial products.  This project will expose high school students and undergraduate students to research.  Efforts to broaden participation in the sciences are a major component of this project.  <br/><br/><br/>The overall objective of the project is to understand bacterial adaptation at the molecular level. The goal is to understand the mechanism by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to different environments through the operation of its proton and sodium transporters, and through changes in expression patterns of the various branches of its respiratory chain and its sodium/proton antiporters. There are two goals in the project: 1) defining which of these enzymes are expressed as Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to a range of culture conditions and growth phases; 2) defining the roles of the component enzymes by constructing strains in which one or more of these enzymes have been deleted. Sodium/proton antiporter deletion strains will be used as backgrounds for studying the role of the NADH dehydrogenases and their deletions, by disconnecting the sodium and proton gradients. The role of the three NADH dehydrogenases and the antiporters, and how changes in their expression support adaptation, will be defined. The project will contribute to the basic understanding of how bacteria adapt to different environments. This knowledge is essential for almost any application involving bacteria including biological waste remediation and the use of bacteria to synthesize natural and artificial products. It will also contribute to development of new ways to fight bacterial diseases including those caused by antibiotic resistant strains."

The spooling renders the DNA less accessible and thus interferes with the reading of its genetic information. How then does DNA spooling affect gene activity and regulation? This research addresses this question by investigating the structure of isolated single-gene molecules and gene expression at the single cell level. The essential tools for this research are electron and fluorescence microscopy, combined with mathematical modeling, and yeast genetics. Surprisingly, recent studies have provided evidence that active genes randomly toggle between states during which the gene is either ON or OFF, rather than being on all the time. This random toggling causes the number of gene products produced from a single gene to fluctuate over time. These fluctuations can provide insight into how the gene is activated, but the molecular basis of ON/Off toggling is not understood. One possibility is that random spooling and unspooling of DNA--analogous to the continued opening and closing of a door at randomly chosen time points--may underlie the ON/OFF toggling of active genes. Testing of this hypothesis requires analysis of DNA spooling at the level of single gene molecules. To this end, this research will investigate the structure of specific genes within single cells of baker's yeast by isolation of the gene molecules and subsequent analysis by electron microscopy. The molecules will be isolated from cells that bear mutations in critical biochemical components for DNA spooling, including the proteins that make up the core of the DNA spool. These structural investigations will be combined with analysis of gene expression of single cells by fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling to reveal the dynamics and functional significance of DNA spooling for gene expression and regulation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In this project a postdoctoral fellow and one graduate student will be trained.

DNA lesions can block replication, triggering a cascade of events leading to cell death. To prevent this, cells utilize translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases that can copy over the DNA lesions while temporarily leaving them unrepaired. These TLS enzymes are central to cell survival after DNA damage; however, they are also error-prone and often introduce mutations in genomic DNA. The project will employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines structural biology, biochemical methods and in vivo assays to decipher key protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlying mutagenic TLS in a yeast model system. This research will advance our understanding of the structural organization of the multi-protein TLS complexes and also provide new insights into mechanistic questions about TLS: How do mutagenic TLS enzymes gain access to DNA replication forks? How do active multi-polymerase complexes assemble? What molecular events drive TLS DNA polymerase switching? These questions are central to our understanding of events leading to mutagenesis in eukaryotes and the ability of cells to cope with DNA damage and faithfully transfer genetic information from one generation to the next. This project creates a solid platform for integration of research and education at multiple levels, from advanced post-PhD training to K-12 education. The project will provide plentiful material for graduate and undergraduate teaching, including advanced training courses such as the Connecticut NMR Workshop, laboratory projects for graduate students, and mini-projects for the diverse undergraduate students from the Undergraduate Summer Research Internship program. Finally, it will also engage students from the nearby Farmington High School in ""real world"" scientific research under the umbrella of the Cutting Edge Bioresearch Internship program. <br/><br/>In S. cerevisiae, replicative bypass of most DNA lesions requires the coordinated action of TLS polymerases Rev1, pol eta and pol zeta that replace replicative polymerases at replication forks stalled by DNA damage or fill damage-containing single-stranded DNA gaps left after replication. This process is initiated by mono-ubiquitination of the processivity factor PCNA, which plays a key role in the assembly of the multi-polymerase TLS complex at DNA damage sites. The mechanism by which this TLS complex, often called the Rev1/pol zeta mutasome, is assembled on ubiquitinated PCNA is poorly understood. Important questions remain unanswered about how TLS enzymes gain access to sites of DNA damage and how DNA polymerases switch during TLS. The main goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which the TLS mutasome achieves efficient lesion bypass by analyzing its organization at a structural level. Our central hypothesis is that mutasome activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediated by accessory domains and regulatory subunits of the TLS DNA polymerases. We will test this hypothesis by using a structural analysis to precisely map PPIs that influence the assembly of the S. cerevisiae Rev1/pol zeta mutasome, combined with in vivo assays to probe the significance of these PPIs for mutagenic TLS. To date, the structure and PPIs of accessory modules of yeast TLS enzymes remain largely uncharacterized. To gain insights into the structural organization and regulation of the yeast TLS machinery, we will undertake the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine key PPIs that control the Rev1/pol zeta mutasome interactions with the sliding clamp PCNA. In Aim 2, we will determine structures and probe PPIs of the essential accessory modules that mediate assembly of the Rev1/pol zeta complex. In Aim 3, we will explore additional PPIs that stabilize multi-subunit Rev1/pol zeta assembly. The project will provide new insights into how individual components of the TLS mutasome work together to achieve efficient lesion bypass.<br/><br/>The project is funded jointly by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences."

Transposable elements are abundant DNA sequences found in all genomes, and their ability to move or copy themselves to new locations in the genome contributes to changes that can lead to new genetic traits. The focus of this research is the mPing element from rice, which belongs to a transposable element family that is broadly distributed in plants, animals, insects, and fungi.  Understanding how movement of mPing is controlled offers the potential to exploit these elements as tools for identifying genes associated with beneficial traits, such as high grain yield in cereal crops.  This project will have broad educational impacts relevant to workforce development by engaging a large number of undergraduate students through an inquiry-based biochemistry laboratory course that offers hands-on experience in genetics and protein chemistry.  The project will also involve students in the research laboratory, providing them with direct participation in all phases of the discovery process, from experimentation to presentation and publication of their findings.  <br/><br/>This research will use both genetic and biochemical analyses to determine (1) how mPing regulates its own movement within the genome, (2) the factors that determine its insertion site preference, and (3) how mPing is replicated. This research builds on three previous observations, i.e., increased movement in hyperactive mPing mutants, preference for insertion into nearby genes, and the ability to increase in copy number over time. The mechanisms controlling transposition rate will be analyzed by determining the factors that regulate formation of the active transposition complex. This includes in vivo binding assays (yeast one-hybrid and yeast two-hybrid) to identify the nucleotides and amino acid residues responsible for interactions within the DNA-protein complex. The effects of mutations that modify transposition complex formation will be tested using a previously established yeast transposition assay. To determine if transposition timing is linked to cell cycle control, microscopy will be used to follow the dynamics of transposase protein localization during cell division. The mechanism of mPing insertion site selection will be investigated by determining how altering chromatin structure changes the insertion pattern. The role of homologous recombination repair in the replication of mPing will also be addressed by measuring mPing duplication in control and DNA repair mutants. Together, the results will define the critical self-regulatory mechanisms that control movement in this active transposable element and thereby will suggest what specific changes could be made to increase the utility of these elements as tools for genome engineering.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)."

This project will address this gap in understanding by studying how small RNAs function to inhibit protein synthesis at post-initiation steps. The experiments will be carried out in a unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas. In preliminary experiments, a genetic screen for mutants impaired in small RNA-mediated translational repression identified genes involved in TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling and polypeptide prenylation pathways, thus implicating these processes as key steps in small RNA-mediated function.  To follow up on these observations, experiments will be conducted to: (i) characterize the negative interplay between RAPTOR (Regulatory Associated Protein of Target Of Rapamycin) and the TOR kinase with RNAi effector complexes, mostly through proteomic approaches; (ii) characterize a mutant deleted for a homolog of the Vasa Intronic Gene (VIG) product, via the identification of VIG interactors and their effect(s) on ribosome function; and (iii) identify new factors required for sRNA-mediated translation repression, by means of an insertional mutagenesis screen.

Proper regulation of genes is critical in development and basic biological function from the cellular to organismal level.  The eukaryotic genome exists in complex with proteins called histones.  The  histone/DNA  complex  is  called  chromatin  and  is  composed  of repeating  subunits  called  nucleosomes.  Each nucleosome looks like a spool wrapped with string in which the histones form the spool and a segment of genomic DNA is the string. It is the way in which the DNA wraps the histone core (called nucleosome structure) and the organization of the nucleosomes with respect to each other that allows or restricts access to the underlying genome, determining patterns of gene expression.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to study a variety of nucleosome constructs to determine how a specific model transcription factor associates with a nucleosome containing different patterns of PTMs and how this association alters the nucleosome structure and its dynamic behavior at atomic resolution.<br/><br/>This project supports the education and training of undergraduate and pre-and post-doctoral   students   both in the classroom   via courses instructed by the PI, as well as in the laboratory in which they will carry out the project goals. In addition, the research team will partner with the Iowa-based non-profit organization, the Workplace Learning Connection, to establish an internship program in the laboratory for high school students.  Students  in from  Iowa  City  and  surrounding counties  will  gain  45-90  hours  of  laboratory  experience,  working  on  various aspects of  the project for which they will receive high school credit. This program will provide students with a tangible research experience in the basic sciences, and will also allow the PI to establish mentoring relationships with them that are expected to last well beyond their time in the laboratory. The investigator will continue these activities to contribute towards increased participation in STEM areas, which is imperative for the growth and stability of the United States economy as well as our global competitiveness.<br/><br/>Technical: The main objective of the proposed research is to understand the fundamental and biologically important mechanisms by which histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure. The investigator and her students will utilize NMR spectroscopy and other biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate the interaction of a model system, the BPTF PHD-finger-Bromodomain motif with modified nucleosomes. The investigators hope to understand, in detail, how a multi-domain motif recognizes PTMs at the level of the nucleosome, especially how distinct patterns of PTMs across multiple histone tails are specifically read out. In addition, through measurement of NMR relaxation parameters, they will address the important questions of how histone modifications and effector domain binding regulate the conformational dynamics of the nucleosome, likely stabilizing or destabilizing conformational states that may be essential for downstream function. This research will be fully integrated with a plan for education outreach, focused on sparking interest of high school students in STEM fields."

To do that, plants use various hormones to control how they grow under normal and stress conditions, such as drought, nutrient starvation, sunlight changes, and attack by pests and pathogens. These small molecules also influence crop productivity. The intricate systems that link small molecule hormones to developmental changes in plants are just beginning to be understood. One way of controlling responses to plant hormones is to alter the chemical structure of the hormone; this provides a molecular on/off switch. This project focuses on a family of plant proteins that modify plant hormones to turn them on and off and will use newly identified route for altering levels of the major plant hormone auxin. Understanding how plants control their growth and development, especially to improve their ability to survive under stress conditions, is essential for improving crop yields and for meeting the potential of a bio-based economy in the future. This project will also provide an interdisciplinary training environment for scientists at all levels from postdoctoral researchers to high school students that combines experimental approaches from structural biology, biochemistry, and plant biology.<br/><br/>The integration of pre- and post-receptor metabolic and signaling pathways controls hormone responses for plant growth and development. Metabolism and localization of auxin during plant development is critical for establishing active hormone responses and biological effects. As part of the system that regulates plant hormones, GH3 acyl acid amido synthetases control levels of major plant hormones, including jasmonic acid and auxin, and modulate pathways responsible for plant growth and development, seed development, light signaling, drought response, and pathogen resistance. Biochemically, the GH3 proteins catalyze the conjugation of amino acids to acyl acids to regulate levels of active and inactive forms of jasmonates and auxins. Diversification of acyl acid substrate specificity in this enzyme family allows for alteration of metabolites in biosynthetic pathways beyond jasmonate and indole acetic acid, such as the endogenous auxin indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and for the modification of synthetic auxins, which suggests possible uses in herbicide tolerance mechanisms. This project will determine the role of an IBA-specific Gretchen Hagen (GH3) protein in plant seedling growth, investigate the molecular basis of GH3 protein specificity for different auxins and evaluate the modification of phenoxyalkanoic acids by GH3 proteins as an herbicide tolerance mechanism. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences."

Modeling and understanding of gravitational-wave sources is becoming extremely important as scientists are utilizing data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory to detect black holes and other exotic astrophysical objects (such as ""neutron stars"").  On one level, astronomers require large computers to develop programs that can help us understand the large amounts of data from gravitational-wave detectors, and pick out the real, astronomical sources from a wide variety of noise sources.  But in addition, as detections of gravitational-wave sources occur more frequently, astronomers need to understand what those detections can tell us about the population of exotic objects throughout the universe.  For instance, given the detections of gravitational-wave sources already, researchers ask how many black holes there might be, in our galaxy, and in other galaxies, and how massive are they?  Also, researchers ask: how do those black holes form, and how do systems of pairs of black holes form?  These are important questions in understanding objects at the extreme of the known laws of physics, and to answer these questions, astronomers need to understand not only the lives of individual stars and the formation of black holes and neutron stars, but they need to simulate populations of millions of stars, and the wide variety of events and processes that can affect the development of those stars.  For that work, astrophysicists require large collections of very efficient computers, such as the computer cluster that will be purchased with these funds, to run massive simulations that help us explore these questions.  In addition to the pure research that will be done with this cluster, the PI's group is also well known for generating award-winning visualizations of their simulations, which will be used at a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and public-outreach events.  The entire team also has extensive experience in attracting a diverse group of researchers to STEM research and fields; this cluster will help that group to train a new generation of diverse researchers in data-science methods and scientific computing, contributing to the technical workforce of the nation.<br/> <br/>  This grant will allow the acquisition of a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster that will enable research in the emerging area of gravitational physics. The cluster will be essential to the development and optimization of codes needed for both gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis as part of the Laser-Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration, and GW source modeling for the physical interpretation of the detections. The equipment consists of a large computer cluster (56 nodes) with InfiniBand networking and 70 TB of usable storage.  This cluster will incorporate three innovative Graphics-Programming-Unit nodes (using GPUs appropriate for scientific computing) which will be used as accelerators for special-purpose massively parallel computations.  The cluster will be housed at a top-of-the-line HPC data center on the Northwestern University campus and will be operated and managed by an experienced team of HPC professionals led by one of the co-PIs.  In more detail, the cluster will be used for GW research focused on binaries with two compact objects (neutron stars and/or black holes) in interdisciplinary collaborations between GW data analysts (members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration), astrophysicists, and computer scientists. The goals are to optimize data searches for GW signals (through effective detector characterization), to extract as promptly as possible and accurately the physical properties of the signal sources (through continuous improvements of our parameter-estimation algorithms), and to advance the astrophysical interpretation of the discoveries so we can better understand the sources' origin and constrain theoretical models using our GW observations (through the development of state-of-the-art formation models in different environments and comparing predictions to data). The team is led by PI Kalogera and co-PI Rasio, who are well recognized for their significant impact in these research areas and for their innovative development of new computational tools for GW data analysis and astrophysical modeling of GW sources."

Since then, three other detections from merging black holes have been made. And, on October 16, 2017 a very special event was announced, the first detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars! The event was special because the gravitational waves did not arrive alone. They were accompanied by electromagnetic radiation.  Gravitational wave observations afford an unprecedented opportunity to probe some of the most energetic engines of the Universe, engines with objects where gravity has the strongest grip: black holes and neutron stars. Mining this information requires state of the art computational modeling, data science and theory. The work of this award will be a vehicle for training and educating scientists at Georgia Tech in an exciting and growing field of astrophysics. Graduate students and postdocs will gain experience in high performance computing and data analysis connected to multi-messenger astrophysics. The experience will further the careers of young researchers participating in the effort, acquiring valuable skills that are in demand in a broad range of professions. The detections of gravitational waves have generated an excitement that is palpable. The number of undergraduate students interested in engaging in gravitational wave astrophysics research is becoming too large to handle with traditional setups. This  grant paves the way for undergraduate students at Georgia Tech to participate in projects in this exciting field.<br/><br/>The science in this project involves computational modeling to enhance the understanding of the late inspiral and merger of compact object binaries as sources of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. The focus will be on the role that these binaries play as sources of gravitational and, when neutron stars are involved, electromagnetic radiation.  The projects address astrophysics and gravitational wave physics in the strong non-linear regime, where an accurate characterization of dynamical gravity is required. The numerical relativity work is designed to inform future more sensitive gravitational wave observations about the details of the path followed by compact object binaries into their final state. The research is organized into two areas. The first will focus  on simulations involving intermediate mass black holes. The effort will also involve simulations of neutron star -- neutron star and neutron star -- black hole mergers.  Second, dynamical horizons and numerical relativity will be used to investigate the issue of the final state, namely the approach to the final black hole. The focus will be on the phase when the common dynamical horizon first form in binary black hole mergers. The no-hair theorem will be tested using the multipoles of the dynamical horizon. This award is co-funded by the Gravitational Physics program from the Physics Division and the Astronomy and Astrophysics Grants program from the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was further confirmation of this success. However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory. This research focuses on probing the nature of the Universe at the smallest scales and its basic symmetries with the goal of understanding the stability of mass, the quantum nature of dark matter, and the relation of gravity to subatomic forces and extra spatial dimensions. This program is centered on the CMS experiment currently running at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson at the LHC could give insight into the nature of mass and the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC might unveil lighter mass candidates for Supersymmetry, a theory that naturally explains electroweak symmetry breaking. The precise measurement of 'missing energy' could unveil signatures of many undiscovered particles, some of which could be candidates for Dark Matter. Missing energy could also account for the graviton escaping in extra-dimensions or for other exotic particles.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this research is to exploit the capabilities of the newly installed CMS pixel detector to pursue searches for Supersymmetry. This new detector has an extra barrel and endcap layers, a reduced material profile, a new readout chip to minimize data losses due to high pile-up of LHC events, and an optimized detector layout for 4-pixel-hit coverage over the full CMS pseudorapidity range. These improvements translate to higher tracking efficiencies, lower fake-track rates, lower dead-time/data-loss, an extended lifetime of the detector, all leading to better muon identification, b-quark tagging, photon/electron identification, tau reconstruction, improved ""particle flow"" analysis, and missing energy reconstruction. An improved signal selection efficiency due to improved b-tagging and better missing energy estimation is central to this analysis program to discover Supersymmetry. This effort will also include activities in design and development of additional pixel detector upgrades while maintaining support of Pixel Detector Operations. This challenge of building, commissioning, and maintaining a state-of-the-art silicon detector provides workforce development opportunities in physics and engineering. The data analyses techniques and related algorithms, hardware instrumentation, grid computing, and big data science opportunities carried out in this award give students valuable experience and knowledge enabling them to pursue successful careers in academia or the private sector. The Quarknet outreach activities further foster collaboration with high school teachers, strengthening teaching and learning around the schools in Puerto Rico and motivating students to pursue STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports investigations at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst into one possible origin of this imbalance through the study of whether the lightest fundamental particle in Nature, the neutrino, is made of both matter and anti-matter.   If this is the case, a very rare nuclear process known as neutrino-less double beta decay is possible. This decay, in which a nucleus transforms into another by emitting two electrons and nothing else, would unambiguously determine that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the same particle, i.e. that they are Majorana particles.  The work at UMass Amherst focuses on key R&D aspects for the design of the detector for the nEXO experiment, with research carried out in the lab with postdocs and students (graduate and undergraduate), in an academic, research-intensive environment.  The PI and his group are also involved in operating and analyzing the data of the EXO-200 experiment, a smaller scale nEXO predecessor running in New Mexico and holding one of the best sensitivities for neutrino-less double beta decay to date.  The activities supported by this award train human resources of diverse backgrounds and develop technologies that align with strategic sectors for the US, such as data science and artificial intelligence, nuclear medicine and non-proliferation, and national security programs at national laboratories. The UMass Amherst particle astrophysics group has a record of excellence and diversity for undergraduate involvement in research, and the Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions (ACFI) actively contributes to promoting the physics related to this proposal to the broader physics community.<br/><br/><br/>The core of the nEXO detector is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC), a technology that can identify and suppress with high efficiency most background signals mimicking neutrinoless-double beta decays. The detector will measure the position and energy of each ionizing event occurring inside its volume, as well as finer information about the spatial distribution and sharing of event energy between two detection channels, ionization and scintillation light. Combined with a detector design that minimizes the residual radioactivity in its constituents, this information provides a powerful environment for a neutrino-less double beta decay signal to emerge once all other interactions are properly identified. The UMass Amherst group works on the development of key elements of nEXO. The PI coordinates the design of the nEXO TPC. With his group, he studies novel silicon-based detectors (specifically Silicon PhotoMultipliers, SiPMs) sensitive to the xenon scintillation light (178 nm) that combine good light collection efficiency, minimal radioactive contamination, uniformity of response, and are practically available to cover several square meters of surface in nEXO.   An integral part of the program is a continued participation in the EXO-200 experiment, and the analysis of its data. Of particular interest are refined searches for neutrino-less double beta decay of xenon-136 and xenon-134.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physics is foundational to much of the fundamental research activity of US research and development efforts. The Vanderbilt University Summer REU program offers undergraduate physics and astronomy students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in a variety of subfields of physics. The areas include astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The research mentors are all well funded researchers and all have committed to personally directing the students. An extensive research infrastructure, including the facilities of several large interdisciplinary centers, will be available to the students. Physics students will also have the opportunity to visit major facilities at government laboratories, both domestic and international, including FermiLab, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, and CERN. <br/><br/>As part of the program's emphasis on leadership development, the program includes training in ethical conduct of research, and, as part of the program's emphasis on developing the future workforce, includes a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in physics. The REU program will achieve broad impact. In particular, the track record of the program over the past six years shows that a high percentage of the new participants will be underrepresented minority students, and the track record moreover shows that more than half of those participants will be from institutions with limited research opportunities. To achieve sustained impact, the program is designed to build ties between the Vanderbilt mentors, all of whom are supported with appropriate salary, and faculty at the student's home institution. This builds a larger community, provides for continued support for the student, and enhances the ability for continued mentoring and research participation of the student beyond the REU site experience.  Students also have the opportunity to participate in mini and short courses in entrepreneurship, computing, and data science while at Vanderbilt, as well as participating in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Physics and Astronomy Roadshow outreach program.

These waves typically originate from other galaxies through the merging of two black holes or neutron stars. The gravitational waves then travel galactic distances to reach detectors located on Earth, and the recorded gravitational-wave datasets can reveal information about black holes, spacetime, and Einstein's theory of general relativity.  To realize the full scientific potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments, a model of the expected gravitational wave signal must be both highly accurate and very fast to evaluate. This award will support a multi-disciplinary approach to gravitational-wave science, drawing on collaborations with physicists, mathematicians, and data scientists to produce new algorithms and computer programs aimed at maximizing the scientific output of gravitational wave observations. This award, and more generally discoveries made with gravitational waves, will continue to engage the public through outreach efforts. Students funded through this award will be trained with a strong STEM background and will be well prepared for careers that require technical and computational skills. <br/><br/>This award will support the development, implementation, and use of numerical techniques designed to overcome some of the most urgent challenges in gravitational wave data science. Crucially, the interpretation of gravitational wave datasets requires access to a model which is both fast-to-evaluate and faithful to the relevant physics. Using traditional techniques, these two requirements are often at odds with one another. Recently, a set of targeted numerical tools has emerged as a means to ameliorate, or in some cases overcome entirely, these bottlenecks. For large-scale relativistic astrophysics simulations, the key developments have been towards accurate and robust numerical methods and novel parallelization strategies that will afford unprecedented simulation accuracy. A different set of tools has been developed to construct surrogate models that are able to accurately reproduce numerical relativity waveforms at arbitrary parameter values within a fraction of a second. The goal of this project is to build on these recent successes and to (i) continue the development of these numerical methods by extending them to handle more challenging cases, (ii) implement these methods and models within existing public codes so that they are widely available, and (iii) carry out high-impact scientific studies made possible by the rapid, high-fidelity numerical models and simulation codes that have been built.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classic picture of a nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons. The Standard Model of particle physics describes the structure of these protons and neutrons in terms of more fundamental constituents,  matter particles (quarks) and force-carrier particles (gluons) that bind the quarks together. Revealing the quark and gluon structure of protons, neutrons and nuclei is a fundamental challenge bridging nuclear and particle physics with data science and high-performance computing. In particular, new studies of gluon structure require techniques that will be developed and implemented in supercomputer calculations of the Standard Model theory on the largest computers in the world. Building a new particle collider to measure gluon structure is the highest priority in the long-range plan of the nuclear physics community. This project will provide theory benchmarks for  new experimental programs and facilitate new tests of our understanding of the structure of matter and of the emergence of the complexities of nuclear structure in nature. <br/><br/>This project will focus on new aspects of the fundamental structure of nature through Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations of the gluon composition of the nucleon and of the modification of nucleon structure in nuclei. The results will provide essential information for current and future nuclear and particle physics experimental programs, such as the planned electron-ion collider (EIC) designed to measure the gluon structure of nucleons and nuclei with unprecedented precision over the next decade. In particular, the three-dimensional gluon structure of the nucleon will be cleanly measured for the first time at the planned EIC. A main goal of this project is the first calculation of the gluon generalised form factors describing this structure. Another goal is the first determination of exotic glue in nuclei through the gluon transversity structure function. Finally, first calculations of QCD constraints on several muti-body nuclear effects will be undertaken. These are increasingly important theory inputs to the interpretation of the results of next-generation intensity frontier experiments. For example, these calculations will constrain the modification of the strange quark nucleon sigma term in nuclei, which provides an important correction to theory cross-sections for the direct detection of particle dark matter candidates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the discovery of the Higgs mechanism in 2012 was a crowning achievement for the Standard Model, many mysteries remain, including the role of the elusive neutrino. Neutrinos are elementary particles that rarely interact with ordinary matter.  The Standard Model predicts three types of massless neutrinos.  However, experimentally, we know that neutrinos do have very small masses, and yet they permeate the universe.  Because they have mass, they can change from one type to another.  Measuring properties of these changes, and comparing them to theoretical predictions, provides a promising pathway to discover how neutrinos shape our universe. To that end, the neutrino community is embarking on a challenging quest to complete the picture of neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will be a massive, 40,000-ton instrument optimized to detect neutrino interactions about a mile underground at Sanford Lab in South Dakota.  This facility, being built during the next 10 years, will observe interactions of neutrinos produced at Fermilab and traveling 800 miles to DUNE and, due to its large volume, can also detect particles coming from astrophysical sources.  This work seeks to develop ways to look for and identify signals for new physics.<br/><br/>The DUNE experiment offers a unique opportunity for a rich astro-particle and exotic physics search program, including: observations of low-energy astrophysical neutrinos, e.g. from supernova core-collapse, thus lending itself to multi-messenger astrophysics, and searches for other rare processes, e.g. proton decay and neutron-antineutron oscillation. If observed, these signatures would have profound implications for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The rarity of these signals requires continuous, high-resolution readout and processing of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) data from the entire DUNE detector. The resulting data rates for such a data acquisition (DAQ) scheme are prohibitively large and create a challenge: to develop readout and DAQ systems that are capable of significant data reduction and efficient self-triggering with zero deadtime. This award will carry out a unique and ambitious R&D program to develop novel readout and triggering techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed on FPGA devices, including a demonstration of some of these techniques at the upcoming SBND experiment, beginning in 2019.<br/><br/>This CAREER award will strengthen the undergraduate research experience of Columbia University students, including underrepresented groups. The project will also provide unique opportunities of involvement in cutting edge research in readout electronics, detector R&D, and computer science applications for data handling and data analysis, and further promote interdisciplinary research opportunities for physics and non-physics majors through a Seminar Series developed and organized by the PI.  The award will sponsor an additional slot in Nevis Lab's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program for two years, specifically for non-physics majors interested in particle physics. Outreach to the public and local high-school students will also be carried out through lectures at local high schools and the Nevis Science-on-Hudson public lecture series. Recruited summer high-school students will develop a virtual reality visualization of a supernova burst, as ""seen"" in a Liquid Argon TPC. This visualization will be demonstrated annually at the World Science Festival.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research program of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group (GECo) aims to maximize the science reach of upcoming gravitational wave discoveries and expand multimessenger science with gravitational waves. In particular, GECo will work on studying the cross correlation between LIGO GWs and neutrino detections from the IceCube observatory in the South Pole. Improved detectors are critical for seeing more of the cosmos with higher fidelity while astrophysically informed data analysis enable insight beyond the state of the art of Today. The aLIGO detectors were built to provide insight on elusive cosmic objects from black-holes to neutron-stars.  Therefore GECo's program aims to improve the odds of discovering neutron-star containing binary systems and enhance the value of each discovery via enhanced detector and data analysis performance. In particular, GECo will work on the characterization of the LIGO detector as well as improving and maintaining the timing systems and developing new data analysis algorithms.<br/><br/>Direct detections of gravitational waves provide an unprecedented opportunity born of new data to expose cosmic puzzles using multiple astrophysical messengers. At the root of new discoveries, there will be a multifaceted interplay between improved instruments, advanced understanding of the data, and innovative data analysis approaches relying on a comprehensive mesh of cosmic messengers. GECo will focus on the astrophysical, observational and experimental foundations of synergetic multimessenger campaigns, the firm base of new discoveries. GECo will utilize astrophysical as well as data structure priors to enhance the fidelity of the detections and to enable the confident detection of cosmic signals yet undetected. GECo aims to investigate multimessenger information, with special attention to neutrino counterparts and to enhance electromagnetic follow-up capabilities with low-latency coincident neutrino information. Multimessenger approaches have the potential to enhance the number of detectable sources as more distant, and abundant, cosmic events can become accessible. GECo also aims to investigate gravitational wave searches incorporating astrophysical priors on the properties of binary systems that can potentially enhance search sensitivity. GECo aims to contribute to the proper operation of advanced LIGO, to characterize the performance of mission critical detector subsystems, and to prepare in-depth reports to support exceptional gravitational wave candidates."

LIGO forms part of a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories poised to probe black holes, neutron stars, supernovae and the early universe using gravitational waves as a new astronomical tool. The construction of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) was completed in early 2015 with the first observing run (O1) from 12 September 2015 to 19 January 2016. With the first observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger by LIGO on 14 September 2015, we entered the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. The scientific goals of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis middleware, software sustainability, and computational hardware support. Cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves.

The primary goals of this project are: to allow the LSC to complete the analysis of early aLIGO observations, to deliver the software infrastructure and services to support gravitational-wave astronomy with aLIGO and its international partners, to provide the cyber-infrastructure needed to bring gravitational-wave astronomy together with the broader astronomical community, and to prototype tools for open access to LIGO data for the scientific community and the public. This research program will train students and postdocs to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, push the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed, locally-available computational data grid, and sustain the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission. Proposed collaborations with external partners (including Internet2, Globus, Condor and Pegasus) will have significant impact outside the LSC."

These are the capabilities that make the larynx of an echolocating bat one of the most extreme acoustic ""instruments"" in nature. This project will develop and employ a suite of scientific tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of the extreme physics that underlies the generation of ultrasound in the bat larynx. In addition to extending our understanding of a mammal that perceives the world in a way that is fundamentally distinct from most other mammals, particularly humans, the current research will explore a rich, coupled multiphysics problem that lies at the very edge of current scientific capabilities. Beyond the scientific advancement of elucidating the physics of ultrasound generation in bats, the broader impacts of the project span the fields of computational physics, bioinspired ultrasonic technologies, assistive technologies, vocal dysfunction, animal behavior and cyber-enabled science. The coupled aerodynamics, tissue mechanics and bioacoustics computational models developed here have a wide variety of applications in biophysics and engineering.

In addition, sophisticated experimental tools, such as nano-indentation, micro-Computed Tomography and scanning electron microscopy for model parameterization, will be employed.   Novel ex-vivo experiments to support the development and testing of these models will also be conducted. The specific objectives of the projects are (1) conduct ex-vivo analysis of vocal fold dynamics and acoustics in a vocalizing excised bat larynx; (2) conduct 3D imaging and biomechanical testing of a bat larynx for model development; (3) develop and validate a coupled aero-tissue-acoustics computational model for simulation and analysis of ultrasonic vocalization in the bat larynx; and finally (4) decode the physics of ultrasound generation using the validated aero-tissue-acoustic model.

The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples. It is possible that evidence for BSM physics could emerge at this higher energy and with the higher event statistics. Search for evidence of such physics is the goal of this project.<br/><br/>The California State University East Bay high energy physics group will use data collected by the ATLAS experiment to probe the mechanism by which fundamental particles acquire mass through electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and to search for evidence of new physics.  The group will search for pairs of Higgs bosons and other exotic particles decaying to pairs of b-quarks and pairs of tau leptons.  Study of such rare events has become more viable as the center-of-mass energy of the LHC is increased to 14 TeV and the luminosity of the accelerator facility is steadily increased.  In parallel, upgrades of the ATLAS detector are underway which will allow for further improvements in data recording.   The Cal State East Bay group will focus on reconstruction of particle tracks and their association with primary collision vertices, important for the identification and measurement of the b-quarks and tau leptons in complex particle interactions.

This first detection has ushered in a new era of scientific discovery: an era in which gravitational-wave observations are of vital importance for understanding the transient universe.  This grant supports the research activities of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee LIGO Scientific Collaboration (UWM LSC) group. The theme is gravitational-wave astronomy with an emphasis on activities on the critical path for the scientific success of LIGO. The project's strongest feature is the synergy: bringing highly-engaged faculty with a proven track record in gravitational physics, astrophysics, data analysis, and education and outreach together with undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in a close collaborative environment to deliver gravitational-wave science and to engage the broader community in the discoveries to come. This project will convey the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium.<br/><br/>The UWM LSC group will deliver critical elements to a low-latency search for transient gravitational waves including those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars and black holes. The group will help develop and operate the data-calibration system, an on-line search for signals from compact binary coalescence, and a rapid parameter estimation pipeline. Rapid identification of signals is an essential element of gravitational-wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational waves will reveal the inner mechanism of gamma-ray bursts, provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, complementing existing observations.  To this end, this award supports work that will continue to produce gravitational-wave discoveries of binary coalescence, provide rapid sky-localization and parameter estimation to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, and exploit gravitational-wave observations to measure various cosmological parameters.  This award supports the integration of gravitational-wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The UWM LSC group excels at educating new researchers. This project will train a new generation of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in gravitational-wave astronomy. A main deliverable is a calibrated data set for LIGO which has immense scientific broader impacts. In addition to being used in gravitational wave searches by hundreds of scientists around the world, calibrated data will be distributed to more than 250,000 Einstein@Home users in searches for gravitational waves. As per LIGO open data policy, the data set will also be made available to the scientific community and the public at large."

Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. When the Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) reaches designed sensitivity as scheduled, the burst of radiation that may become the first detection of gravitational waves is already closer to the Earth than the closest star, Alfa Centauri. The gravitational waves in this first detection, and others following soon after, were very likely produced during the merger of binary systems involving black holes and/or neutron stars. There is realistic optimism that, at the turn of the decade, enough of these and other sources will be observed to state with confidence that proper observational gravitational wave physics has arrived. This will of course depend on having in place exquisite interferometric engineering, clever analysis of extremely noisy data, and state of the art source modeling. Regarding the latter, it is imperative to continue exploiting the tools of numerical relativity to model not only as many gravitational wave source scenarios as possible, but also to improve the physics content captured by the simulations. The science in this project supports directly this enterprise, namely numerical relativity modeling to enhance our understanding of sources of gravitational radiation and of gravitational phenomena driving electromagnetic signatures.  The proposed research will have an impact beyond the confines of gravitational wave physics and numerical relativity.  Achieving success in the multi-messenger, computing, and data-analytics projects in this project necessitates an interdisciplinary environment reaching across astrophysics, computing science and even engineering. The Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia Tech will be capable of providing such an environment since its mission is to foster research and education linking high-energy astrophysics, astro-particle physics, cosmology and gravitational wave physics.<br/><br/>This award supports research focused on the computational modeling of  black holes and neutron stars as sources of gravitational radiation. The proposal considers several projects that involve astrophysics with a common denominator  -- the crucial role played by dynamical gravity and the curvature of space-time. The astrophysical phenomena in these projects arise from a marriage between general relativistic gravitation and complex multi-physics involving fluid flows, electromagnetic fields, radiation transport and realistic equations of state. The effort also aims at enhancing our comprehensive  understanding  of astrophysical phenomena beyond what gravitational waves alone will be able to tell,  in other words, electromagnetic and gravitational wave phenomena leading to multi-messenger observations.  The research is organized into two areas: 1) Compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data; and 2) Tidal stellar disruptions by massive black holes. The proposed work will give postdocs and students the opportunity to interact with researchers in computing science and engineering, to develop and implement numerical algorithms for magneto-hydrodynamics, work with large data sets and to participate in a variety of outreach activities. The experience gained in high performance computing, optimization, data analytics, and software engineering will further the careers of young researchers participating in the effort, acquiring valuable skills that are in demand in a broad range of professions."

Grid computing can be viewed as a service for sharing computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet, simply and transparently, without having to consider where the computational facilities are located.<br/><br/>Experiments at major centralized experimental facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) require large amounts of computation and storage and involve hundreds of experimenters using computational facilities all over the world. These features are well suited to the capabilities of grid computing. Grid computing developments occurred in parallel to the development of the LHC experiments. The Open Science Grid (OSG) is the major facilitator of Grid Computing in the U.S. Researchers subsequently developed these ideas in many other exciting ways, producing for example, in addition to OSG,  large-scale federated systems (TeraGrid, EGEE, Earth System Grid) that provide not just computing power, but also data and software on demand. Standards organizations then developed relevant standards that led to possible interoperability of Grids. Grids define and provide a set of standard protocols, middleware, toolkits, and services built on top of these protocols. Interoperability and security are the primary concerns for the Grid infrastructure as resources may come from different administrative domains, which have both global and local usage policies, different hardware and software configurations and platforms, and vary in availability and capacity.<br/><br/>The Open Science Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure for large-scale scientific research. The OSG contributes to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid as the shared distributed computing facility used by the US ATLAS and US CMS experiments. The OSG is built and operated by a consortium of 90 U.S. universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers. It is supported by the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy Office of Science. The OSG supports not only physics experiments but also researchers from other fields, including astrophysics, bioinformatics and computer science. Currently the OSG has more than 60 sites in the US and five sites in Brazil, Taiwan and Mexico, supported by the host countries.<br/> <br/>All LHC computing and storage sites in the US are members of the OSG and allow other scientific collaborations using the OSG to opportunistically use available resources. The OSG collaborates with the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project in Europe to provide interoperating federated infrastructures which can be used transparently by the LHC experiments' software. The Large Hadron Collider, located 330 feet below the border of Switzerland and France, is the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Its very-high-energy particle collisions may yield extraordinary discoveries about the nature of the physical universe. Beyond revealing a new world of unknown particles, the LHC experiments could explain why those particles exist and behave as they do. The LHC experiments could uncover the origins of mass, shed light on dark matter, expose hidden symmetries of the universe, and possibly find extra dimensions of space. <br/><br/>The LHC accelerates hair-thin beams of particles to a whisker below the speed of light. Thousands of powerful superconducting magnets steer the beams around the LHC's 16.5-mile-long ring. At four points the particles collide in the hearts of the main experiments, known by their acronyms: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. In the data from these high-energy collisions scientists search for the tracks of particles whose existence could transform our understanding of the universe. More than 10,000 scientists, engineers and students from almost 60 nations on six continents contribute to the LHC, which is headquartered at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. About 1,700 come from universities and laboratories in the United States. Federal funding for US contributions to the LHC is provided by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation."

Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before.  Along with these tremendous advances in instrumentation, it has been known from the very inception of the gravitational wave physics effort that the envelope of statistical data analysis techniques must also be pushed further to enable the detection of weak and rare signals embedded in noise. It is in this area that the research funded by this grant will make significant contributions. By supporting graduate students, this grant will help to grow the community of researchers in this field. Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in STEM areas to forefront science. Ongoing major education and outreach activities at UTB will leverage these activities to create awareness among high-school students about exciting projects such as LIGO.<br/><br/>This grant supports research projects in the following major data analysis areas. (i) An algorithm will be developed and implemented that allows the construction of sky maps of an anisotropic background of stochastic gravitational waves with minimal prior assumptions. Using methods originally developed in the context of pulsar-timing-based gravitational-wave searches, the new approach will vastly extend the capabilities of existing model-dependent searches. A Bayesian alternative to the standard frequentist stochastic search will also be developed that will leverage existing code for Bayesian inference in the context of detector characterization and noise estimation. (ii) A smoothness-regularization-based coherent network analysis method will be implemented that significantly improves the detection and characterization of burst gravitational wave signals having non-compact time-frequency (TF) signatures. Such signals are expected to arise in a variety of astrophysical scenarios but are known to pose a significant challenge to existing methods. (iii) A new method, derived from the Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) technique developed in acoustical signal processing, will be integrated with existing network analysis pipelines to boost their sensitivity to post-core-bounce-phase supernova signals. By improving both signal waveform and sky location estimation, this will lead to better multi-messenger follow up of such a rare but dramatic event. (iv) The characterization of detector noise and non-gravitational wave signals (""glitches"") in the data is necessary for improving detection confidence for genuine gravitational-wave signals. In this context, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) method will be used for instrumental glitch classification, and glitch characteristics relevant to aLIGO will be catalogued. An independent approach will use the BayesWave Bayesian inference pipeline to identify and study glitch signals."

By learning the relationships between syllables and words, or scientific and mathematical concepts, we produce language, form lexical knowledge, develop physical intuition, exercise logical deduction, and attain expertise in our line of work. Collectively, these relational data can be described as a graph in which nodes might represent syllables or concepts, and edges might represent shared content or conditional probabilities. Yet, how the organization of such a graph impacts our ability to learn the data or the neural processes that affect learning is far from understood. In this project the PI will use network science as a mathematical framework within which she will study the human learning of relational patterns, and answer the question of whether graphs that are complex in the mathematical or naturalistic senses are more or less difficult to learn, or require different neural processes. To facilitate broader impacts, these efforts incorporate art to transform STEM to STEAM, a recent international innovation that improves long-term retention of content and scientific reasoning. The goals of this program are (i) to create a local community - from preschoolers to adults - who are generally inspired by cutting edge science, and who more specifically appreciate the concepts of network architectures in natural information and in their brain?s ability to learn that information, (ii) to produce undergraduate and graduate students trained at the interdisciplinary boundary between network science and neuroscience to address critical and timely scientific questions that transcend national boundaries, (iii) to develop course material that incorporates these timely research questions, and (iv) to polish and release teaching materials developed in these aims to international and global collaborators, and to the public. The PI complements these efforts with extensive mentorship for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, and with educational outreach efforts in under-served inner-city Philadelphia schools.<br/><br/>In particular the PI will use a 3-pronged approach that employs (i) engineering-based tools from network science to systematically define graph ensembles of relational information with dissociable topologies, (ii) behavioral studies to determine which graph topologies are easier or harder to learn, and (iii) functional neuroimaging to identify predictors of individual differences in learning. Exploratory work seeks to translate the knowledge gained in these areas to instructed learning of scientific concepts. In this proposal, the PI brings together her background in theoretical physics and network science, her expertise in multimodal human neuroimaging, her current research program intersecting engineering and cognitive neuroscience, and her recently developed methods to predict individual differences in learning from the dynamics of human brain functional connectivity to determine how the graph topology of relational information maps to individual differences in human learning behavior as produced by dissociable neurophysiological processes."

This is an exciting time for the maturing field of gravitational-wave physics. Construction of Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory), an overhaul of the Initial LIGO interferometers, is now complete and the first couple months of data have been collected. The advanced detectors made last year the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a momentous event that will transform our understanding of the universe and marks the beginning of a new field of gravitational wave astronomy. Predicted by Einstein nearly 100 years ago, gravitational waves are distortions of space-time created by the movements of massive astrophysical objects such as exploding stars and coalescing black holes or neutron stars. The effect of gravitational waves on space-time is minuscule, however, and necessitates the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. This award supports research to improve the Advanced LIGO sensitivity at low frequencies and increase the amount of time the detector is collecting science quality data. In addition, this program will serve as an invaluable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students who will develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines and prepare them to fill positions in academia and industry. The group is strongly committed to sharing the excitement of the field with the public through outreach at all levels, reaching out in particular to the communities in Mississippi.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves can be detected by using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located two-and-a-half miles (4 km) away from one another. The mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all vibrations other than the gravitational wave. The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved a sensitivity to changes in the distance between the mirrors of better than one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. There nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve the interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. One such challenge arises from the design of the commercial seismometers that are used to provide active vibration isolation of the mirrors. The seismometers cannot distinguish between horizontal acceleration of the ground and tilt of the ground. This award supports the development of a high precision tilt-free seismometer to improve the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation. The project includes deriving updated requirements for a tilt-free seismometer based on data from the observatories, designing and modeling the instrument, constructing and measuring the performance of the tilt-free seismometer and conducting a theoretical and experimental noise analysis of the system."

Particle accelerators are the instruments of particle physics and x-ray production. The next generations of particle accelerators are being designed to explore the frontiers of high-energy physics and for xray beams for research in biology, chemistry, physics, material science and medicine.  Accelerator science research is necessary to gain greater understanding of the physical processes that can impact the performance of these accelerators and develop new techniques of particle acceleration technology. The accelerator science research will be conducted at two of the premier laboratories in the United States in accelerator science, the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education (CLASSE) at Cornell University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award will use the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA), to examine important beam physics, such as the electron cloud effect, emittance limitations in storage rings, and the fast ion instability, for future lepton storage rings and x-ray sources. One of the key goals of the CesrTA research program is to improve our understanding of the interaction of the electron cloud with the high-energy particle beam. The electron cloud constrains many of the operational parameters of the storage ring such as beam current; bunch spacing, ring energy, and these parameters can be measured experimentally on CesrTA. Beam dynamics experiments using the CesrTA beam diagnostics capable of quantifying bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics will be used to study important lepton storage ring beam dynamics in the presence of the electron cloud. In addition, we conduct basic accelerator science research on crystal channeling at the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) and the End Station A Test Beam (ESTB) facility at SLAC. Channeling is the phenomenon that arises when charged particles become trapped between the crystal planes due to the electrostatic field of the crystal ions. There is strong interest in using bent crystals as collimators and magnets for high-energy electron and positron beams and well as using crystals as generators of gamma-rays as a positron crystal undulator. The development of a crystal undulator opens the prospect of creation of novel light sources that will find their application in technology, medicine and basic sciences. Both accelerator science research projects provide Cal Poly undergraduate students research opportunities at large accelerator facilities in accelerator science.  Cal Poly students will gain hands-on experience in all facets of the physics research from designing an experiment, simulating the physics, building the hardware, taking the data, analyzing the data, and publishing the results."

Einstein's general relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics.  It is therefore imperative that we subject gravity to the most stringent tests available. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced some of the leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. Since 2006, an experiment called APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has been collecting the best LLR data in the world, in terms of both data volume and precision. In 2016, an upgrade allowed APOLLO to guarantee accuracy at the millimeter level - the first time this capability has existed anywhere.  This project will capitalize on this new capability.  Besides its fundamental impact to all areas of cosmology, this project has a strong footprint in training students and in communicating the excitement of science to the public.<br/><br/>This effort seeks to collect the first-ever set of millimeter-accurate LLR data using APOLLO.  Besides continuing to collect the most accurate LLR data ever obtained, this involves developing techniques to calibrate APOLLO range data against the newly-installed absolute calibration system and to characterize APOLLO performance and systematic errors.  Additionally, site geodetic measurements will be collected by an on-site superconducting gravimeter and a nearby global positioning system station, incorporating these data into the LLR analysis in order to constrain motion of the ground."

Research will focus on (1) using existing techniques to identify and remove non-astrophysical noise in the data stream, and (2) developing new methods to build predictive models for detector noise. Broader impacts on the development of gravitational-wave astrophysics will consist in improving LIGO's search pipelines and the performance of the detectors. Educational and public outreach initiatives will strengthen programs aimed at yielding knowledgeable teachers with enough physics content to effectively teach physics courses in school. New initiatives to promote science among diverse segments of the population will be developed through collaborations with educators in other disciplines.<br/><br/>Removing non-astrophysical artifacts from gravitational-wave data is crucial for reducing instrumental noise non-stationarity, extending the detector network duty cycle, and increasing the statistical significance of gravitational-wave candidate events. Improvements in these areas, in turn, boost parameter estimation of the gravitational-wave detections and enable refined astrophysical interpretations of the signals. Personnel funded under this award will analyze data from LIGO detector output and auxiliary sensors with the goal to isolate and identify sources of noise affecting LIGO's gravitational-wave searches. Results from these investigations will be fed back to LIGO Laboratory commissioners and instrumentation researchers to assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances. At the same time, Mississippi students and researchers will develop new, fast, reliable and accurate methods to model instrumental noise in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Machine learning-based algorithms, such as genetic programming, will be used to build predictive models to uncover the origin of non-astrophysical noise in the detectors."

Some of the most exciting advancements in our understanding of the universe can come from joint observations of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals, as was evident from the detection of merging neutron stars in August of 2017 by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations as well as electromagnetic telescopes around the world.  This project will enable prompt follow-up of detected gravitational-wave signals with electromagnetic telescopes by increasing the speed and accuracy with which gravitational-wave data from the LIGO detectors can be calibrated and disseminated to astrophysical analyses.  In addition to enabling the advancements in science that will be obtained from prompt multi-messenger astronomy, this project will also shepherd the next generation of scientists into this exciting field.  The project funds the development and expansion of a Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group that serves as a no-barrier-to-entry research opportunity for high school and early-career undergraduate students at Kenyon College and in the surrounding community.  This group has already launched several undergraduates into LIGO-related research projects, and this project will allow that pipeline to expand and improve access to a wide range of students.<br/><br/>The first step in gravitational-wave data analysis is the accurate and prompt reconstruction, or calibration, of the detector strain h(t). Currently the calibrated strain data is available to quick-response gravitational-wave searches in approximately 10 seconds with minimal information about the quality of the detector data. This project will propel LIGO data production into the future with very low-latency calibrated strain data, subtraction of noise in the calibrated strain data, and robust information about the quality of the strain data. This transformed data product would then be at the fingertips of quick-response gravitational-wave searches, thereby improving the ability of these searches to both find and quantify gravitational waves in the data.  The project incorporates undergraduates and high school students into this cutting-edge field.  Undergraduate students will be involved in implementing low-latency methods for removing noise from the strain data and using machine learning algorithms to provide predictions about the probability of loud, transient noise events being present in the data.  High school students and early undergraduate students will be initiated into the fields of astronomy and gravitational-wave physics through the Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group at Kenyon College.  ROAR students will perform astronomy observations and pulsar candidate identification that will contribute to the field of pulsar timing.  This program thereby establishes a research pipeline through which students can engage early in research opportunities and transition into advanced research areas.  The ROAR program brings scientific research and education opportunities to high school students in a rural area who would otherwise have little exposure to modern scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using its prior CMS data analysis experience, the KU group intends to use this new data to search for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model that describes the elementary particles known to date and explore the subatomic forces that interact with these elementary particles. The group also does significant work on public outreach efforts.  Its most unique outreach project is Quarked!TM Adventures in the Subatomic Universe, a multimedia project aimed at students age seven and up.

Sophisticated data analysis methods are needed to take full advantage of the improved sensitivity and make GW astronomy a reality.  Previous analyses have used simplifying assumptions about the detector noise, data calibration, and in some cases the GW signal itself, hindering our ability to make confident detection claims or accurately infer the nature of a GW signal. The research enabled by this award will advance GW data analysis by improving our ability to detect and characterize transient astrophysical signals.  The broad theme of the work supported by this award is to build a detailed model of LIGO data including instrument noise, calibration uncertainty, and GW signals.  The resulting data analysis methods will improve detection efficiency and reduce systematic errors in parameter estimation.  This award will also allow the PI to continue participating in impactful education and public outreach activities and to do so in a region of the United States which has little exposure to gravitational physics.  Outreach activities related to this award will include interactions with area high schools, colleges, and universities to publicize the exciting science being done by Advanced LIGO.<br/>  <br/>Research supported by this award will advance three main topics in LIGO data analysis:  (i) Un-modeled gravitational wave signals present a challenge for detection and parameter estimation because the signals are rare while transient noise events, or 'glitches', are common.  We will complete initial development and then continue to upgrade the BayesWave and BayesLine data analysis pipelines, which together are the state-of-the-art method for distinguishing between burst signals and glitches and drawing inferences about physical properties of the GW source.  (ii) The breakthrough technology used by BayesWave and BayesLine is a realistic model for the LIGO noise.  The deployment of this model is most mature in the burst analysis; however, all GW searches compete with the same instrument noise.  We will adapt the BayesLine algorithm to work with the parameter estimation pipeline, LALInference, for compact binary coalescence signals.  (iii)  The LIGO data must be calibrated, and there are small statistical uncertainties in amplitude and phase as a result.  Previous source characterization analyses have not incorporated uncertainty in the calibration in their data analysis method.  The BayesLine algorithm provides the foundation for modeling calibration errors and will be modified to account for systematic phase and amplitude uncertainty in compact binary and burst parameter estimation.

Yuan at the Michigan State University (MSU). <br/><br/>This project will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental nature of the physical universe --- the particles that comprise the universe and their interactions --- as revealed through sophisticated experiments in high-energy physics.  Our current understanding of this physics is embodied within the so-called Standard Model (SM).  Protons, neutrons, and all other strongly-interacting particles are composed of fundamental particles called partons (quarks and gluons), and interactions between these partons are described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  The proposed research involves the interplay between QCD theory and experimental data from many experiments, including recent experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  This global analysis of data is necessary in order to deepen our understanding of QCD, and to determine the distributions of the partons in the proton.  In particular, by understanding these distributions, it is possible to start with interactions of protons with protons (which are the interactions that actually occur at the LHC) and determine the underlying quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon interactions.  This is essential for determining the underlying physics of the process --- indeed, such information was necessary for extracting the signal for the recently-discovered Higgs boson from collider data.   Support for this project is therefore in the national interest because it furthers the development of fundamental science in the United States and enables the extraction of important data from collider experiments in which substantial national investments have already been made.   This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts since it will involve the training of students and postdoctoral fellows in theoretical high-energy physics both at Michigan State University and at summer schools held by the Coordinated Theoretical and Experimental QCD (CTEQ) collaboration.  <br/><br/>More technically, this research will focus on the development of CTEQ-TEA Parton Distribution Functions, earlier versions of which have already have been essential for the interpretation of data from the world's leading high-energy collider facilities such as Fermilab (Batavia, IL), RHIC (Brookhaven, NY), DESY (Hamburg, Germany), and CERN (Geneva, Switzerland).   The proposed research will also continue to refine world-leading contributions to lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collider phenomenology.  Complementary to the research on QCD, the group will also study the Electroweak (EW) sector of the Standard Model (SM), which is extremely successful in explaining and predicting  experimental data spanning a range in energy from the atomic scale to the Z boson, Higgs boson and top-quark masses.   Measurements of the production of W's, Z's, top-quark pairs, single top quarks and Higgs bosons at the LHC, including both inclusive rates and relevant kinematical distributions, will provide major new input into our understanding of parton distributions during the next few years.  At the same time, refinements of the parton distributions are necessary for progress in the EW sector, both for testing the SM at greater precision and for probing the effects of new physics at high-energy colliders."

With this and subsequent detections, LIGO is now operating as an astronomical observatory allowing us to explore the Universe using a completely new sense: gravitational waves. This award provides computing resources at UWM to analyze the LIGO data and will accelerate the discoveries enabled by the LIGO instruments. The computing cluster is designed to address the specific needs of Advanced LIGO data analysis. It is an integral part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) effort to analyze the full Advanced LIGO data sets. LIGO analysis activities will be prioritized on 90% of the cluster; other activities on the remaining 10% will include searches for radio pulsars/transients, the detection of gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays by NANOGrav, and numerical astrophysics.  Analyses to be run on the new cluster include searches for compact binaries and related parameter-estimation. The facility will be available to all 1000+ members of the LSC, and thus will have broad international impact. Moreover, these facilities have also been used by researchers at UWM and elsewhere for interdisciplinary research in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics.  This will continue, thus ensuring that this instrument will have a broad scientific reach at UWM and beyond. The deployment and use of this instrument will also provide a hands-on opportunity for education and training to undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral scientists and academic staff in the use of large-scale computing hardware to tackle complex technical questions.<br/><br/>The baseline computational instrument will consist of 720 execute nodes with 2,280 modern E3-1241v3 CPU cores. The group will add several high-memory login nodes, storage servers (1,152 TB gross storage) and networking equipment.  Theoretical peak performance will be about 300 TFLOPS (AVX2) with sufficient storage to host all of the calibrated data from advanced detectors (30 TB/yr) and several months of raw data (600 TB/yr).  Benchmarks indicate that the cluster will be able to process over 28 million template matches in real time. The scale of this project is commensurate with a new aspect of this mission within LIGO data analysis as a secondary site for running the real-time (latency of seconds) search for compact binary mergers -- a task best handled at a dedicated site such as UWM. This instrument will facilitate and participate the discovery and the study of the exotic astrophysical events throughout the Universe that produce gravitational waves.

The recently discovered Higgs boson is an excitation of a Higgs field that permeates all of space and gives mass to the other fundamental particles in the Universe.  Other fields, such as those that carry the electromagnetic and nuclear forces, interact with this Higgs field, and studying these interactions gives important insight into the properties of the Higgs field.  Ironically the interaction of gravity - the force we are most familiar with in our daily life - with the Higgs is hardly understood at all, due to the vast difference in strength between gravity and the other known forces.  The Higgs field may also interact with the mysterious material which gravitationally binds our galaxy together, and other as yet undiscovered constituents of nature.

The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations.<br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several projects at the cutting edge of hadron collider physics with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the energy frontier.  They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including service as co-conveners of major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector construction and operations.  They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas and a rich program of physics analyses and interpretations has originated from their efforts.  They plan to continue this innovation and leadership to further improve the capabilities of the detector and data analyses.  As the CMS detector ages, upgrades will need to be designed and implemented. This award will allow the Rutgers group to create an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as helping test and install the electronics for the hadron calorimeter.  They are also performing R&D work on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger.  They plan to host a production and testing facility for the upgrades. The Rutgers group hosts a large number of outreach activities which have a broad impact on the community.  Through the Rutgers QuarkNet program they run summer workshops at Rutgers for high-school teachers and students.  Students and teachers from across New Jersey analyze LHC data and build cosmic-ray telescopes.  They mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students.  These students work closely with the group's students and postdocs and contribute to ongoing studies and analyses. To combat the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women, and working to increase the participation of women in science.  They are active in promoting particle physics programs in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. After feedback from high school physics teachers, they are developing instructional programs for New Jersey high school physics teachers who need help teaching university-level physics courses. They are initiating outreach to the broader community with the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey to prepare particle physics related exhibits.  They continue to convey the excitement of particle physics with frequent talks at local high schools, libraries, and other venues."

Interpreting the scientific implications from these events and detecting additional sources of gravitational waves will make a significant contribution to our understanding of nature. Events seen by LIGO produce a wealth of astrophysical information and information on gravity theory. The extraction and interpretation of that information will require advanced techniques in data analysis, parameter estimation, statistics, and phenomenology. Detector characterization work will provide scientists with confidence in the quality of the data, and the performance of the detectors. Carleton College will continue with its efforts in identifying and characterizing noise in LIGO data. The use of LIGO to search for a stochastic gravitational wave background will continue at Carleton, and the Carleton team will continue to develop the implications of those results for astrophysics and gravitational physics. The team will also continue to develop the tools to perform and interpret multimessenger astrophysics.<br/><br/>Carleton College is a leader in producing future scientists. This project will provide research opportunities to students with interests in physics and related fields, and help train them to become the next generation of scientists. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravitational wave astronomy, tests of General Relativity, and science in general, is large. The methods and results developed as a consequence of this project have, and will continue to have, significant influence in other scientific fields: astrophysics, gravitational wave detectors in space, and alternative gravity theory. The project will continue to provide material that will improve teaching at the college level and it will create opportunities for scientific outreach at Carleton, in the local community, and in the K-12 schools. This outreach generates much excitement for science and physics. Finally, the research work of this project promotes international scientific collaboration. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916; a century later we observed them.

Dark matter is invisible, yet it is known to exist. Cosmological observations indicate that dark matter makes up 85% of all matter in the Universe yet its composition remains a mystery. Although the astronomical evidence of dark matter is overwhelming, so far nobody has detected it in the laboratory, and physicists know almost nothing about it. Many theoretical models for dark matter composition have been put forward. It is important to either confirm or rule out such models, particularly if this can be done cost-effectively. This project will use the existing Global Positioning System (GPS) as a planet-sized dark matter detector. This team will examine nearly two decades of publicly available archival data from atomic clocks onboard GPS satellites and search for transient effects of dark matter clumps on time kept by the GPS atomic clocks. Since the GPS system and its network of atomic clocks is already deployed, this is a relatively low-budget project with high potential payoff.   If such dark matter clumps exist and this project finds them, this would have an impact on the very foundations of cosmology and elementary particle physics. On the other hand, if dark matter clumps do not exist, it would be valuable to be able to rule this out categorically, to help science focus on more likely explanations. Either way, such investigations promote the progress of science.  This research will also contribute to improvements in the analysis of GPS data, and this can provide a benefit for many other applications such as geodesy that are also of value to society.   <br/><br/>Ambitious programs have been searching for dark matter (DM) in the form of heavy particles with no conclusive evidence, yet DM could also arise from ultralight quantum fields that form macroscopic objects. Such objects are predicted to cause apparent variations of fundamental constants, leading to transient shifts in atomic energy levels.  In its current project, the GPS.DM project team uses the orbiting network of atomic clocks on board GPS satellites as a 50,000-km-aperture detector to search for such DM objects.   As the Earth moves through the galactic DM halo, interactions with DM could cause a sequence of atomic clock perturbations that propagate through the satellite constellation at galactic velocities. Mining 16 years of archival data, the current project of GPS.DM finds no evidence for DM in the form of domain walls at current sensitivity levels, thereby improving the limits on certain quadratic scalar couplings by several orders of magnitude.  This project will expand the search to several different classes of extended DM objects and to dramatically improve data mining techniques. These techniques are anticipated to extend the discovery reach of the GPS dark matter detector by four orders of magnitude in the DM candidate mass parameter space and by two orders of magnitude in sensitivity.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Particle Astrophysics Experiment program and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Experiment program.

Observation and analysis of just this single event took weeks, and consumed a significant fraction of the human and computational resources of the global gravitational and astronomical communities. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole has recently identified a very high-energy (>PeV) neutrino and the Fermi and MAGIC observatories have identified high-energy gamma rays coincident in time and location with that neutrino. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) primary survey will start in late 2022, needing extra capacity to ensure the daily massive datasets are processed and coordinated with gravitational, particle, and other astronomical and astrophysical observations, and all in near- real-time and with very low latency. MMA needs now to address the challenges of this increase in the amount and complexity of data that will soon be upon us, as we start around-the-clock monitoring of frequent multi-messenger events. As such, this workshop on Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics will provide a forum for experts in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and Cyberinfrastracture to develop concepts for new community-scale data cyberinfrastructure for timely handling, processing, analysis, and modeling of multi-messenger astrophysical data. The workshop will be held at the Physical Science Complex at the University of Maryland on May 23-24, 2018.<br/><br/>This project advances the objectives of three of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" and ""Growing Convergent Research at NSF"".

Future observations by LIGO and its international partners will discover many more merging black hole pairs. These observations will help us understand how these systems formed and will let us test general relativity in the ultra-strong gravity region produced by these coalescing black holes. The work funded here is primarily concerned with: (i) improving our ability to model the signals LIGO will detect from black hole mergers; (ii) developing techniques to model and detect a component of gravitational-wave signals that can shed light on the nonlinear nature of gravity, the matter and energy ejected by supernovae, or the dynamics of compact stars that experience close flybys; and (iii) exploring science objectives that could be achieved by the next generation of gravitational-wave experiments. The educational components of this work include: (i) training undergraduate and master's degree students at a regional public university serving a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds; (ii) developing and making available instructional materials and hands-on kits that teach LIGO science; (iii) engaging the broader public through lectures, outreach exhibits, and the continued development of the ""Sounds of Spacetime"" website (which explains gravitational-wave science via an analogy with sound waves).<br/><br/> The science objectives of this work are focused on (i) improving models of merging binary systems with elliptical (eccentric) orbits and (ii) the gravitational-wave memory effect.  Elliptical binaries: LIGO currently has many signal models to analyze circular-orbit binaries, but few for elliptical binaries. The group will develop new signal models to handle eccentric orbits and investigate the implications for parameter estimation and testing general relativity. If present in LIGO signals, eccentricity will have implications for compact object binary formation models and constraining possible deviations from general relativity (which could be biased if eccentricity is neglected). Memory effect: The memory effect refers to a non-oscillatory component of the gravitational-wave signal. It is produced by gravitational two-body scattering, ejected matter or neutrinos in supernovae, and nonlinear interactions during black hole mergers. The effort will improve existing models of the memory effect. It will also develop, test, and execute a search for memory bursts using LIGO data. This will broaden the class of signals that LIGO investigates and could provide a new way to test general relativity."

Recent breakthroughs in neutrino oscillation experiments have revealed that they have tiny masses and have raised several intriguing questions.  Why are neutrinos so much lighter than the other particles? What is the absolute scale of the neutrino masses? And are the neutrinos their own antiparticles?   The keys to addressing these questions may lie in the search for a very rare decay process called neutrinoless double beta decay. During such a decay, two neutrons inside a nucleus simultaneously decay into two protons, emitting two electrons and no neutrino.   The goal of the project is to perform one of the most sensitive searches of this rare decay using data from the EXO-200 experiment.  A discovery of this elusive decay would signify that neutrinos are their own antiparticles; thus neutrinos obtain their masses differently from other particles.  The results may also shed light on the mystery of why there is more matter than anti-matter in the Universe.  In addition to his research on neutrinos, the principal investigator will also develop an educational program to strengthen science education at the middle-school level.  Specifically, the PI will organize workshops on middle-school physical science teaching in collaboration with the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and build closer connections between middle-school students and science majors at Illinois through a series of innovative outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will integrate research, outreach, and education around the development of novel analysis techniques to enhance the performance of large liquid xenon detectors such as EXO-200.  In its Phase-I operation, EXO-200 has demonstrated the unique capability of large liquid xenon detectors in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay in Xe-136.  With detector upgrades in 2016 and three years of additional Phase-II running, EXO-200 can improve by threefold its sensitivity to the Xe-136 neutrinoless double beta decay half-life.  The work focuses on the development of new analysis techniques to enhance the detector energy resolution and improve its background rejection capabilities, which are essential for maximizing the physics reach of EXO-200.  Understanding and demonstrating the ultimate performance of EXO-200 can provide essential inputs to the design of future tonne-scale detectors.  The analysis techniques to be developed can also be applied to large noble liquid detectors for particle physics experiments and medical imaging. In parallel, educational and outreach activities are planned to enhance middle school science education. The PI together with colleagues at Illinois will organize workshops for area middle school teachers on physical science teaching in accordance with the New Generation Science Standards and the development of hands-on classroom activities to implement the new standards.  The PI will also direct undergraduate volunteers in outreach to middle school students through demonstrations, an online forum, and assisting in school-initiated science programs."

In recent years, scientists have put together a remarkably successful model of cosmic evolution and the extraordinarily well tested Standard Model of elementary particles. In the current cosmological model, a rapid burst of expansion - inflation - occurred a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, laying the seeds for the formation of structure in the Universe. Those seeds have been observed as hot and cold regions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The assembly of galaxies from those seeds and the vast web of large-scale structure seen in galaxy surveys was shaped by dark matter, which dominates the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the evidence that the cosmic expansion is now accelerating has become incontrovertible, pointing to a Universe dominated by dark energy or else to a modification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>The success of the current cosmology rests upon its three mysterious pillars - inflation, particle dark matter, and dark energy - mysterious because they lie outside the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmology has shown that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there is new physics waiting to be discovered. In the coming decade, cosmology can help reveal the new physics underlying inflation, dark matter, and cosmic acceleration, and thereby play a critical role in pointing the way to a new paradigm for fundamental physics. The Physics Frontier Center at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) will bring together astronomers and physicists, theorists, observers and experimentalists, and early-career scientists and senior researchers from across the cosmology community. Since the complexity of these problems requires multiple, complementary approaches, the Center will enable datasets from different experiments to be combined in powerful new ways. As new discoveries are made, the Center will pursue new directions to promptly follow them up. <br/><br/>Building upon the accomplishments, investments, and lessons learned over the past ten years of PFC funding, the Center focuses upon reaping the science from the projects that were initiated and developed at the KICP - South Pole Telescope (SPT), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET), and Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics (COUPP) - and elsewhere to help solve these big mysteries. Built around the projects, the Center includes eight Major Activities (MAs), five research Hubs, an international Fellows exchange program, yearly hands-on summer schools, and multiple Education & Outreach partnerships. Twenty-one key collaborators have committed to carrying out specific tasks central to the Center. They come from local institutions, education and outreach partners, institutions around the country, and industry. <br/><br/>Three science MAs are devoted to our research themes: the Inflation MA will take advantage of dramatic advances in measuring CMB polarization to pursue the ""Bmode"" polarization signature of inflation-produced gravity waves, focusing initially on QUIET and SPTpol while laying the groundwork for future experiments. It will also combine CMB and large-scale structure measurements from DES to test whether the underlying density perturbations are Gaussian, as predicted by the simplest models of inflation. The Dark Energy MA will use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) and other future projects to probe the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and test the current paradigm - vacuum energy within Einstein's theory of gravity. The Dark Matter MA will synthesize the upcoming wealth of data from particle colliders, satellites, and ultra-sensitive dark matter detectors to confirm or refute the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) hypothesis for dark matter.<br/><br/>Within the three science MAs, five research ""Hubs"" will bring people and projects together to focus on specific challenges. The CMB Polarization Hub will facilitate coordination between different polarization experiments, including joint analysis; the non-Gaussianity Hub will bring together international researchers to constrain or detect non-Gaussianity and test inflation. The Joint Analysis Hub will bring together researchers on SPT and DES and other projects to develop and apply new tools to exploit and optimize galaxy clusters as probes of dark energy; the Supernova Hub will carry out a broad program to improve supernovae as cosmological distance indicators and apply these techniques to new surveys. The Dark Matter Hub will focus on particle theory and model building and signals for dark matter from colliders and indirect detection experiments, complementing the direct detection experiment COUPP and others.<br/><br/>The Fellows MA is the centerpiece activity of the Center. Mentored by the faculty of the Center but given great independence, eleven early-career scientists will be able to shape research programs of their own design, work with faculty, other Fellows, students, and visitors in the interdisciplinary environment of the Center.  They can also participate in an international Fellows exchange program and choose from a broad range of opportunities in education and outreach. All of this is designed to prepare them to be future leaders in cosmology.<br/><br/>Two MAs are devoted to crosscutting, science-enabling activities. Detector Development, strongly leveraged by partnerships with Argonne, Fermilab, and other institutions, will develop innovative detectors to position us to take advantage of early discoveries and to broadly benefit cosmology and other areas of science.  Computational Cosmology will coordinate the high-performance computing resources, both human and hardware, necessary to accomplish our science goals. The Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will provide a program of specialized workshops, large symposia, yearly hands-on summer schools, and a visitors program featuring the David Schramm Distinguished Visiting Professorship to engage and benefit the broader cosmology community and further our science goals.<br/><br/>By design, the broader impacts of the PFC are woven throughout the Center activities. More specifically, the Education, Outreach, & Diversity MA, will spearhead and coordinate a series of activities aimed at broadening the impact of the Center. This MA is strongly coupled to the science in the Center, involves 100% of the PFC faculty members, and has three overarching goals: increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce through programs from K-12 to the professoriate; educating and preparing the next generation of teacher-scholars in an interdisciplinary environment by involving students and Fellows directly in outreach and teaching activities; and advancing the public's understanding and appreciation of science through collaborations with museums and planetariums, and through public lectures and events. This approach to broadening participation includes collaboration with Project Exploration working with the Chicago Public Schools, continuation of the successful Space Explorers K-12 program, partnering with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program and the University of Texas El Paso to bring students to UChicago for research experiences, supporting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and championing diversity in faculty hiring and retention within the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. The Center will also use technology, developing visualization tools, to integrate research into the undergraduate curriculum and will partner with the Adler Planetarium on cosmology visualizations for a broader audience. Finally, the Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will promote dissemination of cutting-edge research to the broader cosmology community and offer opportunities for those not currently engaged in cosmology research to transition into the field."

It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award provides funding for the University of Alabama (UA) group to search for a particular type (""flavor"") of neutrino, the tau neutrino, in the IceCube data. Tau neutrinos have a negligible background from the atmosphere and would be a certain sign of astrophysical origin as well as offering insight into neutrino physics and oscillation in distant sources.<br/><br/>The PI will continue and enhance high school outreach by hosting an IceCube Masterclass: a one day event which gives high school students the chance to work with real IceCube data. The PI will develop a new Masterclass activity based on the UA group's tau neutrino research. The PI participates in public outreach activities that highlight IceCube's unique location and science goals.<br/><br/>If the astrophysical neutrino flux arises from pion decay as a result of cosmic ray acceleration in shocks, and assuming standard neutrino oscillation parameters, the detected neutrinos at Earth should consist of equal fractions of electron, muon and tau neutrinos. However, tau neutrinos have yet to be unambiguously identified in the astrophysical neutrino flux. The group will build on a proven track record in the tau neutrino channel and extend the search to lower energies and to previously unexplored signatures. With three more years of IceCube data, lower energy thresholds and increased signal sensitivity, tau neutrinos could be detectable by the end of the funding period."

One way they do this is by observing what happens when counter-rotating beams of protons collide. The characteristics of the debris produced in the collisions can reveal the basic physics of fundamental particles and the forces between them. Highly sophisticated particle detectors and analysis methods are required to measure these characteristics. NSF provides funding to US researchers to conduct research in experimental high energy physics using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world?s premier laboratory for this research. In addition to directly supporting research activities, NSF will provide, via this award, funding to twenty-nine US universities to maintain the operation of US-supplied components of the CMS detector and its supporting software and computing systems, carry out technical planning and development that will enable future enhancements to CMS?s detection capabilities, and promote science education and outreach. The Large Hadron Collider is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva Switzerland.<br/><br/>US participation in CMS will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advancing the multidisciplinary application of technology, and the popularization and dissemination of science to the general public. The award will support activities that provide opportunities to develop and maintain complex detector apparatus, custom analog and digital electronics and software systems for data management, data processing and technical analysis. Technical professionals are required to perform many of these tasks, increasing the expertise of the US work force. The operation of existing detector components, design of upgrade components, and related research activities create opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration among university physics personnel, university personnel in engineering departments, and physics department technical personnel as  physicists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and computer scientists work with post-docs and students. Similarly, physics personnel will work closely with computing professionals at their home institutions and at national laboratories to support the various software and computing activities.<br/>Technical part: This award supports the development and operation of the instrumentation and analysis tools that are essential to studying debris from proton-proton collisions. These tools are essential for answering basic, foundational questions, such as ?What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles?? The Higgs Boson discovery, a physical manifestation of the mechanism that generates elementary particle masses, led to the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize that was awarded to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Is that the end of the story, or are there other, as-of-yet undiscovered, contributions to this process?

One way they do this is by observing what happens when counter-rotating beams of protons collide. The characteristics of the debris produced in the collisions can reveal the basic physics of fundamental particles and the forces between them. Highly sophisticated particle detectors and analysis methods are required to measure these characteristics. NSF provides funding to US researchers to conduct research in experimental high energy physics using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world?s premier laboratory for this research. In addition to directly supporting research activities, NSF will provide, via this award, funding to twelve US universities to maintain the operation of US-supplied components of the ATLAS detector and its supporting software and computing systems, carry out technical planning and development that will enable future enhancements to ATLAS?s detection capabilities, and promote science education and outreach. The Large Hadron Collider is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva Switzerland.<br/>US participation in ATLAS will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advancing the multidisciplinary application of technology, and the popularization and dissemination of science to the general public. The award will support activities that provide opportunities to develop and maintain complex detector apparatus, custom analog and digital electronics and software systems for data management, data processing and technical analysis. Technical professionals are required to perform many of these tasks, increasing the expertise of the US work force. The operation of existing detector components, design of upgrade components, and related research activities create opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration among university physics personnel, university personnel in engineering departments, and physics department technical personnel as  physicists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and computer scientists work with post-docs and students. Similarly, physics personnel will work closely with computing professionals at their home institutions and at national laboratories to support the various software and computing activities.<br/>Technical part: This award supports the development and operation of the instrumentation and analysis tools that are essential to studying debris from proton-proton collisions. These tools are essential for answering basic, foundational questions, such as ?What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles?? The Higgs Boson discovery, a physical manifestation of the mechanism that generates elementary particle masses, led to the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize that was awarded to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Is that the end of the story, or are there other, as-of-yet undiscovered, contributions to this process?

It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award provides funding for the scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the scientific analysis of data taken with the IceCube neutrino detector. The study of neutrino oscillations and the ongoing correlation studies between the arrival directions of cosmic neutrinos and high-energy photons are only two of a large range of current analyses, illustrating that discoveries are at best in initial stages.<br/><br/>The mystique of the South Pole environment and the compelling science of IceCube are an alluring mix. IceCube results have already enhanced scientific and technological understanding on many levels and have inspired the innovative capacity of a new generation of American scientists and engineers. The Madison group will continue to make IceCube science and resources available to existing education and outreach programs with a proven record of success. The group is also a partner of a new program, called ""El Universo es Tuyo"" (the Universe is Yours), to engage the Hispanic community in and around Madison in learning about research and STEM careers in astronomy and astrophysics.<br/><br/>DeepCore, a densely instrumented infill array in the bottom half of the IceCube detector, has lowered the sensitivity threshold to 10 GeV. The Madison group participates in the development of analysis techniques that specialize to DeepCore data. They will result in improved measurements of the atmospheric oscillation parameters. The accumulating cosmic neutrino events indicate an enhancement of the flux below 100 TeV that may hint at another component in the cosmic neutrino spectrum."

Dark matter is  invisible, yet it is known to exist with about five times more abundance in the universe than the ordinary matter (like stars) we can see.  Although the astronomical evidence of dark matter is overwhelming, so far nobody has detected it in the laboratory, and we know almost nothing about it.  Many attempts to seek dark matter as fundamental particles of nature have so far failed.  Our project will search for a different possible type of dark matter known as topological defects, predicted by some models of how the universe formed.  Our approach to detect topological defects is by observing their predicted effect on atomic clocks, the most precise instruments ever devised.  Specifically, we will use existing data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and seek the tiny effects of dark matter on time kept by atomic clocks connected to GPS instruments. Since the GPS system and the atomic clocks already exist and are paid for, this is a relatively low-budget project with high potential payoff.  If topological defects do exist and we find them, this would help set our understanding of the universe on a more sure footing.  Likewise, it would also be valuable to be able to rule out this possibility with a small margin of error, to help science focus on more likely explanations. In this way, such investigations promote the progress of science.  Society also benefits in terms of new technologies that can only be made possible with the unpredictable knowledge that comes with scientific progress.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the nature of dark matter remains one of top outstanding problems in physics today.  Some models predict dark matter in a form of stable configurations of light fields, the topological defects (TD).  The presence of TDs may lead to occasional transient changes of particle masses and coupling constants, thus giving a distinct signature that can be searched for with the network of sensitive atomic clocks. This project will use atomic clocks of the existing GPS satellite constellation and ground station network as a 50,000 km-aperture sensor array.  Data from this detector have been accumulated over 15 years and are publicly available. The PI, an expert in precision positioning and timing, will conduct the GPS data processing by customizing the NASA/JPL software GIPSY/OASIS of which he is a co-author. The output will be a time series of clock phase for all GPS satellites and ground stations, which we have demonstrated can be monitored with a precision of ~0.1 ns.  If DM exists in the form of macroscopic TDs, then there is a chance to discover this with this macroscopic experiment. Assuming TDs exist in sufficient abundance, then the Earth would pass through these TDs occasionally. For TDs that pass through the GPS system at galactic speeds ~300 km/sec, TDM-SM coupling would lead to transients in fundamental physical constants, which would cause a sequence of transients in atomic clock frequency, hence producing step-like functions in clock phase across an aperture of ~200 s for the GPS constellation, and ~40 s for ground stations. Since GPS carrier phase data is routinely acquired with few-mm precision at intervals of 1 s, detecting ~1 ns signals in the atomic clock phase over a 200-s aperture is easily achievable. Observing such a signature would provide decisive evidence of the existence of TDs with a high confidence level, as there is no known mechanism for background events that would mimic such a signature. Non-observation will place constraints on certain new-physics couplings."

One of the key missions of LIGO and Virgo is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous and violently changing. Gravitational waves encode invaluable information about this extreme gravity regime, especially in the waves produced when black holes and neutron stars collide. The main objective of this award is to develop ready-to-use models to extract and interpret gravitational waves emitted in eccentric and precessing collisions, so that these models can be used to study astrophysics and test General Relativity with future observations. This research will be integrated with broader impact activities aimed at changing the attitudes of K-12 students and the general public toward physics and science through activities that will be developed in the eXtreme Gravity Institute at Montana State University, a fertile training ground for the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at (i) the development of analytic, ready-to-use models for the orbital dynamics and gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of generic compact binaries (black hole and neutron star binaries with arbitrary spin and eccentricity), and (ii) the use of these models to analyze and interpret current and future ground-based gravitational wave data to study astrophysics and experimental relativity implications. The gravitational wave models used currently are restricted to (at most nearly) quasi-circular inspirals with (typically) spins aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum (or to simple-precession-like approximations). Such models are sufficient for the detection and characterization of current GW observations, but as advanced LIGO is upgraded to reach design sensitivity and third-generation detectors are constructed, more accurate models will be needed. Not only will these models prevent the biasing of parameter estimation due to mis-modeling systematics, but the additional information they encode will allow for more accurate parameter estimation and the extraction of new information from the data. This new information, such as the orbital eccentricity and the spin vector components, can inform astrophysical population models, as well as allow for new tests of General Relativity in the mostly-unexplored, extreme gravity regime. The proposed research includes the implementation of the ready-to-use models in data analysis studies to determine the astrophysics and experimental-relativity information that can be extracted from current and future gravitational wave data. This research will be integrated with broader impact activities aimed at changing the attitudes of K-12 students and the general public toward physics and science. ""The Art of Physics"" activity is an art competition and residency program in the Department of Physics at MSU, in which undergraduate students will be educated in cutting-edge physics and create art works that convey its concepts. The art pieces will compete at a juried exhibition, with the winning artist becoming the resident artist in physics for the next year. The ""Learn to Fail"" activity is an art installation in which Montana State University faculty will share their failure stories with the MSU student population and general public on camera while contrasting their biggest achievements. Through this juxtaposition between failures and successes, the installation will generate an honest dialogue about the role and meaning of failure in academia. ""eXtreme Gravity for Middle School? are fully-formed, standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers aimed at supporting them in learning how to deliver content on topics including gravitational lensing, neutron stars, black holes and gravitational waves to middle school students. Other activities include a black-hole themed bout for the local roller derby team, public talks given by the PI, and continued STEM mentoring for middle-school students from local schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and envisioned successors are probing new physics at the energy frontier and are capable of providing answers to important questions about the structure and history of the universe. On the other hand, cosmology provides a unique laboratory in which to study questions in physics inaccessible to traditional particle physics methods, and forms a valuable complement to accelerators. Our current understanding of the fundamental problems about the origin, evolution and future of our universe is still in its infancy, and a synthesis of many independent lines of evidence will be necessary to point the way to explanations. This project reflects that synergy, and promises to make significant progress in connecting high-precision cosmological and accelerator data to fundamental questions such as the origin and evolution of the universe, the unification of gravitation with quantum mechanics, the role of the vacuum in the structure of space and time. As a result, research in these areas advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. In addition, this project will involve graduate students and postdocs, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. The PIs will also continue presenting the latest scientific results to the public at large in the form of public talks and various outreach activities. Kinney will also continue organizing Science and Art Cabaret --- a unique mix of cutting-edge science and technology with art, music, poetry, and performance.<br/><br/>More technically, Wackeroth will concentrate on improving predictions for key SM measurements at the LHC by calculating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections and implementing them in publicly available Monte Carlo event generators for realistic simulations. The comparison of experimental data with these improved predictions will probe the Standard Model with unprecedented precision and provide increased sensitivity to signals of new physics. The main thrust of Kinney's planned research for the next several years is to make quantitative connections between new observational Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and detailed properties of the early universe in order to address fundamental questions such as: What is the energy scale of cosmological inflation?  What is the form of the leading-order operator in the inflationary potential? Is the inflationary Lagrangian consistent with a simple canonical field theory? Is there evidence for quantum gravity effects, for example a Planck-scale cutoff in quantum modes? Can we explain CMB anomalies, such as the hemispherical asymmetry observed by Planck? Are there viable alternatives to inflation? What properties do they have?  Finally, Stojkovic will focus on LHC physics, in particular on further development of a comprehensive LHC event generator BlackMax which is extensively used by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in search for exotic physics."

Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). <br/><br/>Following the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination.

Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities. As a centerpiece to tie together these outreach activities, the group plans to develop a Visitor Center at Nevis Labs that will occupy both physical and virtual spaces and provide a focal point for visiting groups to learn about the history and current research at Nevis."

One of the open questions in nuclear science, as identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, is: what is the origin of the elements?  To produce nuclei having more than a few neutrons and protons requires a sequence of nuclear reactions that take place in stars.  To produce nuclei heavier than iron requires a highly energetic environment, such as a supernova explosion or a neutron star merger.  The equipment to be built here, the Separated Capture Reaction (SECAR) spectrometer, will enable physicists at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) to measure rare nuclear reactions that are necessary to understand the origin of the elements.  Phase 2 of the SECAR spectrometer, planned here, will become a world-leading facility for this purpose.<br/><br/>SECAR Phase 2 opens a wide range of science opportunities. It enables measurements of the entire range of important reactions in X-ray bursts, the most common thermonuclear explosions observed in our Galaxy. X-ray bursts occur on the surface of mass-accreting neutron stars. With the SECAR Phase 2 data, burst observations can be used to probe the properties of neutron stars and X-ray binary systems. In addition, predictions can be made of the elements created that form the crust of the neutron star and may also, in part, be ejected into space. SECAR Phase 2 will also enable predictions of the element signatures of astrophysical Nova explosions, especially unusually energetic events that may be observed with new telescopes in the near future. This will help to identify the signatures of these events in observational data, and in the composition of meteoritic grains found on earth. SECAR Phase 2 data will also help understand the production of radioactive elements in supernovae, the signatures of the most massive stars ever that existed in the early universe, the contribution of supernova neutrino winds to the origin of the elements, and help prove, or disprove, the existence of Thorne-Zytkov objects, hypothetical stellar objects that contain a neutron star as their core."

It occurs where a magnetic field embedded in a superheated (ionized) gas, a plasma, changes directions and rapidly releases large amounts of energy into the plasma.  The project will also contribute to understanding of plasma turbulence, where energy injected at large scales cascades down to small dissipation scales.  This project will pursue a systematic approach to determining where dissipation occurs in plasmas.  The approach is to develop the tools to apply the concept of entropy, known since the late 19th century, to this modern problem where it has been underutilized.  This project has the capability to be truly transformative to the field of geospace sciences since it will provide the infrastructure for using entropy as a diagnostic for dissipation which should be useful in many subareas of this field, and will be directly comparable to existing satellite measurements.  It fosters education through the support of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The goal is to perform the first systematic study using kinetic entropy as a diagnostic for dissipation in reconnection and turbulence, and to compare the results with observational data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale space mission.  The kinetic diagnostic was recently developed for particle-in-cell (PIC) codes by the research team, so the new diagnostic will be used to assess the numerical dissipation in collisionless PIC codes and implemented into a collisional PIC code that self-consistently contains dissipation.  The two will be compared to provide strong insights into where dissipation occurs and what physical mechanism causes it.  As needed, the results will be compared directly with a new Vlasov-Maxwell solver that was recently developed by a collaborator at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The simulation study will be carried out on standard test problems in magnetic reconnection and turbulence.  The expected contribution of this work will be a systematic approach to study dissipation in nearly collisionless systems which can broadly be used for plasma science, and a newfound understanding of what causes irreversible dissipation in reconnection and turbulence.

This grant supports the work of members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration at Kenyon College.  Kenyon LIGO group members have lead roles in the calibration of the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) interferometers and the search for gravitational wave signals from large black holes.  The calibration of the aLIGO detectors is the first fundamental step after data has been collected by the detector.  Only after the data is calibrated can searches for gravitational wave signals begin.  LIGO scientists search for a range of sources, but the most promising source is the coalescence of two compact, astrophysical objects, such as black holes and neutron stars.  Historically, LIGO has performed careful searches for black hole systems with masses that range up to 100 times the mass of the Sun.  Members of the Kenyon LIGO group are part of the effort to expand this search to black holes of even higher masses.  These large black holes may hold key answers as to how the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies were formed.   Additionally, the Kenyon LIGO group is exploring and improving aLIGO's ability to extract information about the matter that composes neutron stars in preparation for the first gravitational wave detection from a coalescing neutron star system.  While electromagnetic signals from binary neutron star systems can provide insight into the surface of neutron stars, the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system could dig deeper and reveal secrets of the illusive neutron star matter itself.  Finally, this project also supports the expansion of an existing NSF-funded outreach program at Kenyon College that targets engaging middle-school-aged audiences with exciting, hands-on science workshops.  Separate workshops are held for middle school boys (LADS: Learning and Doing Science) and middle school girls (GSS: Girls Science Saturdays) several Saturdays throughout the school year. <br/><br/>This award supports three main efforts in the field of gravitational-wave physics.  The first is related to ongoing work in the calibration of the aLIGO detectors.  Specifically, Kenyon LIGO group members will not only maintain existing low-latency calibration software, which is a large task as the calibration procedure is constantly changing with upgrades to the interferometers, but they will also work towards reducing the latency of the current calibration software from around a few tens of seconds down to a few seconds.  The lowest possible latency calibration is crucial for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave signal candidates.  The main methods that will be employed to reduce the latency of the calibration software are to reduce the complexity of the procedure, shift as much of the calibration procedure as possible into the real-time instrument computers, and improve the computational efficiency of all existing calibration software.  The award also supports the development and execution of a modeled, matched-filter search for intermediate mass black hole binary (IMBHB) systems.  The goal of the search is to make the first confident detection of black holes in the intermediate mass range or to provide upper limits on the existence of IMBHB systems.  Existing search software is being optimized to fit the needs of a higher mass, and therefore shorter waveform, matched filter search, and the search is being developed to run in a low-latency mode during future observing runs.  Finally, this grant supports the development of tools to extract information about the neutron star equation of state from a binary neutron star gravitational wave detection.  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) gravitational wave parameter estimation software is being modified to more optimally explore the neutron star equation of state parameter space, and software to allow for the use of different models of the neutron star equation of state is being developed. The first few gravitational wave detections from binary neutron star systems will be able to provide a wealth of new knowledge about neutron star matter."

Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community.  For example, the material from which stars and planets form, interstellar clouds, and even planetary rings all consist of dusty plasma. Dusty plasmas are also present on the Earth, particularly in industrial plasma applications, while the controlled formation of dust crystals in a laboratory setting provides a useful analog for both atomic and molecular systems, allowing fundamental progress in our understanding of the physics involved. As such, dusty plasma research enables the progress of science while allowing insight into practical issues of yield efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing. This award will also impact the STEM workforce through engagement of students who will develop computation and modeling skills, obtain practical experience with instrumentation, and improve their technical writing and presentation skills. <br/><br/>A proper understanding of the physics underlying the field of dusty plasma research is complicated by the fact that the majority of research conducted occurs in a gravitational environment (i.e., on the Earth). This project directly addresses this issue, utilizing a multinational collaboration to compare studies on self-ordering of interacting complex plasma dust particles collected on the Earth to experimental results employing the PK-4 facility under microgravity. Data obtained will be compared with data from two different ground-based experiments as well as to results provided by numerical modeling of the plasma / dust environment using a comprehensive set of analysis techniques. This combination will be used to define the parameter space where particular wave modes can exist, and to develop comprehensive theories on interparticle potential and grain-plasma interactions, determining the microscopic and macroscopic properties of the complex plasma.  The results obtained will directly impact research in astrophysics and planetary science (e.g., dust in protoplanetary disks, charged dust on the surface of airless bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, planetary ring systems), atmospheric physics (e.g., noctilucent clouds), fusion research (e.g., dust contamination), materials physics (e.g., soft matter, metastable states, complex fluids, granular matter), and advanced manufacturing (e.g., semiconductor, etching, and deposition systems).

The significance of this possibility is that energy in eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction.  This possibility can be particularly important in an ionized gas, a plasma. First, plasma can be inviscid on the time scales of compression, such as occurs naturally in certain molecular clouds or, in the laboratory, in Z-pinches, thereby enabling the increase of turbulent energy.  Second, there are important processes in plasma, such as radiation or nuclear fusion, whose efficiency is highly dependent on this relative motion.  A case in point is the Z-pinch, which is a cylindrical plasma device where current running in the axial direction produces a magnetic field that compresses plasma radially.  Recent spectroscopic data taken at the Weizmann Institute of Science suggests that the energy in a Z-pinch can be dominated by the motion of hydrodynamic turbulent eddies.<br/><br/>It has been previously shown that self-consistent accounting for the turbulent eddy energy leads to greater consistency in the stagnation Z-pinch data.  One aspect of the present project is to use this approach to develop a quasi equation of state for compressing turbulence.  It was also predicted that, under compression, plasma abruptly becomes viscous, so that there can be a sudden catastrophic release of the turbulent energy into random ion energy, thereby suddenly enabling processes that rely on thermal motion. Thus, a second aspect of the project is to explore both the ramifications of this curious effect, which occurs in plasma but not neutral gas, as well as to explore how this effect may be affected under a variety of experimental conditions.  This work will involve collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interactions of even a small number of objects can be challenging to understand.  The ""few body problem"" (FBP) of physics refers to scenarios where three or more objects mutually affect each other's trajectories.  These scenarios arise in the gravitational interactions of planets and stars and in the electromagnetic interactions of atoms, ions, and electrons.  At the microscopic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also affect particle motions. The resulting dynamics are challenging to predict, but can be important for understanding atomic collisions and basic reactions. This project will study atom-electron-ion scattering to test new theories about the FBP in atomic systems. In particular, when the particles in the FBP obey the laws of quantum mechanics, then the wave-particle duality is important. This project will investigate how the nonlocal spatial extent, or coherence length, of the quantum mechanical waves that represent the particles can affect the way particles scatter from one another. This will lead to improved understanding of reaction cross sections and scattering theory. Many areas of science well beyond atomic physics are also concerned with the quantum mechanical FBP. Therefore, this research is relevant to a broad range of disciplines in science including nuclear physics, chemical physics, plasma science, and accelerator physics. Students working on this project will gain research experience with a broad range of experimental atomic physics technologies and theoretical analysis methods. <br/><br/>Kinematically complete experiments will be performed that address two major themes. First, the reaction dynamics will be investigated for collisions under a broad range of conditions including some regimes with electron speeds close to the projectile speed. Second, projectile coherence effects, which concern a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, will be studied. Such experiments simultaneously determine the momentum vectors of all involved particles, i.e. the scattered projectiles, any ejected electron, and the recoiling residual target ions. From the data, reaction probabilities (cross sections) will be extracted as a function of numerous parameters. The data will provide sensitive tests of sophisticated theoretical models that depend on the transverse coherence length of the projectile beams. To better test these models the divergence of the beams, and hence the de Broglie wave coherence for the projectiles, will be manipulated in the experiment. In this way the impact of the projectile wave properties on the few-body dynamics in charged-particle interactions with atoms will be studied."

It predicts the existence of bizarre objects like black holes and neutron stars, and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These predictions motivated the construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has detected several gravitational wave signals from colliding black holes and one signal from colliding neutron stars so far. For their efforts in making these detections possible, the leaders of LIGO were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. To obtain a deeper understanding about what produced the observed gravitational waves, LIGO data analysis compares observed waves with those predicted by Einstein's theory of GR for a very large number of possible scenarios. Construction of reliable theoretical models requires the full solutions to the equations underlying GR, provided by the field of numerical relativity. This project builds upon recent advances in this field to develop new software that greatly reduces the cost (in memory) of generating these solutions. Where before numerical relativity largely depended upon supercomputers, this new software will enable even consumer-grade desktop computers to generate needed theoretical predictions of merging black holes needed for LIGO data analysis. In the latter half of the funding period, the software will be made supercomputer-capable to enable (the far more memory-hungry) simulations of merging neutron stars on supercomputers with state-of-the-art accuracy. By unlocking the consumer-grade desktop as a powerful tool for numerical relativity, this project has the potential to enable the public to participate in the science in unprecedented ways. This will be made possible by incorporating this software into SETI@Home's ""BOINC"" volunteer computing infrastructure. The hope is that when LIGO detects a pair of merging black holes, thousands of black hole merger calculations will be launched for the benefit of LIGO science, each on a consumer-grade desktop computer running our ""BlackHoles@Home"" software. To educate the public and advertise this volunteer computing project both locally and globally, the West Virginia University group will give convocations in nearby high schools and write articles for the widely aggregated news site ""The Conversation"".<br/><br/>Numerical relativity (NR) solves Einstein's equations of general relativity (GR), in full, on the computer. Improvements to the algorithmic and mathematical underpinnings of NR codes have recently culminated in a coming-of-age for the field, moving it beyond proof-of-principle calculations and into the realm of predictive astrophysics. Over the past two years, NR-based theoretical predictions of gravitational waves (GWs) were central to uncovering the binary parameters in LIGO's recent GW discoveries. Now that the age of multi-messenger astrophysics has arrived, physical scenarios involving gravitational field and magnetized fluid dynamics spanning orders of magnitude in length scale and timescale will need to be modeled. NR codes bridge these scales by dynamically adjusting their spatial numerical grids to better sample the space, but current algorithms do not account for near-symmetries in these systems or rely on complex mesh algorithms. The proposed project involves the development of a new NR code with the unique goal of being both algorithmically simple and highly efficient, minimizing computational and human effort while maximizing scientific impact. We call it SENR, the Simple, Efficient NR code. SENR is unique in its aim to perform NR simulations of compact binary inspirals atop a single, dynamical, bispherical-like spatial grid. Exploiting near-symmetries in the underlying system can reduce computational cost over the most widely-adopted NR methods by orders of magnitude, and minimizing the grid management infrastructure greatly simplifies the interpretation of numerical errors and the addition of new physics modules. SENR builds on a new, highly-robust approach in NR for solving the GR field equations with hydrodynamics on static curvilinear spatial grids with coordinate singularities (e.g., spherical polar coordinates), and the PI's team is extending the approach to arbitrary, dynamical coordinate systems. Development of SENR is accelerated by a Python-based code-generation tool developed for this project called NRPy+. Following best-practices in software design, the small SENR codebase is carefully optimized after each major feature is added to maximize scientific impact. SENR's memory efficiency unlocks the desktop as a tool for NR, enabling us to launch the first major volunteer computing effort to generate an enormous NR-based GW catalog for binary black holes. Further, SENR's scalability will enable us to leverage supercomputing resources to generate a very large double neutron star GW catalog as well. Simplicity in infrastructure greatly reduces effort required to add new physics modules, and we plan to incorporate Monte-Carlo-based photon and neutrino feedback to enable state-of-the-art realism in our compact binary simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atomic clocks have been instrumental in the advancement of science and technology in the twentieth century, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advance communications, and tests of fundamental particle physics. A next generation optical atomic clock would extend the capabilities of these systems and will enable a renaissance of timing applications such as enhanced security for data routing and communications, advanced earth and space time-based navigation, geophysical surveying, testing Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and searches for variations in the fundamental constants of the universe. Laser cooling is a technique for which the mechanical action of light is used to reduce the velocity of an atom in a gas. The use of lasers to cool atoms opened up new frontiers in physics ranging from the formation of new states of matter to enabling novel nanotechnologies. The extension of laser cooling to a new atomic species will enable the creation of novel ultracold atomic systems with unique properties and dynamics. The goal of this project is to investigate the atomic physics properties and implement laser cooling of atomic gadolinium for its potential use as an optical frequency standard and as a step to create new research avenues in atomic physics cross-fertilized with condensed matter physics. More specifically, these experiments will use lasers as a probe to determine the influence of external perturbations that limits its accuracy as an atomic clock. In addition, the spectral features of gadolinium will be characterized as a diagnostic tool to determine its cooling limits. This specific milestone will enable a gadolinium optical clock of greater accuracy and the realization of exotic ultracold quantum physics systems. This research program will support and train undergraduate and graduate students to become the next generation of scientists and engineers for fundamental and applied research in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. <br/><br/><br/>This project is an experimental research program directed towards investigating collisional and spectroscopic properties of atomic gadolinium (Gd). Gd is a novel class of atom that has an exotic electronic configuration and large ground state magnetic moment, which allows it to have submerged shell optical clock transitions, ultracold collisions having ground state angular momentum, and exotic quantum gas phases and phenomenon dominated by dipole-dipole forces. In particular, the collision studies involve measurements of collision quenching cross sections, and pressure broadening and shifts of the atomic states and line shapes of the optical clock and laser cooling transitions inside a Gd vapor cell. The objective is to characterize the collision sensitivity of these atomic transitions to give insight into the combined action of electron screening and configurational interactions. In addition, the radiative lifetimes, hyperfine structure, and isotope shifts of identified intercombination laser cooling transitions will be determined using laser induce fluorescence spectroscopy with an atomic beam. The determination of these spectroscopic properties are necessary for implementing narrow-line laser cooling for both bosonic and fermonic isotopes of gadolinium. Narrow-line laser cooling is essential for achieving quantum degeneracy with gadolinium, since its large ground state magnetic moment prevents evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap. In addition, laser cooling and trapping using electric-dipole transitions will be executed to create a magneto-optical trap of gadolinium as a first step towards performing precision measurements, investigating ultracold collision, and for studying atomic dipolar physics.<br/><br/>The experimental program will have three categories of broader impacts. First, forbidden transitions of rare earth elements are virtually unexplored. These atomic resonances are well suited as potential candidates for next generation frequency standards, with Q-factors nearly four orders of magnitude larger than current neutral atom clock lines, a suppression of black-body radiations shifts by exponents in the fine structure constant, and reduced sensitivity to collision. Moreover, for Standard Model Physics, these transitions have enhanced sensitivities to variations in the fine structure constant. Second, a laser cooled and trapped gas of gadolinium will have many applications: For nuclear physics, astrophysics, and biomedicine, laser cooled Gd will allow for economizing nuclear fuel consumption, ultrasensitive isotope trace analysis of the element for cosmo-chemical studies and biomedical sample testing respectively. Also with respect to nanostructure fabrication, an ultracold gas of Gd can be used for controlled doping or nanoscale milling to create novel magnetic devices. Third, graduate and undergraduate students who will help perform the proposed experiments will be trained. A goal of this project is to attract and retain more students in Atomic Molecular and Optical physics through the involvement of university students in the proposed experiments. This is augmented by the fact that the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a major research institution in the geographical region with an annual enrollment of nearly 18,000 students, and the research project involves the extensive use of lasers that is ideal for capturing a student's imagination. An additional goal is to recruit underrepresented minorities, which represents 25 percent of UAB's student population. Underrepresented minorities represent a large untapped wealth of potential for becoming contributors in the fields of science and engineering. To help address this matter a major plan is to involve minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via existing UAB outreach and REU programs to participate in research projects in the Simien Spectroscopy and Laser Cooling group. Furthermore, special outreach activities will be done with the aim to get K - 12 students interested in science and engineering by performing various physics, chemistry, and material science demonstration at local schools in the region."

Reliable measurements about these previously-unseen events will allow astrophysicists to infer the processes responsible for forming them, and to test general relativity. The main thrust of this project is to perform comparisons of the best available solutions of Einstein's theory (large-scale supercomputer simulations) and current approximations used to estimate the parameters of the binary systems, such as masses, spins, orbital eccentricity, etc. Numerical relativity solutions will be used to remove bias and reduce systematic errors in the estimation of these parameters from data observed by LIGO. Accurate knowledge of these parameters will lead to a greater understanding of the processes that formed these binary systems and the history of their corresponding stellar progenitors. <br/><br/>The major theme of this project is the interpretation of gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, as measured using LIGO data.  The PI's group will help produce these distributions and the associated science. The principal method at present to infer the properties of coalescing black holes relies on approximate solutions of Einstein's equations, whose limitations will bias astrophysical inferences about individual events and populations. Thus, to enable this core activity, this group will directly and indirectly compare LIGO data to numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole coalescence and will perform inference using several models in parallel, including multimodal surrogate models tuned to numerical relativity, to draw the sharpest possible conclusions and assess the systematic error.  Additionally, the group will extend underlying parameter estimation strategy used in this approach.  For example, by using Gaussian process interpolation of the likelihood function to make the inferences more robust and to assess their error. They will also develop a hierarchical strategy for targeting numerical relativity followup simulations and incorporating them into the parameter and systematic error estimates. These techniques will be apply to perform tests of general relativity using multiple modes excited during the merger, particularly as excited coherently during the coalescence of precessing binary black holes."

In some substances waves are easily visible, in some they are easily manipulated, and in some the waves attain a large displacement so that they take on a different character called nonlinearity. Attaining all three of these characteristics at the same time is possible in a substance called a dusty plasma, which is a mixture of highly charged micron-size solid particles immersed in a partially ionized gas consisting of electrons, ions, and neutral molecules.  In this project, large amplitude waves will be observed using video microscopy and manipulated using an experimental instrument on the International Space Station. An undergraduate student will carry out the analysis. The topic has an overlap with other fields of research including nonlinear dynamics as well as other plasma physics areas outside of dusty plasmas.<br/><br/>The data to be analyzed are mainly from the PK-4 instrument, which is a European-Russian apparatus now on the International Space Station. Data returned to Earth are distributed to scientists at other locations including The University of Iowa. A scientific video camera images a cross-section of a cloud of polymer microspheres, which are electrically charged due to their immersion in a weakly ionized plasma. This so-called dust cloud sustains waves such as dust acoustic wave and ionization striations; these waves grow naturally, by an instability, to attain nonlinear amplitudes. The use of data from PK-4 is valuable because under microgravitiy conditions, the dust cloud fills a three-dimensional volume of greater size than is possible in laboratory experiments on Earth. To support this effort the investigators will collaborate with theorists in describing the nonlinear motion.

Neutrinos are ghostlike neutral particles which can escape from dense regions in the Universe;   because they interact so weakly with other forms of matter, they arrive undeflected at Earth and thus tend to point directly back to the distant astrophysical sources that produced them.  The origin of these high-energy neutrinos recently discovered by IceCube is a new mystery in the field, and solving this problem would allow us not only to understand the microphysics and mechanisms of the sources but also to obtain important clues about an old mystery, the origin of cosmic rays.  More general, this discovery allows us to utilize neutrinos as probes of neutrino properties, dark matter, and other forms of fundamental physics.  A major goal of Professor Murase's research is to address these new and old problems through combinations of data coming not only from neutrinos but also from gamma rays, through theoretical calculations of particle production and propagation.  This research is interdisciplinary, including topics in astrophysics and particle physics and connecting theoretical ideas directly to experimental and observational data.  As a result, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.   It will involve and thereby provide training to graduate students involved in this research, and key concepts of particle astrophysics will be disseminated among educators at high schools and community colleges.<br/><br/>More technically, one of the key ingredients in this research is the strategic multi-messenger approach in which predictions for different astroparticles (neutrinos, gamma rays, and cosmic rays) are confronted with data.  With sophisticated calculations including all relevant microphysical processes, the PI will test various models for the astroparticle origins and extract fundamental insights into the source physics of extreme astrophysical objects.  The multi-messenger connection among the measured neutrino, gamma-ray, and cosmic-ray backgrounds will be examined, and source classes of cosmic-ray accelerators that cannot be directly probed by gamma rays will also be studied.  The results of this study should be useful for the design of proposed next-generation neutrino and gamma-ray detectors."

The direct observations of gravitational waves would be one of the most fundamental results in the modern science and the ultimate test of GR. Also gravitational waves will be a radically new tool for exploring fundamental physics and astronomy. They will probe the physics driving the most violent astrophysical events in the universe in ways inaccessible to electromagnetic astronomy. The construction of the U.S. Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) is almost complete. The aLIGO detectors will conduct the first observations in the fall 2015. Within the next few years, aLIGO and its international partner detectors Virgo and Kagra expect to make the first detections of gravitational waves from merging compact binary objects, such as neutron stars and black holes. Gravitational waves produced by the collision of black holes, asymmetric core collapse supernovae, rapidly spinning neutron stars, and even by the Big Bang itself are targets for detection in the years to come. <br/><br/>This award supports high priority searches for gravitational-wave transients from a broad class of astrophysical sources. These searches are capable of detecting gravitational transients in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. They target the most extreme astrophysical events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray-bursts, mergers of neutron stars and black holes, and hold a promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical phenomena. Also, they will extend the most promising advanced LIGO searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not covered by the existing template algorithms. These searches have a potential to establish the existence of intermediate mass binary black holes, look inside the galactic nuclei by detecting binaries with the eccentric orbits, and test the theory of general relativity at high field regime with the intermediate mass ratio binary sources. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization will enable joint observations, with the electromagnetic telescopes advancing the field of the multi-messenger astronomy. Sophisticated signal processing algorithms and source reconstruction methods will be implemented and applied to find the source polarization and waveforms.

In a cellular context, this often involves complicated chemical signaling and chemotaxis strategies. However, the PI has recently discovered that some bacterial species have evolved to take advantage of an active-matter phase separation that generates patterns without the need for chemical signaling.  This project strives to understand this process from a physicist's perspective, but is hindered by a lack of tools to physically probe the mechanical properties and interactions of groups of motile bacteria. The PI's work with the single-celled bacterium Myxococcus xanthus focuses on the molecular details of force generation and the interactions of cells at the start of collective starvation-induced fruiting body formation. In this project, the PI seeks to explain the process of fruiting body development as an active dewetting process, linking new theoretical models with cutting-edge experimental data. The PI's research goals are complemented by an outreach plan that aims to involve more undergraduate students in biological physics and to engage non-scientists through public lectures. The PI's goals over the next few years include (i) expanding the Integrated Science program for first year undergraduates, (ii) starting a summer school aimed at advanced undergraduates, and (iii) putting on a series of public lectures in New York City meant to convey the excitement and innovation of biophysics using examples relevant to everyday life.<br/><br/>The three aims below seek to determine the role of motility and adhesion in driving starvation-based dewetting. The PI's current models of Myxococcus xanthus aggregation rely on particle jamming in 2D. While these incredibly simple models capture some of the observed phenomena, the actual dynamics occur in 3D as the population dewets off the surface without jamming to form round droplets. This more complicated reality requires more sophisticated experimental data.  The laboratory combines expertise in Myxococcus xanthus motility, cutting-edge imaging techniques, force microscopy, and computer vision analyses, making the group uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed research. Aim 1: To understand the forces that cells generate on each other and on a substrate, the PI will measure cell-cell and cell-substrate mechanical interactions using a custom-built optical trapping microscope and mutant strains that lack specific motor proteins and adhesion molecules. Aim 2: To probe the motility of cells inside a fruiting body, the group will track cells in 3D using confocal microscopy to (i) compare the motion over time and between different locations in the aggregate, and (ii) investigate the formation of layered structures and flows within the fruiting body. Aim 3: To probe the macroscopic mechanics involved in fruiting body formation, the group will (i) measure the development of droplet shape and rheology using confocal imaging and atomic force microscopy, and (ii) probe the forces generated on the substrate using traction force microscopy. At each step, data from the three aims will be used to test, and be tested by, the active-dewetting theories being developed by the group's collaborators. This project lies firmly within the goals of the Physics of Living Systems program at the NSF by using physical measurements and analyses to understand the dynamics of living cells across spatial scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plasmas have long been studied in the astrophysical setting since most of the universe is in a plasma state and are important in explaining the live cycles of stars. The heavy use of plasma production methods in the semiconductor industry also demonstrates the economic importance of plasma based production methods in our society. In nearly all situations were plasmas exist, small particles may be embedded in the plasma environment either as a natural component, as a result of unintended growth from chemical reactions, or introduced intentionally. The presence of the dust particle component can significantly change the overall behavior and the properties of the plasma. In some cases, the presence of the dust can have negative effects such as significant yield reductions in processing plasma manufacturing or undesired complications in the design of fusion devices. On the other hand, the presence of the dust can also result in new plasma production methods and provides an accessible, excellent model system to investigate the universal behavior and properties of general complex particle systems. The full potential of the complex plasma research requires that some experiments be performed under reduced gravitational influence, as provided by the ISS.

Working in a close collaboration with the European core team of PK-4 scientists, the US team will study fundamental aspects of complex plasma including the charging and interaction of individual particles, particle transport and the thermal properties of the overall system. These fundamental interactions between the particles in a complex plasma is the basis for understanding its overall behavior. For example, increasing the strength of the interaction relative to the random motion can cause the system to undergo a transition from an irregular, uncorrelated (liquid) state to an ordered, crystalline structure (solid). Using experimental data obtained from the PK-4 experiment, the charging and particle pair interaction will be studied by examining the dynamics of individual particles during pair collisions. Particle transport and heating of particles will be examined using additional experimental data obtained from the PK-4 experiment and results from dedicated ground based experiments. Required software tools to follow the motion of individual particles (particle tracking velocimetry) and the overall particle flow (particle image velocimetry) will be developed. A series of experiments to support the development of potential future microgravity complex plasma experiments will also be performed.  This award to support an undergraduate student is made under a ""NASA/NSF Partnership on Science of Dusty Plasmas: Utilizing the PK-4 Facility on board the International Space Station"" and is complementary to a NASA award made under the joint program."

These include experiments which hope to probe the nature of the mysterious ""dark matter"" which makes up most of the matter in the universe but which is not luminous and thus does not interact strongly with the kinds of more traditional matter out of which stars, planets, and we ourselves are composed.  Along with this are new experimental efforts which aim at probing physics at ever-higher energies in an attempt to test and search for new very weakly interacting states of nature.  The result of this activity has led us to a period in which our knowledge of many aspects of the natural world will be dramatically enlarged.  Professor Weiner's research activities are aimed at making sense of this new data.   He will engage in a broad theoretical study that can capitalize on the wealth of new emerging data, and which will help to chart some of the next experimental directions that might be pursued.  As such, this research is critical for supporting the progress of basic science in the United States.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Weiner will attempt to quantify features of a variety of new models for particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the context of physics related to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), he will explore more thoroughly and at higher precision the properties of Dirac gauginos. These particles appear in versions of supersymmetric theories and are some of the most challenging to probe experimentally. At the present time, a quantitative understanding of the Higgs mass in these theories is still lacking, and in pursuing this topic, Professor Weiner hopes to obtain precise predictions that might be confirmed or excluded at the LHC.    Similarly, a variety of anomalies claimed in connection to dark matter remain unresolved, including a recent claim of excess X-ray emission at 3.5 keV from galaxies and galaxy clusters. While the most natural scenario for explaining this --- namely, a decaying relic particle --- seems highly constrained, explanations arising from collisional excitation of dark matter are still relatively unexplored. As part of this research, Professor Weiner will pursue these ideas more quantitatively, including re-analyzing the original data from which the claims were made in the context of collisional excitations. Furthermore, he will attempt to understand whether any new systems may help clarify the origin of this signal.   Finally, Professor Weiner will endeavor to develop new scenarios that are testable within proposed experiments, but for which current analyses are sub-optimal.   This will likely include extensions of searches for new resonances, or electromagnetic signals of dark matter. In doing so, Professor Weiner aims to leverage our existing investments in experimental physics in order to yield the maximal scientific output."

The Oregon group played an important role in the discovery. It is responsible for the large array of sensors which measure potential underlying terrestrial contributions to the gravitational wave signals, for example from ground motion, ambient magnetic or radio-frequency fields, acoustic noise, etc. This work will continue to be crucial over the next three years of this award, as LIGO expects to detect many gravitational-wave signals, perhaps arising from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. In fact, the other key contribution of the Oregon group is the search for one class of such sources - those associated with gamma-ray bursts. The discovery sparked tremendous public interest, reflecting the public appetite for the exploration of our universe. The publication of the scientific results from this research program has already contributed to advancement of other scientific disciplines, most notably astronomy. Finally, the education of the graduate students and postdoctoral associates working on the project will advance the technical workforce.<br/><br/><br/>The Oregon group has been a key player in developing the readiness of the LIGO detectors and its associated scientific program. Starting with the earliest data taking with initial LIGO, the group has made key contributions in the areas of characterization of detector background noise and in the data analysis techniques involving associated astrophysical signals. Specifically, on the instrument side, they have learned how to characterize the coupling of all known sources of environmental disturbances with gravitational-wave detection, and to monitor these couplings. Here, ""environment"" corresponds to any external influence other than gravitational waves. This allows LIGO to make clear statements about the potential contributions of such disturbances to putative gravitational-wave detections. On the data analysis side, the Oregon group has pioneered the science program which searches for transient gravitational-wave signals associated with astrophysical events which are well localized in time and sky position, and which are potential GW sources. These external ""triggers"" include gamma rays from GRBs, x-ray bursts from magnetars, and neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae."

These goals are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level just in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now.  To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The emphasis here is on the involvement of undergraduate students directly into the research program.  The student will work directly on physics analysis and visit the CERN laboratory.   One of the highlights will be the development by the students of an undergraduate research journal at Manhattan College, a potentially exciting means to develop interest and enthusiasm among the students for scientific research. <br/><br/>The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 TeV data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV.  Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research to be conducted under this award to Prof Konoplich and his group at Manhattan College is aimed to address deep questions about the nature of the Universe from data collected with the ATLAS experiment, one of the major multipurpose detectors at the LHC.  Scientific questions addressed include: is the newly discovered Higgs particle simply the Higgs of the Standard Model or is it part of a larger theoretical picture that includes new particles that could be discovered at the new higher LHC collision energy?  What are the detailed properties of this particle?   Why is the observed mass of the Higgs boson so low, found to be 126 billion electron volts, or roughly 135 times the mass of the proton?  In fact this low mass value is one of the most profound conundrums in all of science and is currently driving much of the scientific discourse in the field of particle physics. These questions are critical to our understanding of the full context of the Standard Model of particle physics and to new physics that lies beyond the Standard Model.   <br/><br/>Technically, Konoplich and his group will be collaborating with colleagues at New York University and others in developing and refining the trigger for the ATLAS experiment, and notably the missing energy trigger, which is important for allowing the experiment to be sensitive to new physics.  Such a development will be tactically important as the energy and the luminosity (the instantaneous collision rate) of the LHC are increased to meet the demands of the ATLAS program of discovery physics."

This project will contribute new understanding to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong force between the quarks and gluons making up the nucleon. The PI will apply theoretical methods to build phenomenological models used to understand experimental data obtained at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) from experiments focused on measurements of nucleon properties. The recent 12 GeV upgrade at JLab will allow scientists to study the properties of QCD with an unprecedented level of precision. The educational component represents an important aspect of this project. The training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students will prepare junior researchers for future careers in industry or academia. The PI's outreach activities will increase public awareness of nuclear-particle physics through popular science presentations, as well as by mentoring and guidance of high school students.<br/><br/>The two research areas of this project are related to the physics of the strong force and are based on phenomenological and theoretical approaches to the problem of quark confinement, broadly defined. The first thrust of the project is focused on understanding of higher twist/order corrections to processes sensitive to quasiprobability distributions, known as Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and will be indispensable for proper analysis of experimental data. The PI and his students will develop a separation technique to disentangle GPDs from data by providing analytical formulas for azimuthal moments of differential cross sections of photon electroproduction cross sections. The second thrust is centered around maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which took on the status of the harmonic oscillator of Yang-Mills theories and is central in attempts to solving QCD at strong coupling. Understanding gauge scattering amplitudes, which possess very similar perturbative expansions in the two theories, is the focus of the currently pursued analytical approach to gauge dynamics. A crucial step in establishing a formalism that allows one to address scattering amplitudes nonperturbatively is their dual description in terms of Wilson loops on null polygonal contours that are amenable to analytical techniques."

The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) program investigates the fundamental nature of the neutrino, that intriguing elementary particle that for a long time was thought to have no mass, doesn't interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe.  The EXO program carries out its study of the neutrino by searching for the existence of a nuclear decay called neutrino-less double beta decay.  Beta decay involves the emission of an electron from the nucleus, and is always accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino.  Neutrino-less double beta decay would be a process in which a nucleus (xenon-136 in this case) transforms by emitting two electrons (and nothing else).  According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same.  Such a direct overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter? <br/><br/>The first experiment of the program, EXO-200, uses 200 kg of liquefied xenon enriched in the 136 isotope as a source and has operated at the underground Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico since 2010. EXO-200 is set to run for another 3 years, and this award will support the PI and his group for up to three years. The accumulated data will allow scientists to probe the existence of neutrino-less double beta decay should this process happen with a characteristic half-life of up four million billion times the current age of the universe. The detector technology used in EXO-200 pioneers the use of selected materials with ultra-low levels of residual radioactivity in order to produce the most radio-quiet environment for the detection of rare events. Some of these cleanliness protocols and requirements are now reaching the electronics and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the large noble liquid detectors, such as the one used in EXO-200, are finding increased applications outside of particle physics, in particular in nuclear reactor fuel cycle and composition monitoring and in medical imaging (e.g. PET scan machines). The EXO-200 project is proving an ideal stage for graduate students to grow into researchers with both data analysis and hardware expertise. The UMass group has a track record of successfully involving a diverse population of undergraduate students in core areas of the project. The newly established Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions provides a stimulating and productive environment for a broad scientific exchange between experimentalists and theorists. <br/><br/>The UMass group plays a central role in fully exploiting the data from the EXO-200 experiment. The chosen xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) technology allows the project to take advantage of the radiation self-shielding properties of high-Z xenon, in a homogeneous layout with excellent event tracking capability and energy resolution. The work includes a comprehensive study of processes with spatial topology, such as bb decay of 136Xe to excited states of 136Ba, 137Xe background, and high energy gamma-rays originating from cosmic muon interactions with detector components. An integral part of the proposal is a laboratory program at UMass to test optical properties of various detector materials and surfaces in liquid xenon and to use the results from these measurements in a ray-tracing optical simulation of EXO-200. Together with focused tests of novel detectors for the Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) scintillation light produced in xenon (silicon photo-multipliers in particular), they are part of investigations under way towards a tonne-scale, next generation experiment (nEXO) for neutrinoless double beta decay."

One of the challenges posed by this problem concerns the study of nuclei that feature a large imbalance between the number of protons and neutrons. These nuclei are generally unstable, leading to radioactivity, and have important societal relevance for industry, medicine and defense applications. In that broader context, this project will provide theoretical support for the science programs at leading experimental facilities, such as the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction on the campus of Michigan State University. In particular, the PI and his students will continue the development of a theoretical approach aimed at providing a consistent description of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions needed to analyze the experimental data at FRIB and other nuclear physics facilities. The PI will mentor graduate students in this research and collaborate with experimental colleagues who will perform related experiments.<br/><br/>This project aims at providing a simultaneous description of positive energy nucleons, the domain of elastic scattering, and bound nucleons, the domain of nuclear structure, using the framework of the propagator method of quantum mechanics. The application of the propagator method will employ the nonlocal implementation of the description of the potentials that allows for the accurate description of ground-state properties using the method of dispersion relations. Accompanying the implementation of the propagator method to describe all relevant experimental data, including elastic scattering cross sections and matter and charge distributions, will be the calculation of these properties using the same framework but starting from the underlying interactions between nucleons as constrained by the symmetries of the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromo Dynamics, and the available data for the properties of two nucleons. Such calculations will be applied with a new scheme that allows the ab initio calculation of properties of heavier nuclei that have not been studied in this way to date. The method will also be applied to calculations of the superfluid properties of neutron stars."

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The LHC has recently begun its second extended data-taking period (Run II), and it is hard to envisage a more exciting time in particle physics. Run II will test whether the recently discovered Higgs boson is fully consistent with our current expectations, or whether it behaves in ways that transcend our best current theories.  Another primary aim of the LHC program is to seek a microscopic theory of Dark Matter, which is currently poorly understood, and to understand whether there exist any interactions of Dark Matter with more traditional kinds of matter. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. All of these analyses require precise theoretical predictions in order to extract useful information from the data, and Professor Williams will carry out detailed analyses along these lines. Specifically, Professor Williams will perform new calculations using recently developed methods which will result in a much smaller theoretical uncertainty than those which have previously been used. The results of his calculations will be released publicly to both experimental and theoretical users and will be utilized in experimental analyses. Professor Williams will also establish an educational outreach program, targeting a minority population (Native Americans) which are one of the most under-represented in the sciences.   By working directly with SuperIntendents from the local Native-American school districts, Professor Williams will, over the lifetime of the award, arrange after-school programs and as well as field trips to the Fermilab National Accelerator laboratory. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Williams will perform cutting-edge calculations at Next-to-Next-to Leading Order accuracy and beyond, and implement these results into a publicly available computer code, MCFM. The primary focus will be key LHC processes such as diboson production and those related to studies of the Higgs boson. Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effects will be included, typically in the form of anomalous couplings, allowing for applications in experimental analyses. Prof Williams will also develop methods for regulation of infrared singularities and apply this techniques to new processes of phenomenological relevance."

Electrons from the JLab accelerator will be scattered from light mass nuclear targets, the scattered electrons will then be detected in instruments located in the experimental halls. By measuring the number of scattered electrons at different positions in the detectors, the PIs will be able to compare the experimental results to theoretical models that predict the internal structure of the proton and neutron. Knowing this structure plays a critical role in understanding the strong force, one of the four principal forces that determine the structure of the universe as we know it.  The supported investigators will play a major, leading role in all aspects of the project, namely the preparation of all experimental apparatuses to be used, the acquisition of the experimental data, the data analysis, and the publication of the results.  The graduate students involved will be exposed to and gain expertise with both hardware and software development. The project is expected to make significant contributions to the advancement of basic nuclear physics science, and to graduate education and training. The project will result in doctoral dissertation topics on related science and instrumentation, which provide the experience needed for careers in education, medical physics, homeland security,  technology, and research at national laboratories.<br/><br/>The supported research will provide fundamental information on the momentum distributions of the quarks inside the proton and neutron, by using a novel method of directly comparing measurements of inelastic electron scattering from helium-3 (3He) and tritium (3H) nuclei.  This method is complementary to that used in past experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which showed the existence of point-like ""partons"" inside the nucleons, by utilizing inelastic electron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium (2H) nuclei.  The new method will eliminate inherent theoretical uncertainties present in the Stanford method.  The results will test long-standing predictions of the Quark Model of the nucleon, and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons.  A secondary goal of the award is the improvement and re-submission of a proposal to be submitted to the JLab Proposal Advisory Committee for a measurement of the elastic charge and magnetic form factors of the 3H nucleus, which will provide critical information for the development of a ""standard model"" describing the structure and dynamics of the simplest, lightest nuclei in nature."

The origin and acceleration mechanism for ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which likely come from extreme astrophysical phenomena outside our galaxy, are currently unknown.  The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers.  Built in Malargue, Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in the Universe.  This award supports the astroparticle group at the Colorado School of Mines in their work on Auger to address systematic uncertainties in the measured energy and composition of cosmic rays.  They will utilize a recently completed upgrade to the laser calibration systems at Auger.  They are also installing and will operate Auger detector tanks on the site of another cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array in Utah, to cross-calibrate the detectors from both observatories.  The work of the Colorado School of Mines group also has broader applications to atmospheric sciences.  They will use the laser calibration system to validate and then share atmospheric aerosol measurements.  They will use the Auger optical detectors to study light emitted in the ionosphere about 90 km above certain thunderstorms.  They plan to host a conference on interdisciplinary science with astroparticle detectors.<br/><br/>The Colorado School of Mines group will focus on improved air shower reconstruction methods and detailed measurements of systematic effects to address the unresolved discrepancies in cosmic ray data.  The Raman LIDAR on the Auger Central Laser Facility will be used as independent atmospheric calibration.  The Auger water Cherenkov Surface Detector tanks installed at the Telescope Array site will be used for a detailed cross-calibration between Auger, which views the southern sky, and Telescope Array, which views the northern sky.  Planned analysis of the Auger data includes developing a new method to reconstruct air showers with the Surface Detectors, and developing a method for anisotropy scans that include energy and angular uncertainties."

This theory however fails to reproduce many unexplained features of our visible universe, which currently prompts several different searches at the energy, intensity, and precision frontiers. By performing very precise measurements of fundamental quantities related to a special case of radioactive decay, one can probe for physics not included in the SM. The funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the construction of an ion trapping apparatus, called NSLtrap, that will hold radioactive nuclei unimpeded in free space, allowing these delicate measurements to be performed. The research done with this instrument will raise the possibility of discovering physics beyond the SM, which could open wide new avenues for theoretical, experimental, and fundamental research. At the same time the development and operation of NSLtrap will train some of America's future scientific workforce in various aspects of research and development, including computation, design, assembly, troubleshooting, data gathering, data analysis and the dissemination of results. The skills acquired by the students will be transferable to careers that can advance the national health, prosperity and security. <br/><br/>The NSLtrap project will aim at testing the Standard Model by providing a more stringent test of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix unitarity that relates the weak interaction and mass eigenstates of the quarks. The largest matrix element, Vud, can be extracted from four types of decay: pion decay, neutron decay, superallowed mixed decay, and superallowed pure Fermi decay transitions. Despite the high precision achieved in the pure Fermi decay studies, there is currently a growing interest in the other transitions to test the accuracy of Vud. The NSLtrap project plan is to expand the ensemble of mirror transitions from which the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis can be tested and Vud extracted by measuring a missing quantity called the Fermi-to-Gamow Teller mixing ratio. As a result, the more precise extraction of Vud from mirror transitions will create further constraints on the Vud matrix element determination from pure Fermi decays, improving its accuracy."

They were long thought to have no mass, don?t interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe.  Neutrinos are commonly observed in beta decay, a radioactive process that involves the emission of an electron (or its antiparticle the positron) from the nucleus, and which is always accompanied by the emission of a neutrino (or its antiparticle the antineutrino) as well.  This research focuses on the search for what is called neutrino-less double beta decay, where an initial nucleus with atomic weight and number (A,Z) is transformed into a nucleus of (A, Z + 2) with the emission of only two electrons and nothing else.  According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same, that is, the neutrino is its own antiparticle.  It is believed that this overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter?<br/>  <br/>The research uses the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments.  The NEMO-3 experiment employed thin foils of particular nuclear isotopes surrounded by detectors that could provide 3D particle tracking of the decay electrons. This unique technique provides several observables for each registered event, offering a powerful means to identify double beta decays and to reject background processes. SuperNEMO will further exploit the NEMO-3 technique. The research group supported by this award will continue its participation in the NEMO-3 data analysis and in the construction of the first SuperNEMO module (""Demonstrator""). Through their activities, the group will educate and train young researchers in building state-of-the-art research instruments and science projects. They will work towards building on the University of Texas at Austin campus an exhibit gallery illustrating the discovery, the underlying physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related subatomic phenomena. <br/><br/>The NEMO-3 analysis has already yielded high precision measurements of double beta half-lives for seven isotopes and set some of the most stringent constraints on the neutrino-less transitions, yielding an upper limit for the effective neutrino mass of (0.3-0.9)eV, where the span reflects uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element. The SuperNEMO aspects include designing and fabrication of the central source foil frame, the light injection and calorimeter monitoring system, and the Bi-207 calibration deployment. For the next three years, a critical period for completing and commissioning the Demonstrator, the group will complete hardware commitments and will participate in analysis of data from the new experiment."

Advanced LIGO's sensitivity is limited by the quantization of light, but can be improved by using an additional non-classical light source. Such light sources are however extremely sensitive to optical losses. This award supports the development of adaptive elements in the beam path to guarantee that all the light coming from the interferometer can be detected. Additionally, environmental disturbances have the potential to mimic the tiny distance fluctuations due to gravitational waves. This award supports monitoring Advanced LIGO's data for such disturbances.  The first direct observation of gravitational waves will be a scientific break-through echoed in the news media, providing an outreach opportunity.

It has long been the subject of wild speculation, unchecked by the usual chain of observation and experiment which characterizes hard science. Recent advances in observational and theoretical cosmology have changed this by providing the first quantum gravitational data ever taken, with a vast potential for increase. The very early universe was expanding so rapidly and with such a high degree of acceleration that the usually tiny fluctuations of gravitational fields in empty space were amplified to a still-small but measurable amount. Equally important, these fluctuations were stretched out in space so far that they became effectively fossilized, and were thereby able to survive down to the current epoch. This project will study how these fluctuations affect gravity itself, and also the other forces and particles. Such studies are part of the great transformation of quantum gravity from science fiction to science fact, and the phenomenon they reveal may help us to better understand the current universe.<br/><br/>Interactions which involve undifferentiated gravitons and/or massless, minimally coupled scalars can give rise to greatly enhanced quantum effects during primordial inflation. This is the source of cosmological perturbations and recent work has turned from these primary effects to secondary effects arising from loop corrections to the power spectra and other quantities. The PI will address these problems over the next three years by continuing work in six areas: Computing and fully renormalizing graviton loop contributions to 1PI 2-point functions in general gauges; defining nonlinear extensions of cosmological observables based on nonlocal functionals of the metric; computing the one and two loop expectation value of an invariant measure of spacetime expansion; studying nonperturbative secular effects using the scattering of matter quanta by inflationary gravitons; investigating nonlocal modified gravity models of inflation, of late time acceleration and of MOND; and exploring phenomenological implications of inflationary perturbations build up from past evolution."

This research will examine fundamental scientific questions aimed at developing compact particle accelerators based on plasma waves (these are waves moving in fully ionized gases) moving near the speed of light. It will also require generating state-of-the-art software that can be used on the nation's largest computers. The students and post-doctoral researchers trained under this grant will be part of the twenty first century work force in computational science and engineering as well as experts in plasma physics and accelerator physics.<br/><br/>This is an award to perform full-scale three-dimensional numerical experiments of high-intensity particle and laser beam-matter interactions to significantly advance the understanding of basic high-energy density science (HEDS) on ultra intense laser and particle beam plasma interactions. This understanding will aid in the quest to make plasma based accelerator stages for use in high energy physics colliders, next generation light sources, medicine, and homeland security.  This work will continue to blend basic research with three-dimensional simulations, including full-scale particle-in-cell modeling of ongoing and planned experiments. High-fidelity full-scale modeling provides the means to extrapolate parameters into regimes that will not be accessible to experiments for years to come. During the past decade, a hierarchy of state-of-the-art PIC codes and data analysis tools for HEDS studies has been developed that not only include the necessary physics but also scale to more than 1,600,000 cores and can run on current many core hardware including GPUs and Intel Phi's. With this set of tools, the UCLA Simulation of Plasma Group is uniquely positioned to continue to make significant progress towards determining the feasibility of building a compact X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) in the next decade, and a future linear collider based on wakefield sections driven by lasers or particle beams."

In 1960s, lasers were invented allowing us to beam energy and information via light beams having its internal constituents almost perfectly ordered and working as a team. Lasers are intrinsically 'cool', made possible by clever tricks invented by atomic scientists and engineers. To date this feat has not been achieved by beams of charged particles such as electrons which are produced in a very hot, restless state by the mechanisms used to extract them from materials. The electrons embedded in most materials have to overcome a tremendous barrier and climb up and beyond an energy hill which they remember and which they vent off literally by being very unruly, restless and jittery upon their release. A typical electron beam produced in today's laboratories is very hot indeed, comparable to the surface of the sun. This research will develop special and precisely patterned structured materials with features a thousand times smaller than the width of human hair (e.g. carbon nanotube- or Graphene-based structures), immersed in a very high electric field allowing the electrons inside the material to 'tunnel through' the barrier hills effortlessly without climbing them, thus making the released electrons colder and ordered, traveling together in a single file so-to-speak, as a beam of electrons that is so 'cold' that it will act like a particle laser beam. Complex theoretical and computational modeling of 'designer' emitters will go hand-in-hand with state-of-the-art fabrication of such delicate and precise structures and their subsequent testing for performance in the laboratory. Once produced, special effort will have to be made to allow the electrons to remain cold while gaining speed and energy as a beam.<br/><br/>The particular research and development will depend on a collaboration of Northern Illinois University (NIU) with major national and international laboratories and their facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Cambridge Graphene Centre (CGC) and US industries. Specially designed samples will be prepared in collaboration with ANL and CGC facilities and will be tested at NIU/FNAL specially designed test facility. The research will open up new areas of scientific investigation and their societal/industrial applications e.g. compact x-ray lasers for 'ultra-fast' science, novel computational possibilities based upon a single quantum of charge and 'spin', three dimensional rapid electron-beam printing of complex unique structures of industrial and medical interest, compact portable sources of light for lithography of novel nano-structures for the electronic chip industry. The activity will inspire inclusive collaboration between scientists, engineers and technologists in research and education and integrate academia, national laboratory and industry for knowledge-based economic wealth creation, integrating the local and national education and outreach programs at NIU inclusive of diversity, minority education and training goals."

How did the Universe begin?   What is it made of?  How have we come to exist?   Where we are going?  What laws govern the answers to these questions?  This area of research is moving very fast, venturing into unprecedented energies in particle collisions, unprecedented sensitivities in observing rare phenomena, and unprecedented accuracies in precision measurements.  To accelerate progress in this area, Professors Gaillard, Hall, Murayama and Rajendran aim to develop novel ideas that will connect deep theoretical concepts to experimentally measurable processes.  Building on their track records, these PI's also propose to discover and study those specific connections which aid in designing future experiments in this area.  By advancing our understanding of these fundamental problems, this research aligns with and supports the mission of the National Science Foundation to promote the progress of basic science in the United States.  Moreover, these kinds of profound questions excite the general public and young minds, and the PI's will continue to be engaged in training young scientists, promoting diversity, and participating in public outreach efforts through lectures, schools, media, and popular science books.  <br/><br/>More technically, these PI's plan to study questions of direct relevance to dark matter, neutrinos, quark flavor, the phenomenology and theory of supersymmetry, observational cosmology, field theory, string theory, and the multiverse.  Professor Murayama will focus on exploiting data from all of these areas in order to constrain possible corresponding theoretical frameworks, while Professor Hall will study new landscapes for physics beyond the Standard Model.   Professor Gaillard will focus on connections between string theory and low-energy observable physics, and Professor Rajendran will investigate new solutions to the hierarchy problem which revolve around the so-called relaxion.

A second step in the laser-matter interaction was discovered where, after the electron is removed in ionization, the laser accelerates the electron and forces it back to ""re-collide"" and excite the original material. These re-collisions are a primary way that lasers transfer energy and create new light and particles. Using laser re-collisions, the principal investigator has observed the emission of x-ray radiation, multiple additional electrons, and recently the shortest pulses of light ever achieved, which can measure reaction dynamics down to the level of an electron or nucleus. The impact of the laser re-collision mechanism now stretches far into the fields of atomic and molecular physics, physical chemistry, and plasma physics. Advances in laser technology, including science planned at 1,000 Trillion Watt High Intensity Laser Facilities worldwide, have pushed laser intensities to the limit where the recollision process breaks down. Broad questions addressed by the research that will promote the progress of science include ""What is the ultimate limit for high energy radiation and particles emitted from laser interactions?"" and, ""With the breakdown of traditional laser-matter rescattering, can we learn to generate high energy radiation and particles efficiently using lasers?""  This grant is co-funded by the Atomic, Molecular & Optical Physics program in the Physics Division and the Chemical Measurements and Imaging (CMI) program in the Chemistry division.<br/> <br/>The research will use high peak power lasers to understand the end of the rescattering mechanism as a function of the laser intensity, laser light color (wavelength), and material species being excited. The experiments are done in ultrahigh vacuum on individual atoms and molecules in a laser focus. The particles and radiation from the laser excited matter are analyzed with high resolution spectrometers specifically designed to handle the extreme energy of the products. The research involves intensive, hands-on training for graduate and undergraduate students in experiment and theory on applied and fundamental topics including: high intensity laser technology, optical system alignment and design, advanced computer programming, and data acquisition and processing. Students from the group have found significant positions across science and technology disciplines from national defense contracting to medical physics to laser material processing industry. The Principle Investigator will be chairing a conference to help students from the populous Mid-Atlantic region share research results. This section meeting is an excellent opportunity for the physics STEM students at the more than thirty universities and colleges within 100 miles of the conference site.

However, there are no existing mechanisms for providing national access to the increasingly technologically and computationally oriented investigations of the brain. The barriers to entry are both financial and structural: not only is technologically intensive neuroscience costly, it requires an investment in physics, engineering and computer science beyond the scope of individual laboratories. This prevents the community's efficient utilization of current technological capabilities and limits the questions and hypotheses that will drive the next generation of innovation. Thus there is a need to counteract the widening gap between the small fraction of laboratories developing and utilizing the most recent technology and the remaining majority of neuroscientists. The successful removal of the gap will require a sophisticated national clearing house to ensure that the correct physics, engineering, and computer science tools are vetted and freely accessible for measurements of brain structure and functions. Successful accomplishment of these goals will require an iterative process whereby specific needs of the neuroscience community will be identified and either paired with the appropriate scientific, technological and computational resources or pipelined for potential future innovation. The model for the operation of this project will be a user facility, housed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and leveraging the existing resources of their science facilities.

While much can still be learned from the mergers of two massive compact objects, it is important to also be listening for other sounds in the symphony of gravitational waves.  Certain types of supernovae should emit gravitational waves along with light as an old and massive star collapses into an ultra-dense neutron star.  Multi-messenger observations of these supernova could help us learn a great deal about how and why these spectacular explosions occur, and about the neutron star that forms as a result.   Multi-messenger observations could also be a key to unlocking the mysterious origin of short, bright flashes of radio emission from space called fast radio bursts.  This award will also cover work in identifying and getting rid of sources of noise picked up by the LIGO interferometers that can interfere with detecting real signals from space.  This work is particularly important as LIGO continues to look for these new types of gravitational wave sources which don't have the characteristic ""chirp"" that occurs when black holes or neutron starts collide.  Annual STEM outreach work serving the Navajo nation north of Embry-Riddle, also supported by this grant, is one way in which LIGO members can share this new and exciting frontier in science with the broader community.<br/><br/>Efforts in multi-messenger astronomy, including searches in coincidence with core-collapse supernovae and radio transients, will enhance LIGO science while providing many opportunities for student involvement.  Core-collapse supernovae are an exciting target for multi-messenger astronomy. The reconstruction of a gravitational wave from a core-collapse supernova would address a number of open questions in astrophysics, including the mechanism of the explosion itself as well as fundamental questions about neutrino interactions and the neutron star equation of state. In the next few years, the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO combined with more sophisticated algorithms for detection and parameter estimation of supernova signals will greatly enhance LIGO's contributions to supernova astrophysics, and future interferometers carry even more promise. Another area of multi-messenger astronomy which LIGO has undertaken is the search for transient gravitational waves in coincidence with astrophysical sources of radio transients of duration on the scale of milliseconds. These could be emitted simultaneously with gravitational waves due to scenarios ranging from neutron star asteroseismology to cosmic string cusps. Gravitational wave astronomy has the potential to shed light on several types of radio emission, possibly including fast radio bursts. The search for gravitational wave bursts is made more difficult by the presence of transient terrestrial background, resulting from a combination of environmental disturbances and behavior of the interferometers themselves. Understanding these environmental disturbances and removing them from interferometric data is critical in conducting sensitive searches for gravitational waves, as it can mean the difference between a statistically significant gravitational wave detection and a sub-threshold event. This grant will support substantial effort in detector characterization, the identification and mitigation of non-astrophysical background in the interferometers and application of vetoes to eliminate them.  This award also facilitates science education and outreach at every level from high school to graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The singly charged hydrogen molecular ion (two protons, bound together by a single electron) is a simple but fundamental example of such an ion. Diatomic molecular ions are important because they are abundantly found in space, and might also briefly exist in other settings, including living organisms. The mechanism binding the two atoms is very similar to a coiled spring, allowing the atoms to move one with respect to the other without going astray. According to the basics of Quantum Mechanics, a diatomic molecular ion is continually vibrating in a range of discrete quantum states at different temperatures, which are defined by integers that state the degree of vibration on a given scale for which the bigger the integer, the stronger the pulsation. The proposed device probes these discrete states and is comparable to a thermometer reading a low temperature for a cold object and high temperature for hot one. It will also provide data that will help to understand how the vibrational states affect their environment during interaction with other particles. Not well understood, these slow interactions, technically called low energy interactions, are known to play important roles in the interstellar medium, in the cold part of nuclear fusion plasmas, and in the processes of DNA strand breaks, etc. Thus, this project will promote the progress of science and may have implications to a broad spectrum of areas of importance to society; at the same time, it will give participating undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in the development of a sophisticated 3-D imaging device at their own institution.<br/><br/>The charge transfer in collisions between hydrogen and diatomic molecular ions touches a variety of disciplines spreading from physical science to life science. First of all, it is of foremost importance in fundamental physics because it involves the smallest atom. It is also one of the dominant reactions in environments such as the cold divertor plasma regions of a fusion tokamak or in interstellar clouds where the main constituents are neutral H, the positive hydrogen ion, and H-molecules. Moreover, understanding of this simplest fundamental system is a key for mastering more complex systems which exist in, e.g., biophysics where radical attacks on biomolecules such as DNA potentially involve charge transfer at very low energy. However, it is often almost impossible to compare laboratory measured cross sections to existing theories and calculations because the vibrational state distribution of the molecules is not known. The proposed 3-D imaging device will ultimately improve previously measured absolute cross section measurements by making them vibrationally resolved, enabling a more detailed comparison between theoretical and experimental results. In this 3-D imaging technique, the molecular ion undergoes a resonant dissociative charge exchange with an alkali atom and releases its vibrational energy in the form of kinetic energy of the two fragments. The detection of the positions of the daughter particles and their flight time differences made possible with the detectors allows the reconstruction of the molecular ion's initial vibrational energy via simple dynamics.  This detection technique is equivalent to taking a time resolved snapshot picture of the molecular ion fragments (thus the name 3-D imaging).  The whole 3-D imaging apparatus is envisioned to be a portable device which could be easily transported to and used at a variety of research facilities."

A variety of astronomical mysteries, from fast radio bursts to intergalactic particle jets, are connected to these strong-field conditions.  And a variety of new observational facilities, from radio to X-ray to gravitational waves, promise new probes of the intense physics near black holes and neutron stars.  These exotic systems hold a perennial fascination with the public and present opportunities for public engagement.

Muons are subatomic particles that are like electrons but are about 200 times more massive.  Past measurements of the muon's magnetic moment, a fundamental property that quantifies how it interacts with magnetic fields, disagree with predictions of the Standard Model.  The experiment will take place at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and use muons moving at nearly the speed of light and confined in a circular storage ring using magnetic fields and electric fields.  Extracting the muon's magnetic moment from the data will require corrections to account for variations in the magnetic fields through which the muons pass.  Methods for these corrections will be developed under this award.  In addition to the training of a graduate student in forefront experimental and data analysis techniques, this project will also connect students from local public high schools interested in the physical sciences with fundamental physics research, via the mentoring of junior- and senior-level students in capstone research projects. <br/><br/>A high-precision comparison of measurements and theoretical calculations of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment constitutes a test of the completeness of the Standard Model.  In the Brookhaven E821 experiment, which completed data taking in 2001, the muon's anomalous magnetic moment was measured to a precision of 0.54 parts-per-million (ppm).  The result from that experiment lies some tantalizing ~3.5 standard deviations from the Standard Model theoretical value.  In the Fermilab E989 experiment, which began data taking in 2017, the precision on the anomalous magnetic moment will be improved by nearly a factor of four to the level of 0.14 ppm, thus presenting the possibility for a definitive claim of evidence for new physics, provided the experimental and theoretical central values do not change significantly.  In the experiment, relativistic ""magic momentum"" muons will be stored and subsequently undergo cyclotron orbits within a 1.45 Tesla superconducting magnetic storage ring, with electric fields employed for confinement.  This award supports work on systematic corrections to the muon's cyclotron and spin precession frequencies, the difference of which is proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment, resulting from muon transport through the small non-uniformities in the magnetic fields inevitably present over the volume of the storage ring and the magnetic fields resulting from the muons' relativistic motion through the electric fields.  Methods for modeling and simulating these systematic effects will be developed by the PI and a graduate student under this award."

Previous research projects by the PI have been discussed in the general media, and  this work also has great potential at being successful for outreach to the general public. <br/><br/>This research project will contribute to a number of challenging and important problems in the area of gravitational physics. The main objective is the development and application of a time-domain computational model for the gravitational wave emission from a large mass-ratio black hole binary system using point-particle perturbation theory. Significant contributions will be made to the development of effective-one-body and other models for gravitational waveform generation, that will positively impact the data analysis of current and future detectors (such as LIGO and future space-borne missions). In addition, the planned work will bring about a much better understanding of the plunge phase radiation and quasi-normal ringing in the context of decaying black hole binary systems. The project will also contribute to the gravitational wave data-analysis effort via the open and public Einstein@Home project. All the research activities in the context of this project will involve students and collaborations with other US and international groups."

This CAREER project examines how diversity can emerge from decision making of individual cells in a multicellular regenerative organism. Freshwater planarians are famous for their regenerative capabilities that are based on a large number of adult pluripotent stem cells (ASCs). These ASCs allow them to reproduce by binary fission, thus creating a clonal population and raising the question of how this species is able to create sufficient diversity to survive on evolutionary time scales. Using tools from statistical physics the PI recently demonstrated that reproduction is largely random, but that reproductive patterns exist whose molecular and physical determinants remain to be investigated. This project aims at testing the hypothesis that population diversity arises from a joint effect of the specifics of planarian reproduction mechanics and epigenetic diversity of ASCs in individual worms. The PI will integrate the research objectives of this proposal into three educational initiatives, which focus on ""learning through research"" and long-term engagement of students: (1) The PI is establishing a partnership with Vista Magnet Middle school that allows 6th graders to work together with her lab on research projects throughout the school year. (2) The PI will continue her efforts toward participation of high school students in research. In particular, she will continue to enable students from Torrey Pines High School to engage in research in her lab throughout the year, which allows them to design and execute their own science projects. (3) The PI will continue her efforts in promoting undergraduate research, in her own group as well as through a new research-centered, quantitative biology laboratory course that she has developed. The course will launch in 2016 and is currently for incoming biology freshmen only. In the context of this proposal, the PI will widen the student population to physics freshmen by adding more physics to the curriculum, and thus create a truly interdisciplinary research-driven laboratory course at the interface of biology and physics in terms of content and student population.<br/><br/>How cellular decision-making causes specific phenotypes in a population has received a lot of attention in the context of single celled organisms, but less is known about how epigenetic inheritance affects population diversity in multicellular organisms. This study will close this knowledge gap using planarians and a unique experimental setup, whereby thousands of individual reproductive events have already been recorded and form the statistical framework for the PI's studies on the population level. The PI's strategy is to (1) test the hypothesis that within individual planarians, ASCs are differentially distributed, in terms of spatial orientation and/or molecular and cellular characteristics (division and death rates, genetic and epigenetic diversity) through quantification of ASC localization, cellular dynamics, and single cell sequencing, (2) investigate the biomechanics of asexual reproduction to understand how resources get distributed among offspring using traction force measurements and time-lapse imaging, and (3) develop a mathematical model based on the cellular and organismal level experimental data to predict population level phenotypic diversity. The model will be tested by comparing its predictions with existing experimental data and the reproductive patterns of specially designed founder individuals in which all cells are known to originate from a single ASC, through RNA-seq and statistical analysis. Together, these approaches will allow the PI to test the hypothesis that spatial epigenetic heterogeneity of stem cells in individuals combined with a stochastic reproduction mechanism determine intraspecies phenotypic differences on the population level, which will be measured in terms of reproductive behaviors. The proposed work will shed new light onto the role of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance for the evolutionary success of asexual multicellular life. On a broader level, stem cell decision-making is currently receiving considerable attention because an understanding of how stem cells switch states stochastically and in response to environmental cues is indispensable for successful stem cell therapies.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences"

In a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations, these therapies lead to dramatic clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients. However, in the majority of AML and subset of lung cancer patients who respond to anti-cancer therapies, therapeutic relapse subsequently ensues, although often after a considerable interval, such that these responses do not lead to long-term cures. In this project the PIs will use theoretical physics and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the process of response to treatment, the basis for persistence of a subset of cells during clinical response, and the mechanisms driving subsequent therapeutic relapse in these two tumor types. This integrative approach will involve genomic, transcriptional, and phenotypic assays of tumors at the various stages of therapeutic response and resistance. As such, this project is expected to lead to a more fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent the emergence of clinical resistance. Although the efforts in this project will focus on lung cancer and AML, the results and approaches described herein will have broader relevance to oncology and are aimed to uncover general principles and models, which are relevant to the spectrum of human cancers. <br/><br/>The integrative approach in this project will lead to major advances in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic evolution of cancer.

In turn, this will guide the development of quantitative models of the evolutionary processes that can then be tested in the laboratory. The interplay between the modeling and data will guide strategies for future data collection and in vitro experiments to functionally test hypotheses that emanate from the modeling studies."

It proved its worth three years ago when scientists discovered the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the known matter in the universe.  In spite of its success, the Standard Model still leaves a number of questions about the fundamental structure of the universe unanswered, giving rise to research exploring Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

This award supports research in a broad but deeply related set of topics in Theoretical Physics, and engagement at each of these frontiers of knowledge serves the national interest by advancing fundamental scientific progress in the United States.    Investigations will include the analysis of high-energy collisions of elementary particles, which probe the fundamental laws upon which the material universe is based, and proposals for new experiments involving elementary particles and atomic nuclei.    These subjects are closely related to the deep mysteries of gravity, space and time, and the possibility that all of the known forces in nature are related, possibly unifying gravity itself with the forces that are seen in electrical phenomena, in radioactivity, and in nuclear physics.   The theoretical methods developed in particle and nuclear physics have also been found to have exciting applications to chemical compounds and metals with unusual properties, like superconductivity.  New theoretical methods, sometimes relying on modern computational capabilities, are making possible reliable predictions for the properties of solids and liquids that were previously thought intractable.   This research, by advancing our knowledge of the laws of nature and by contributing to a better understanding of the physical universe, including practical materials, has significant broader impacts and implications for our world view. Indeed, many of the topics under study by the senior participants are frequently discussed in the media, including the Higgs boson, black holes, the role of neutrinos in the Universe, string theory, the quark-gluon plasma, and quantum entanglement. The research carried out under this award will also serve in the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows at the highest levels. The faculty on this proposal conduct their research with graduate students, and share their experience and expertise with undergraduates and community members, in and beyond the classroom.   Individual members will also continue their own outreach activities, which have included successful traditions in high-school research mentoring and in the organization of science playwriting competitions.       <br/><br/>At the technical level, this award will support research over a wide range of theoretical physics, largely based on quantum field theory and string theory. Recent years have seen a strengthening engagement of theory and experiment in particle physics, with new and exciting data from the Large Hadron Collider, from neutrino observatories and cosmic ray satellites. These new sources of information concerning our universe enable theorists to test long-standing ideas against evolving data, and to develop new theoretical methods to guide experiment.    At the same time, novel applications of quantum field and string theory, such as applications of duality and the conformal bootstrap, have been developed in and beyond particle physics, opening unexpected avenues of research into nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum information, sometimes with applications in pure mathematics. As active participants in these historic developments, the senior personnel of this award will continue and develop their work in high energy collider phenomenology, quantum chromodynamics, in neutrino and astroparticle physics, in applications of gauge-gravity duality, conformal field theory, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, superstrings, and the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories.   This research will also help train a new generation of theorists at the postdoctoral and graduate levels."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has.

The work on active pixel detector technology has application to instrumentation used at synchrotron light sources to study materials and biological systems. This project also has a strong educational component. It provides direct support and training for a number of students. In particular, the testing of prototype detectors for future upgrades would provide a diversity of experiences that are not otherwise available to young scientists working in particle physics.

These phenomena can only be explained if there exist new particles and forces that have so far evaded detection; this collection of hitherto-unknown particles is known as the ""hidden sector"". Professor Shuve's research devises and investigates theories of hidden sectors with the aim of understanding more thoroughly how they can account for the unexplained questions of the Standard Model. Professor Shuve also studies the experimental manifestations of hidden sectors, proposing new empirical tests of hidden-sector particles as well as examining how signals of new particles could be hiding in the data of existing experiments. This research promotes progress in one of the most important aspects of fundamental science, namely the discovery of new physical laws and an improved understanding of the content and structure of the Universe, and thus advances the national interest. This project also has significant broader impacts: undergraduate student researchers are integral to the success of the project, and the involvement and training of students from under-represented groups will be prioritized. This research will lead to the development of tools for particle-physics research that are accessible to undergraduate researchers and made publicly available.  Professor Shuve will also deliver public lectures to broaden awareness and interest in particle physics and will undertake outreach and recruitment activities for prospective first-generation college students and students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, Professor Shuve will perform detailed phenomenological studies of well-motivated, multi-component hidden sectors and will devise new strategies for experimental searches. One focus of the research will be on hidden sectors including right-handed neutrinos, which can account for neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.  Professor Shuve's research will use simulated data and analytic calculations to map out sensitivities of current experiments as well as gaps in coverage. As a specific example, Professor Shuve will lead a signature-driven study of the prospects of discovering new hidden-sector particles at low-energy B-factory colliders and the Large Hadron Collider. This will result in the development and proposal of comprehensive search strategies for long-lived particles that enhance the prospects for experimental discoveries of new particles. Finally, Professor Shuve will study the cosmologically motivated parameter space of hidden sectors, particularly for freeze-in dark matter and leptogenesis in multi-component hidden sectors, and this will establish stronger connections between theoretical motivations of hidden sectors and experimental searches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given huge amounts of data from the LHC and generations of colliders before it, we currently have a fairly robust understanding of the elementary particles and the forces between them that is encapsulated within the so-called Standard Model of particle physics.  However, there is overwhelming evidence that there is new physics beyond the Standard Model. Professor Huang's research aims to substantially extend the discovery potential for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider by using theoretical insights in both particle physics and cosmology.  As such, Professor Huang's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.   This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The proposed research will provide training opportunities for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.  Professor Huang will also aim to increase participation in STEM by making a special effort to involve women, other underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students.<br/><br/>More technically, in this research, three theoretical studies will be addressed to significantly enhance the discovery potential of the Large Hadron Collider.  First, to propose novel searches, theoretical implications of the current LHC data will be interpreted and developed.  Second, to enable indirect searches, this research will study the implications of precision Higgs measurements for new physics.  Third, to leverage LHC for cosmology studies, this research will establish connections between the history of the universe and LHC physics by providing theoretical motivations and calculations of important processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

QuarkNet has created an ongoing national community of researchers that include high school teachers and students as well as physicists. QuarkNet's goals are to maintain and enhance this community, to attract young students to careers in science and technology, to help develop scientific literacy in society, and to develop links between the high school classroom and experiments and techniques used to explore the scientific frontier. <br/><br/>Key features of QuarkNet are the establishment of mentor relationships between teachers and scientists, summer research experiences for teachers, and the development of a scientific and learning community within and among centers. QuarkNet provides opportunities for teachers to become more professional, resulting in the development of programming for peers in the center, in their schools and districts and beyond.  QuarkNet provides a centrally hosted, scalable, parallel cyberlearning environment as a cloud-like service. Held at university and laboratory centers, Masterclasses are institutes for teams of students who become physicists for a day, analyzing real experimental data and discussing results in videoconferences with peers and physicists.  Under this five-year award, QuarkNet will support more than 50 centers participating in a variety of experiments at CERN, Fermilab and in non-accelerator and astrophysics programs.  In this five-year period, the QuarkNet Program will support: (1) the local programs of the long-term QuarkNet centers for ~400 teachers per year who receive stipends; (2) a few teachers with multi-week summer research appointments to work under the guidance of physicists from a university or laboratory near their homes should new centers join the collaboration; (3) 120 teachers who will attend a one-week particle physics Data Camp at Fermilab to be immersed in an intensive experience to learn more particle physics and one that models an investigation approach to inquiry teaching and learning; (4) 32 fellows with continuing training that gives them the knowledge and skills to offer professional development experiences for other teachers; and (5) 100 teachers who will be involved with masterclasses.  Over the five years (2018-2022) this project is expected to reach, in addition to the teachers, more than 150 physicists, and eventually well over 100,000 students.

When the expanding plasma  cooled to a temperature of about two trillion degrees, quarks and gluons condensed into massive bound states called hadrons, including the protons and neutrons which make up the atomic nuclei of the matter around us. This transition generated over 95% of the visible mass in the universe, and it permanently confined quarks and gluons into hadrons. How these phenomena emerge from the strong nuclear force between quarks and gluons is a forefront question in modern science. High-energy collisions of heavy nuclei provide a unique opportunity to recreate, for a short moment, the primordial medium of the Big Bang in the laboratory. It is a formidable challenge to infer the properties of this medium from its decay products observed in large detectors. The PI will develop theoretical tools to diagnose this matter and rigorously interpret the experimental data. The PI will continue to build a thriving graduate research program and foster scientific outreach to regional high school students through the Saturday Morning Physics program. <br/><br/>This project aims at quantifying fundamental transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and how hadron masses emerge in the quark-to-hadron transition. The transport of heavy quarks through the QGP will be evaluated using innovative quantum many-body techniques, where the heavy-quark interactions will be based on first-principles computations of lattice discretized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction. The resulting heavy-quark transport coefficients will be implemented into state-of-the-art simulations of the fireballs formed in heavy-ion collisions. In addition, electromagnetic radiation from these fireballs will be calculated to determine: (a) the temperature of the medium, and (b) how the masses of hadrons emerge as the QGP cools down. Current and future experimental programs at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider have a large emphasis on heavy-quark and electromagnetic observables. The advances achieved through this project will provide the theoretical rigor and accuracy required to convert systematic comparisons to precision data into robust knowledge about the primordial QCD medium."

The program's focus is to understand the gluons, particles exchanged through the strong force interaction, in the nucleus. Understanding the binding of nuclei by their gluon content directly explores the matter around us and within us at the most fundamental level. This program will be carried out in two ways. First, current data from the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory will be analyzed. Second, a laboratory that will test silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors for the next-generation experiment, sPHENIX is being built. The SiPMs are low-cost, low-power usage light collection devices with multiple applications in science and industry. Students will help develop and implement tests for a portion of the 125,000 SiPMs for the sPHENIX detector. This program in strong nuclear physics is the first of its kind in South Dakota. It will provide those in the state and the region access to studying this physics where they have had little opportunity. The project will fund research for undergraduates studying both physics and pre-engineering. The educational benefits for the students will be broad. Students will gain practical skills in computer programming, analysis of large data sets, electrical engineering application, and mechanical engineering design just to name a few. These are transferable skills to many areas of interest to the students, the state, and the nation. Those interested in engineering will benefit from the detector testing and development that will be done on site. Students will participate in weekly collaboration meetings, present at national conferences, and visit collaborating institutions. Such opportunities will build their communication skills, grow their profession network, put them in contact with potential graduate schools, and prepare them for the 21st-century technical jobs.<br/><br/>An outstanding question in strong-force physics is the behavior of gluons in a nucleus at low momentum fraction. This award continues work by the PI and undergraduates to study this issue in two ways. First, the analysis and determination of the azimuthal correlations between pi-0 mesons and/or between pi-0 mesons and charged hadrons in d-Au collisions recorded by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in 2016 is proposed. These correlations will utilize the newest sub-detector of PHENIX, the Muon Piston Calorimeter Extension (MPC-EX), this detector is a silicon-tungsten pre-shower detector with high segmentation that can separate photons from pi-0 decays with energies less than 80 GeV. The MPC + MPC-EX is located at a pseudorapidity between three and four, with the positive pseduorapidity defined as the Au-going direction. The pair rate and pair correlation shapes should yield insights to the number and kinematics of low momentum fraction gluons in the nucleus. Second, the group is transitioning from PHENIX to sPHENIX, a new collaboration building a next-generation heavy ion detector in the PHENIX interaction region, which will take advantage of high-luminosity RHIC running beyond 2020.  Augustana is committed to performing a portion of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) testing. Both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter light collection will be done with approximately 125,000 SiPMs.  Augustana will help design and implement the testing."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of neutrino interactions such as those in this project form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The Oregon State Group is studying how neutrinos and antineutrinos interact with normal matter in the MINERvA experiment at Fermilab, and are engaged in R&D for DUNE, the next generation, long baseline neutrino experiment with endpoints at Fermilab in Illinois which provides the neutrino beam and the Sanford Underground Laboratory in South Dakota which is home for the detectors.   Presently under test are large detector prototypes called ""ProtoDUNEs"", which are massive liquid-Argon based detectors called Time Projection Chambers.  The testing is underway at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, and will guide the development of the massive detectors that will be built for DUNE in the next decade.  Principal investigator Schellman is co-coordinator of the Computing and Software effort for the overall DUNE project.   This includes development and implementation of the experimental computing model and assembling the international scientific and technical team that will be responsible for processing the data from the ProtoDUNE experiments.<br/><br/>This project will create computing infrastructure useful across the fields of Particle and Nuclear Physics and will train young scientists in advanced computing techniques for analyzing petabyte data samples which are valuable across the US economy.

A data logging system will be developed, drift correlations identified, and mitigations will be tested.  Fast plasma instabilities are also observed in high intensity ECR operation and can lead to ~25% or more oscillations in beam current with potential machine damage.  These instabilities will be studied with the FRIB and NSCL sources using higher-charge-state ions, where understanding of the instability will be improved through analytical studies, development of simple parametric models, and synergetic collaboration with other research groups.

Since we can now detect and study gravitational waves, a new window to the universe has been opened. Observations from a variety of other astrophysical sources are anticipated. One particularly promising source is when two neutron stars orbit around each other and merge. As long as the two compact objects are widely separated, post-Newtonian calculations can give highly accurate and astrophysically realistic predictions about the orbits and the gravitational waves emitted. Yet, as the two objects get close, fully non-linear numerical computer simulations of the Einstein equations are required to make predictions about the final part of the inspiral and subsequent merger. This project is aimed at gaining a detailed understanding of such astrophysical scenarios by performing numerical simulations. The plan is to use and improve the highly efficient BAM computer code, which has been developed by the numerical relativity groups at the University of Jena in Germany and the group at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). Such theoretical predictions of the emitted gravitational waves are important to extract the maximum amount of information from observed gravitational wave signals. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>Expecting the detection of more gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries and anticipating the detection of binaries containing neutron stars, the goal is to significantly enhance the theoretical understanding of such systems in terms of physics, in particular with regard to neutron star spins. This project proposes to explore astrophysically realistic compact-object binaries. In particular, addressing several key physics issues such as: (i) How does neutron star spin, mass ratio and eccentricity in binaries affect the evolution of the inspiral, the merger, and final object after merger? (ii) Study the gravitational waves emitted by such binaries: Investigate spectra of the waves and create hybrid waveforms using analytic approximations such as the effective-one-body approach. (iii) How can magnetic fields in neutron star initial data be included in a consistent and realistic way? (iv) How can neutron star evolutions be improved by removing the artificial numerical atmosphere, that is currently used instead of true vacuum between the stars? (v) How can we use hyperboloidal foliations to obtain more accurate gravitational waves? By providing gravitational wave templates, the proposed activities are critical for maximizing the science output of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. Neutrons star mergers and the resulting disk dynamics will shed light on the question whether such mergers are engines for Gamma Ray Bursts, and help determine the currently unknown equation of state at supranuclear densities. This research will be carried out in close collaboration with the relativity group at the University of Jena led by Dr. Bruegmann. Regular visits by faculty, postdocs and students from both institutions are planned. This exchange will have educational benefits for postdocs and students from both FAU and the University of Jena."

The laboratory has been constructed at Bryn Mawr College, one of the few remaining women's liberal-arts colleges in the nation. It centers around a plasma wind-tunnel experiment in which turbulent plasma is generated and launched down a cylindrical column. Measurements of this plasma will be used to better understand the characteristics of plasma turbulence and to compare it to conventional fluid and air turbulence.   The project will also benefit our understanding of plasmas observed in space, such as the solar wind launched by the sun into the solar system, and will help improve prediction of space weather here  on Earth.<br/> <br/>A coaxial plasma gun will be used to generate a stream of magnetized plasma structures called spheromaks down a vacuum chamber, which then evolve via turbulent fluctuations toward relaxation into a Taylor state. High spatial resolution of access ports along the chamber will allow for many simultaneous direct measurements of fluctuating fields, flows, plasma density and temperature. Experimental goals include evaluation and study of the turbulence that is generated as well as establishing this flowing turbulent plasma as an environment in which to study other phenomena - much like the flowing air in a conventional wind-tunnel is used to study aerodynamics. Plans include observations of changes in turbulence in the presence of magnetic dipoles or insulating obstacles, as well as modifications due to injection of energetic particles or waves. Within a controllable laboratory setting, the program seeks to better understand the state of plasma that is observed throughout the solar system - magnetized, turbulent, and fully three-dimensional. Comparisons of this system will be made to data from major spacecraft-based endeavors including the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission in orbit within Earth's magnetosphere, and the Parker Solar Probe, examining the plasma at the origin of the solar wind itself.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the big questions in nuclear science, as identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, is how nuclei are organized (in terms of the forces between neutrons and protons) as the number of neutrons is increased. The goal of this proposal is to understand the evolution of the structure of neutron-rich nuclei, with a focus on isotopes with 28 neutrons, such as the nucleus Ca-48 (that also has 20 protons).  Such nuclei are known to have unusual stability against radioactive decay, but become less stable for isotopes where the proton number is decreased.  The experiments, which involve collisions of protons with selected nuclei, will be done at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). Undergraduate students will participant in the experiments and will gain practical skills in data acquisition, analysis and simulation, and present their work at conferences. <br/><br/>The proposed inverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements probe the interplay between collective and single-particle behavior by disentangling the neutron and proton contributions to collective excitations in exotic nuclei. The mechanism(s) driving the erosion of the N = 28 shell approaching Z = 14 is a topic of great interest. It has been suggested that protons drive the onset of collectivity in this region. The experimental determination of the relative contributions of neutrons and protons to collective excitations will provide important insight. Measurements of isotopes S-44 and Si-42 will complete the empirical picture of the relative contributions of neutrons and protons to the first 2+ excitations in the N=28 isotones below Ca-48 down to Z=14, where the N=28 shell collapses. Measurements of isotopes P-41 and P-43 will clarify the degree of coupling of the odd proton to the collective first 2+ excitations of the Si-40 and Si-42 ""cores"" in these nuclei."

The project is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computer modeling that will lead to better understanding of how animals use the sense of smell to navigate in the real world. Almost universally, from flies to mice to dogs, animals use odors to find critical resources, such as food, shelter, and mates. To date, no engineered device can replicate this function and understanding the code used by the brain will lead to many novel applications. Cracking codes, from neural codes to the Enigma code of WWII, is aided by a deep understanding of the content of messages that are being transmitted and how they will be used by their intended receivers. To crack the olfactory code, the team will focus on how odors move in landscapes, how animals extract spatial and temporal cues from odor landscapes, and how they use movement for enhancing these cues while progressing towards their targets. The proposed work encompasses physical measurement of odor plumes, behavioral measurement of animals' paths through olfactory environments, electrophysiological and optical measurement of neural activity during olfactory navigation, perturbations of the environment via virtual reality and of neuronal hardware via genetics, and multilevel mathematical modeling. The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. The project's results may lead to improved methods for the detection of explosives, new olfactory robots to replace trained animals, and new theoretically-grounded advances in robotic control. The project will inform the development of technologies that interfere with the ability of flying insects (including disease vectors and crop pests) to locate their odor target, thus opening a new door for developing 'green' technologies to solve problems that are of global economic and humanitarian importance.<br/> <br/>This proposal is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computational modeling that will probe how animals use olfaction to navigate in their environment. Specifically, this effort seeks to solve the difficult problem of olfactory navigation through the following aims: (i) Generate and quantify standardized, naturalistic odor environments that can be used to perform empirical and theoretical tests of navigation strategies; (ii) Determine phenomenological algorithms for odor-guided navigation through behavioral experiments in diverse animal species; (iii) Determine how odor cues for navigation are encoded and used in the nervous system by recording neuronal data and simulating putative neural circuits that implement these processes; (iv) Manipulate olfactory environments and neural circuitry, to evaluate model robustness. In contrast to previous attempts to understand olfactory navigation, the present strategy emphasizes mechanisms that are biologically feasible and explores the wide range of temporal and spatial scales in which animals successfully navigate. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering (fluid mechanics, electronic olfaction, and robotics) and biology (neuroscience, ecology and evolution)."

The detection of gravitational waves, either on Earth or in space, is opening a new window on the universe. Such detections will allow new tests of our current theory of gravity when applied to the most extreme systems imaginable. Likely sources of these waves include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars and solar mass objects orbiting and eventually spiraling into very large black holes - one thousand to ten billion times the mass of the Sun. These sources include some of the most surprising objects in the universe. New analysis is being developed to more efficiently describe the spacetime dynamics of systems of compact objects, such as rotating black hole binaries, which evolve through the emission of gravitational waves. The experimental effort leading toward the detection of gravitational waves and, ultimately, the analysis of the source characteristics will directly benefit from accurate theoretical prediction of the orbital trajectories.<br/><br/>To pursue this work, the exploration of gravitational self force effects will continue. A new comparison between numerical and analytical (post-Newtonian) results will be made once second order numerical data becomes available from the self force community. This work is carried out in collaboration with colleagues at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and with a postdoc at UF. Confidence in the regularization required for both self force and post-Newtonian calculations will be increased, as will understanding of the post-Newtonian expansion itself. New gauge invariant quantities, with second and higher order derivatives acting on the metric, will be systematically investigated for perturbations of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and equations which they satisfy will be sought. This latter effort will be carried out in collaboration with a colleague in Southampton University, and with several mathematical colleagues with ties to the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Germany.

Novel numerical tools to be developed as part of this study will have broad applicability to fundamental science questions, national security, energy, and spacecraft engineering.

The state-of-the-art in numerical simulations of high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory plasmas uses fluid models, specifically radiation-hydrodynamic and radiation-magnetohydrodynamic models. Significant deficiencies in these single-fluid models include the inability to capture physics effects included in more advanced high-fidelity multi-fluid models.  The missing physics can notably impact plasma transport, which may have significant anisotropies. Furthermore, the effect of non-thermal particle population on plasma transport may be missed even by most advanced fluid models. The key to matching experimental data has been to include ad hoc tunable parameters in fluid simulations. What is necessary, but has been impractical until recently due to computational limitations, are first-principles high-dimensional kinetic calculations that can address conclusively whether the discrepancies between experiments and hydrodynamic codes could be explained using kinetic physics. The present study will include first-principles kinetic calculations using a novel, continuum-kinetic, high-order accurate, and computationally efficient algorithm to study plasma dynamics and transport in the presence of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in high-energy-density plasmas. This project will address long-standing discrepancies between high-energy-density experiments and simulations and, as a result, could significantly advance our understanding of plasma transport with implications in a number of research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A next generation optical atomic clock would extend the capabilities of these systems and will enable enhanced security for data routing and communications, advanced earth and space time-based navigation, and ever more precise testing of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Ultracold neutral plasmas (UCNPs) are laser produced plasmas that stretch the boundaries of traditional plasma physics.  However, studies of these table-top ultracold systems are promising to greatly improve our understanding of much hotter and denser plasmas thought to occur in many astrophysical systems. The goal of this project is to laser cool, trap and photo-ionize neutral atomic beryllium for its potential use as an optical frequency standard, and to produce a UNCP at a sufficiently low temperature for ionic crystals to form inside the system, virtually freezing the plasma.  This award will also make it possible to attract and retain more underrepresented minority students to physics studies.  The project will involve minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via existing Univ. of Alabama - Birmingham programs to participate in research projects in the Simien Spectroscopy and Laser Cooling group.

Be is an alkaline earth element with a simple internal structure which provides for electric-dipole and intercombination transitions in the optical regions for both neutral atoms and ions.  It is a promising candidate for next generation frequency standards and for laser cooling, trapping, and photo-ionization to produce an ultracold plasma. In particular, the spectroscopic studies will involve measurements of the hyperfine structure of strong electric dipole transitions. The objective of this study is to determine Be hyperfine constants, which define the ordering of the hyperfine peaks and contributions to the energy shifts from the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions. The determination of this spectroscopic property is necessary for implementing laser cooling and trapping of beryllium. In addition, laser cooling and trapping will be used to create a magneto-optical trap as the first step towards performing precision measurements on the intercombination lines.  It will also be used for photoionization studies for generation of a Be based frequency standard and an ultracold neutral plasma that can be efficiently laser cooled into the strongly coupled regime.

Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical law.   The significant broader impacts of this research include the training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists in the nation and the world.  The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the co-PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science to the general public.<br/><br/>More specifically, Mina Aganagic will focus on the interplay of string theory and gauge theories with pure mathematics.  She will study the refined topological string, the refined Chern-Simons theory and M-theory.  Raphael Bousso will work on extracting predictions from the multiverse, and the interconnections of geometry, holography and information, as recently crystallized in the black-hole ""firewall"" conundrum. He will further study the string landscape and the holographic entropy bounds.  Petr Horava will study quantum gravity, especially in the context known as ""Horava-Lifshitz gravity"" and its broad applications, including the puzzles of naturalness in particle phenomenology and cosmology, and implications to condensed-matter physics.  He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and strings.  Yasunori Nomura will work on ideas relevant to the recent and upcoming experiments, such as the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the implications of the multiverse for the TeV-scale physics.  All four co-PIs will seek unexpected new opportunities for transformative interdisciplinary research in all areas related to theoretical particle physics."

These include the tunnel effect (particles penetrating through walls), entanglement and non-locality (long-range spooky actions that seem incompatible with special relativity and causality), and quantum coherence of large objects. This project aims at harnessing quantum-mechanics rules to achieve objectives in the fields of molecular physics, the quantum dynamics of large particles (Rydberg atoms) in trapping structures, and high-precision spectroscopy to measure fundamental constants. Work in these areas furthers progress in fundamental and applied science, is important for continued national progress in technological infrastructure and defense, and is necessary to maintain competitiveness within the international landscape. Through student involvement, the project also contributes to the development of a capable scientific workforce, which is essential for a technology-driven economy.<br/><br/>The research is focused on quantum-dynamical studies of Rydberg atoms. These are atoms that have an electron in a highly excited state, leading to a rich internal electronic structure with many quantum-mechanical states. A quantum description of the atomic center-of-mass motion is added to arrive at a comprehensive quantum-mechanical description that includes both internal and external degrees of freedom, needed to accomplish new goals in both theoretical and experimental research. Methods of high-precision laser spectroscopy are employed to measure optical and sub-Terahertz atomic transitions, allowing one to determine atomic and ionic polarizabilities, as well as the Rydberg constant. This high-precision-measurement component of the work is important because it helps solving a challenge known as the ""proton radius puzzle"", which has recently arisen in advanced fundamental science.  The center-of-mass motion of Rydberg atoms trapped in periodic, laser-generated wells (optical lattices) is manifest in vibrationally resolved lattice modulation spectra, in Bloch oscillations induced by electric-dipole forces acting onto the atoms, and in atom-interferometric effects (such as the Talbot effect). These aspects may lend themselves to future practical measurement and sensing applications. In Rydberg molecules, improved atom localization tools and time-resolved imaging of the Rydberg atoms on sub-atomic length scales enable direct studies of vibrational dynamics. This component is important because it advances the understanding of novel classes of molecules that involve paradigms of molecular binding that were, until recently, unknown. The work is accompanied by studies on optical circularization of Rydberg atoms, the continued development of multi-photon electromagnetically-induced transparency as an all-optical readout of spectroscopic data, and the pursuit of ultra-clean optical-lattice potentials using optical cavities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of Utah to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research using two complementary ground-based observatories.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to study high energy gamma-rays with very sensitive pointed observations.  The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a continuously-operating array with a wide field of view that can observe two-thirds of the high energy gamma-ray sky every day.  The University of Utah group will contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and HAWC and work on analysis and interpretation of the scientific data from both observatories in conjunction with the FERMI satellite gamma-ray observatory.  Through their leadership role in the newly formed Consortium for Dark Sky Studies the group will develop interdisciplinary connections between astronomy, and earth sciences, as well as urban planning and economic development. The group will continue and expand their existing education and outreach activities through research internships designed to bring research opportunities to physics undergraduate students in small liberal arts colleges, through the organization of the yearly SNOWPAC conference series and the meeting of the four-Corners Section of the American Physical Society, and by hosting a conference on dark skies science.   <br/><br/>The University of Utah group will use recently developed diffuse analysis techniques and multi-wavelength analyses to study the properties of galactic binary systems LS I +61 303 and Swift J0243.6+6124 and to resolve the putative detection of galactic microquasar SS433. The group will reprocess both new and archival VERITAS observations with these analysis techniques to search for a new class of highly-extended high energy gamma-ray sources that have been suggested by recent HAWC observations. The researchers will apply the multi-wavelength analyses to joint FERMI-VERITAS-HAWC observations to substantially improve source localization and energy spectrum constraints on point and diffuse sources.  This award supports additional work on understanding the origin of high energy horizontal muons created by extensive air showers that are sensitive to high energy cosmic ray composition and origin. This award also supports first visible band optical imaging of 30 nearby stars using stellar intensity interferometry instrumentation at the VERITAS observatory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principle investigator and team of undergraduate students will investigate the structure of light neutron-rich atomic nuclei that do not exist naturally in nature but must be produced at an accelerator facility.  Understanding these nuclei is important for advancing our understanding of how the protons and the neutrons bind together in nuclear systems that are very near the limits of existence.  As the research program advances to the study of heavier nuclei, results will provide important information for the understanding of explosive astrophysical environments such as supernovae and neutron star mergers.  Much of the research will be conducted at Westmont College, which includes student training in and the use of instrumentation and data analysis techniques, and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, where students participate in state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments.  Major instrumentation used in experiments include the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), both constructed and tested by undergraduate students from several institutions in the MoNA collaboration.  In addition to the science goals, an important goal of this program is to provide transformational research experiences for the participating undergraduate students that can have a positive influence on decisions they make for future study and careers in physics.  <br/><br/>The research supported by this award addresses directly some of the main questions driving the field of nuclear science today.  Properties of ground and excited states of neutron-rich nuclei will be investigated using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), the Large multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), and the Sweeper Magnet and its associated suite of charged particle detectors, all located at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University.  Goals of the program include a conclusive measurement of the 10He ground state resonance energy, precise measurement of the 26O ground state lifetime, analysis of the 2-neutron cascade decay of excited states of 24O, and a systematic study of neutron scattering in the MoNA detector bars at the LANSCE facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This research program will help advance knowledge of nuclear structure far from stability, including better understanding of neutron-rich nuclei near the dripline, neutron halo systems, and exotic forms of nuclear decay including multiple neutron decays and 2-neutron radioactivity."

Specifically, this effort seeks to solve the difficult problem of olfactory navigation through the following aims: (i) Generate and quantify standardized, naturalistic odor environments that can be used to perform empirical and theoretical tests of navigation strategies; (ii) Determine phenomenological algorithms for odor-guided navigation through behavioral experiments in diverse animal species; (iii) Determine how odor cues for navigation are encoded and used in the nervous system by recording neuronal data and simulating putative neural circuits that implement these processes; (iv) Manipulate olfactory environments and neural circuitry, to evaluate model robustness. In contrast to previous attempts to understand olfactory navigation, the present strategy emphasizes mechanisms that are biologically feasible and explores the wide range of temporal and spatial scales in which animals successfully navigate. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering (fluid mechanics, electronic olfaction, and robotics) and biology (neuroscience, ecology and evolution)."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces and the development of concepts that now constitute what we call physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This award supports research that addresses those questions that dominate BSM physics. The research will be carried out at the LHC, which is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions. <br/><br/>The University of Cincinnati group is a collaboration member of LHCb, an experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at the LHC. A goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of the hadrons containing the b and c quarks, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly.<br/>  <br/>This award will allow the University of Cincinnati group to further its study of rare decays of such heavy quark systems. Such decays can provide a unique window into physics at an energy scale well beyond that accessible by explicit production of new particles at colliders. The Cincinnati group's emphasis will be on charm quark physics, in which the group has established expertise.  Any discovery of BSM physics would be a huge step forward in our understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe.  This award will also facilitate the group's participation in the LHCb detector upgrade, that will improve the overall ability of the experiment to fully exploit the LHC data recorded through the next decade.<br/><br/>The Cincinnati group has a strong companion education and outreach program focused on its QuarkNet Center and its conduct of Masterclasses.  Many students who join the research effort are introduced to and engaged in the excitement of the science through these programs and through the group's participation in the University's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The code has already been employed in a number of benchmark calculations to obtain highly accurate atomic data of critical importance for fundamental research and practical applications.  In particular, the code is being used to model the physics and chemistry of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres.  The computer code will be made available to the general public through an open-source license and a designated website.  Undergraduate students will be trained in modern computational methods through developing and testing individual modules of the package.  This includes running the code on massively parallel computing platforms provided through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources supported by the National Science Foundation.  <br/><br/>The B-spline R-matrix (BSR) approach has significant advantages over the well-known suite of R-matrix (close-coupling) codes that were developed over the past four decades and are currently used worldwide.  Specifically, the numerical properties of a B-spline basis yield high computational accuracy and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions.  After having completed the parallelization of the semi-relativistic version, this project will support the development of a parallel implementation of the fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb version.  The BSR collision codes will also be interfaced with a new suite of general atomic structure codes, which use B-spline expansions directly."

Since protein folding from an unstructured molecular chain into the native-state is already complex, the existence of knotted chains immediately raises the questions: how does the chain cross itself to form a knot and how does the knot affect function? The PIs discovered a class of proteins, with leptin as the founding member. This growing class now includes well over 350 protein families, spanning a huge range of fold types and including all secondary structure elements. The goal of the current project is to use a multifaceted approach to investigate how the fundamental mechanisms of knotting/unknotting/threading are initiated and relate to overall protein folding, and how the knotted functional and folding landscapes are related. One of the PIs has been involved in K-12 outreach by performing scientific experiments at local grammar schools which are greater than 50% minority students, by also helping to train children in middle school for the Science Olympiad, hosting High School students as research interns for the summer and by hosting people interested in a career in teaching in primary and secondary schools as research assistants in her laboratory. This effort will allow the PI to convey a true excitement for science to the K-12 population and she is currently in the planning stages of intensifying her K-12 outreach efforts by coordinating visits to local bilingual schools accompanied by successful minority, male and female students from UCSD that will provide role models for the local students.<br/><br/>The simplest backbone, deep-knotted proteins are the 31 trefoil knots such as in the trefoil methyltransferase (MT) families. The PIs showed that an extended time in the denatured state is required for unknotting in these proteins. The PIs will investigate whether specific regions identified as barriers to untying in the MTs also contribute to functional regulation and ligand gating in the native states because of long-range coupling of topologically frustrated regions. The preliminary data are consistent with this hypothesis. Further exploration building upon these foundational studies will allow the PIs to investigate the interplay between the strained topology inherent in a knotted conformation and communication between functional sites. These studies will allow the PIs to describe, for the first time, the physical-chemical variables necessary to overcome the topological barrier for initiating threading as well as the role of the PL on the functional dynamics of a protein<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

During the first two observing runs NSF's Advanced LIGO detectors have already detected at least five binary black hole mergers and one binary neutron star merger.  While these detections have already validated the theory of general relativity at new levels, enabled novel cosmological measurements, and greatly advanced our understanding of compact objects, they have only scratched the surface of what these detectors can achieve.  LIGO and Virgo's next observing campaigns will bring hundreds more observations of compact binary mergers. The goal of this work is to use those detections to answer the questions: 1) How are compact binaries formed? and 2) Are we missing unmodeled physics?  The group conducting this work will include a teacher from a local high school for two consecutive summers, enabling the integration of topics in gravitational wave astronomy into the curriculum.  <br/><br/>Over the next 2-3 years, LIGO's improved sensitivity will increase detection rates from one per month to one per day. This award will support the development and employment of the next generation of source characterization tools to enable new science in the regime of high-event-rate observation, including rapid and automated event follow-up, binary population characterization, and constraints on deviations from predicted signal models. New Bayesian hierarchical modeling tools will be developed and deployed to assess compact binary formation environments.  Alternative signal models will also be developed, which will be sensitive to a range of unmodeled physics (e.g., tidal disruptions of neutron stars, excitation of neutron star resonances, deviations from relativity), that current characterization techniques could miss.  To enable this science an improved analysis infrastructure is necessary, capable of handling much higher event rates.  This award will support the development of a new open-source gravitational wave data analysis library that incorporates the models developed as part of this work, as well as other techniques necessary for characterizing compact binary mergers detected by LIGO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research will build upon the BayesWave algorithm that was developed under two predecessor awards. BayesWave separates gravitational wave burst signals from the pops and crackles of the instrument noise. The BayesWave analysis helped confirm the first detection of gravitational waves, and results from the analysis can be found in the first figure of the discovery paper. The LIGO project presents young researchers and students with a wonderful opportunity to participate in the birth of a new observation science that is poised to make discoveries that will revolutionize astronomy and deliver unique insights into some of the Universe's most exotic phenomena. The MSU research program offers tremendous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The blend of creative activities associated with the development of sophisticated and innovative data analysis techniques, combined with hands on exposure to running existing search pipelines and working with production level computer code, will provide excellent training for the next generation of gravitational wave astronomers. These skills are transferable and highly sought after in other fields. The MSU group has been very active in bringing gravitational wave science to the public through talks, a school lecture program, and the production of a documentary. The group plans to produce new web-based educational resources that illustrate the signal processing techniques used in their research by applying them to related problems in auditory signal analysis.<br/><br/>The supported work will improve and extend the BayesWave algorithm in several ways, including the development of targeted searches for specific signals, providing new functionality in the extraction of physical information about the signal that can aid in the identification of the source, and developing a low-latency capability. The new directed searches will target the post-merger signals from neutron star binaries, burst-trains from high eccentricity systems, and the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of high mass black hole binaries. The physically parameterized models used in these targeted analyses will allow us to produce estimates for quantities such as the masses, spins, and radii of the compact objects. For signals from unknown sources it is important to thoroughly characterize the signal to make connection with possible astrophysical models for the source. To this end, the group will develop new tools to extract information about the time-frequency development of the signal, and related measures such as rise and decay times. A low-latency version of the algorithm will provide a new frontline search capability that will compliment, and give redundancy to, the existing burst search pipelines."

Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) will focus on the detection and characterization of gravitational waves with nanohertz frequencies-frequencies eleven orders of magnitude lower than those probed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).  NANOGrav will use observations of millisecond pulsars (pulsating neutron stars spinning with a period on the order of a millisecond) to search for these low frequency waves. The arrival times of the emissions from these pulsars will stray from their regular pattern if distorted by the passage of a gravitational wave.

Yet the causes and statistical properties of this diversity are far from understood, with the evolutionary processes of mutation, recombination, selection, stochastic fluctuations, and spatial dispersal all playing roles, as well as the ecological interactions between subtypes and changing environments. The complexities of the organisms and environments mean that the eco-evo dynamics takes place in high-dimensional space. The primary goal of this project is to study various aspects of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics focussing on the statistical properties of the diversity, including aspects not previously studied, that these give rise to. This will be done by developing and analyzing simple models, some rough approximations of the actual processes and others abstract caricatures that endeavor to make use of the high-dimensional aspects to extract general features. Laboratory experiments and data from natural microbial communities, some of which the PI has been and will continue to be involved with, will motivate some of the modeling and the predictions will be compared with sequencing and other data. The theory to be developed on the statistical consequences of genetic hitchhiking on selection elsewhere in the genome has the potential to enable better use of human genetic diversity data to infer evolutionary history, and other aspects, of human populations. The educational impacts include development of courses and curricula bringing together biology and the quantitative sciences as well as training of women students and postdocs. <br/><br/>Better theory on the interplay between various sources of diversity and their observable consequences will advance both qualitative and quantitative understanding of short term microbial evolution. The project will focus on identifying statistical properties of genetic diversity that can most effectively distinguish between scenarios for evolutionary history and ecology when the phenotypic differences are subtle enough that they cannot be readily observed. This will enable more effective use of DNA sequencing data and motivate which types of data would be most informative for future studies. Likewise, it will will help motivate which laboratory experiments that combine evolutionary and ecological aspects experiments might shed most light on these complex processes. The modeling and analysis will involve developing some new statistical dynamical and asymptotic methods, as well as exploring the potential of crude caricature models to explore scenarios and develop intuition."

Multi-messenger astronomy promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe by providing dramatically contrasting views of the same objects. To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

The BBN epoch and the proceeding evolution of the stars until they go supernova produce elements up to iron. Most of the elements heavier than iron are thought to be produced by the capture of neutrons on seed nuclei. Possible sites of the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) include matter evaporated from the surface of a hot neutron star formed following a supernova explosion, the merging of two neutron stars (recently observed for the first time), and accretion disks in gamma-ray bursts. Irrespective of the precise details of the elements-formation process, one needs an abundance of neutrons over protons. All environments listed above also contain a very large number of neutrinos, which control the ratio of neutrons to protons. This project will explore the interplay between neutrino properties and the formation of elements using tools from nuclear physics and astrophysics, as well as experimental and observational data.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the description of neutrino transport in the r-process sites by solving the many-body equations describing collective oscillations of neutrinos, which are emergent nonlinear flavor evolution phenomena instigated by neutrino-neutrino interactions in astrophysical environments with sufficiently high neutrino densities.

Protons are collections of quarks bound by the strong nuclear force much as atoms are collections of electrons bound to the nucleus by the electric force. By studying the proton collisions at high energy we learn how these quarks are bound inside the proton. The proton also has an intrinsic property called spin, which can be visualized by thinking of the proton as a sphere spinning on its axis, much like the Earth rotates on its axis. In particular, when high energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) the resulting particles can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks. The goal of this project is search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton, which is identified as an important question by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee. These collisions are observed as photons and electrons in the STAR detector and its component part, called the FMS, which will be maintained as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award will fund the Penn State group to prepare, calibrate and operate the FMS for upcoming RHIC runs and to analyze data recently collected.  The FMS is an electromagnetic calorimeter covering the pseudo-rapidity region from 2.6 to 4.  It detects collision fragments from neutral pions, eta mesons, jets, single photons and electrons.  The upcoming polarized RHIC run will be emphasizing the transverse proton spin dependence for production of electron-positron Drell-Yan pairs. This will allow measurement of the transverse single spin asymmetry, defined as the difference in cross section for proton spin up or down divided by the sum of those cross sections.  The measured asymmetry is sensitive to the strong nuclear forces in a regime where current models of Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics are evolving."

The GW170817 event has inspired a new GW search strategy using simultaneous all-sky optical imaging measurements to provide improved detection confidence as well as source identification/localization. This grant will fund the development and testing of this improved GW search in Advanced LIGO/Virgo (aLIGO/Virgo) operation run 3 (O3), with the potential to substantially increase the number of confirmed GW detections. This will significantly improve the progress of science in the national interest by leveraging the existing investments in gravitational wave and optical observatories to provide an estimated ~25% enhancement in the number of detected systems during O3, and pave the way for future multi-messenger investigations that could potentially quadruple the number of detected sources. The proposed research is at the intersection of the multi-messenger astrophysics, general relativity, digital signal processing and computing, which require young researchers to develop a deep knowledge of modern astrophysical theories, and understanding of gravitational wave instrumentation, and gives them opportunity to get firsthand experience with sophisticated signal/image-processing algorithms, computational methods, manipulation of large data sets and high performance computing.<br/><br/>The novel GW search proposed here is based on combining aLIGO/Virgo sub-threshold triggers with simultaneous optical imaging using the Evryscope technique.  Evryscope images the entire observable night-time sky simultaneously with 2-minute cadence.  Scientists can then select only those optical transient events in the aLIGO/Virgo error region which appear within the same 2-minute window as the GW candidate - reducing the GW-only false alarm probability by factors larger than 20,000. for any night-time GW events. This enables improved detection confidence for marginal GW events and thus enhanced GW detection volume.  GW1708187's optical counterpart could be detected by the current Evryscope out to D ~260 Mpc, and future Evryscope-style systems to distances further than 350 Mpc. Analyses show that a future network of Evryscope-style detectors would enhance the number of GW events detected by a factor of ~2-4 compared to GW-only observations. Such a future network would particularly benefit GW source population studies and cosmological applications of GW events. This approach will also provide coverage of the brightest portion of the optical lightcurve, and arcsecond-level localization for all of these events, which will dramatically improve the EM followup response from the community as a whole, leading to improved astrophysical context for interpreting the implications of the GW event. The proposed work here is to carry out a sub-threshold GW search in aLIGO/Virgo O3, using the Evryscope North and South facilities for simultaneous optical coverage. Based on the properties of GW170817's GW properties, optical counterpart, and analyses presented here, such a search could add an additional ~25% more detections to the number of confirmed BNS mergers in O3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Great strides have been made in recent decades, elucidating the key structure of matter and the forces that govern most of the familiar world. Yet more remains unknown and unexplained, and the modern theory of matter and forces, despite its remarkable successes, is thought to be but an approximation to some broader, deeper theory as yet undiscovered.  The dark matter that holds the universe together is unexplained; the masses of fundamental particles are unexplained; even the existence of matter itself is unexplained. This project will both use and extend the capabilities of the large ""Compact Muon Solenoid"" (CMS) particle detector, which operates at the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN Laboratory in Switzerland, to seek evidence of a larger, more encompassing understanding of the universe and its contents, and in so doing, further the progress of fundamental science.  Much of the research work is done by students, both graduate students and undergraduates, and the education and technical training they receive in this process ensures they can make robust contributions to society.  <br/><br/>Existing and new data produced by the CMS experiment will be studied for possible indications of dark matter production, new heavy bosons, and supersymmetry, as well as for refined measurements of known particles, particularly the top quark, and measurements of as-yet-unobserved processes such as the production of a Higgs boson in conjunction with two top quarks. To extend CMS capabilities, research and development for upgrades to the silicon pixel tracking devices and the trigger will be conducted. Detector upgrades are needed to exploit the full potential of the next accelerator upgrade, known as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.  Detectors and electronics, together with supporting software and firmware, will be prototyped and studied to establish both the design and construction techniques for the upgrade and to solve the myriad technical challenges that are anticipated."

The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. The CNO neutrino flux depends on the abundance of carbon in the core of the Sun. A measurement of the CNO flux would be the first direct measurement of the solar metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) in the core of the Sun. It could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the Sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the Sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector, located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, with a unique sensitivity to solar neutrinos.<br/><br/>The Borexino research program has involved many undergraduate and graduate students. Mentoring and training these younger researchers from Princeton and other schools is a high priority. The group is actively promoting women in science through Princeton Women in Physics.<br/><br/>This award provides funding for the Princeton U. group to continue to improve the sensitivity and to assist in the operation of the Borexino detector. Borexino's sensitivity to solar neutrinos is due primarily to the extremely low background made possible after reducing backgrounds in the liquid scintillator by re-purification. The methods and equipment for purification operations were provided by Princeton, as was the staff that managed the operations. Further reduction of the scintillator background is possible with modest improvements of the purification system and with the additional scintillator purification operations planned here. With these changes, Borexino will be in a good position to make the first measurement of CNO neutrinos. Future data with lower background will also result in improvements of the earlier Borexino measurements of pp, pep, Be-7, and B-8 neutrinos. The future measurement of all solar neutrinos will map out with higher sensitivity the vacuum-to-matter-effect dependence of neutrino oscillations on the neutrino energy, as well as search for non-standard interactions."

In particle physics, the origin of the masses of many of the elementary particles is expected to be explained by new types of particles and interactions found at energies of roughly 100 times the proton mass --- a scale known as the weak scale.  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has attained energies in proton-proton collisions that are high enough to produce such new particles, and has discovered the elusive Higgs boson, confirming this picture.  But serious questions remain about the properties of the Higgs particle itself, and the LHC has yet to shed light on these.  Professors Dimopoulos and Graham will focus on developing complementary experimental methods of probing fundamental physics as well as new theoretical mechanisms to explain the still mysterious properties of the Higgs particle.  Professors Kallosh, Linde, Senatore, and Silverstein will lead diverse efforts to develop the theory of inflation --- our leading candidate for the physics underlying the Big Bang --- in terms of its possible experimental signatures and underlying theoretical structures.   The Stanford group will also develop new models and tests of a diverse array of potential early-Universe phenomena.  Professors Kachru, Shenker, and Susskind are working on issues in quantum gravity.  These include studies of how the mysterious physics of black holes (which seem to destroy particles and information by absorbing them) can be reconciled with quantum mechanics.  They also include attempts to understand new mathematical structures underlying quantum gravity.   Collectively, this work advances the national interest by developing new tools and paradigms in fundamental science.   The broader impacts of this work include the training of numerous junior scientists who then play prominent roles in academia, industry, and finance, as well as the dissemination of material which educates the general public about cutting-edge issues in modern theoretical physics.<br/><br/>More technically, Professors Dimopoulos and Graham are developing ideas to look for new forces at the micron scale (plausibly transmitted by light moduli) and new solutions to the hierarchy problem that involve cosmological history, such as the relaxion mechanism.  Professors Kallosh, Linde, Senatore, and Silverstein are justifying new models of large-field inflation using supergravity and string-theory ideas;  developing new ways of probing non-Gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations coming from inflation;  and developing systematic techniques to extract primordial cosmological data from studies of large-scale structure.  Professor Kachru is exploring connections between structures in number theory (especially the theory of automorphic forms) on the one hand and BPS states, black holes and string vacua on the other.  Professor Shenker is investigating the chaotic properties of dynamics and spectra in quantum field theories, with a focus on those theories that may be relevant in holography.  Finally, Professor Susskind is developing a theory of complexity in holography."

The solar atmosphere is a chaotic stew of such arched magnetoplasma structures that cover broad spatial and temporal scales. The tiny ones are the size of California; the Earth would be barely noticeable inside a big one. The arched magnetoplasma structures efficiently confine plasma until they become unstable and erupt. Some of these eruptions drive extremely intense energetic events that influence systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth. To get insight into the eruption processes, highly reproducible arched magnetoplasma eruptions will be generated and studied in a laboratory experiment at UCLA. In addition, collaborative efforts between plasma and solar physicists will be initiated to enhance the impact of this project in broader areas of physics. This project will also provide educational opportunities to high-school students and train a graduate student towards his/her doctorate.<br/><br/>Contemporary models of solar eruptions attempt to explain initiation and evolution of arched magnetoplasma structures on the Sun. It is difficult to test these models by solely relying on constraints provided by remote observations, especially since key elements (such as magnetic-field and plasma flow in the corona) are not directly measured. In this project, a series of specially designed laboratory plasma experiments will be conducted to simulate the eruption of arched magnetoplasma structures under a variety of scenarios on the Sun. These experiments will provide data with a high spatio-temporal resolution in three dimensions and will have the flexibility of testing a variety of models of solar eruptions, such as dynamic injection of magnetic flux into an arched magnetoplasma and slow-storage of magnetic energy driving a fast eruption. The arched magnetoplasma will evolve in a large background plasma produced by another source. Thousands of identical eruptions will be routinely produced and their evolution will be recorded using movable diagnostic probes and a fast CCD camera. To complement these studies, remote observational results on solar eruptions will be compared with the laboratory results for few selective cases. These research efforts are expected to contribute to a wide range of topics relevant to the Sun such as coronal mass ejections, loss of equilibrium due to force imbalance in an arched flux rope, and excitation of waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere."

Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic ""snow avalanches"", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system.  This project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic field.  This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical modeling work.<br/><br/>To date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies. However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable avalanche events.  The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous ongoing theoretical and computational studies."

However, candidate theoretical models have been developed to make testable predictions about cosmic ray parameters that are observable at Earth.  In order to test these models, precise experimental measurements of multiple elemental spectra of cosmic rays are needed from a single experiment across the full energy range.  Using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO), the IceCube group at Marquette University will provide the cosmic ray community with the first measurement of the elemental spectra from four distinct mass groups from the 'knee' to the 'ankle' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum using six years of IceCube data, new post-LHC simulations, novel methods for event selection, reduced systematic errors, new software algorithms, and new composition-sensitive parameters.  The group will share their research with the broader Milwaukee community to help bridge the racial and socio-economic divide in one of the most highly segregated cities in the United States.  Under this award, they will go out into the community to inspire the diverse local high school student population with fun and interactive ""household physics"" projects and bring diverse high school students back to Marquette to expose them to ""big science"" job opportunities through an IceCube Master Class.  In order to increase awareness among high school students of physics as a strong and viable career path for students from all backgrounds, this work will be framed by an intercultural competency program to train Marquette students to interact and connect with their local community empathetically, increase their own intercultural competency, and to build a culture of compassion within the physics department to sustain the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in physics.<br/><br/>The ICNO is the only detector that can presently perform this highly sought measurement that includes an entire decade in energy where four elemental spectra have never been measured. This will provide a new and coherent picture across the entire transition region from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays.  Further, the Marquette IceCube group will simulate and fully optimize the detector response and array layout for a new prototype scintillator array being partially deployed at the South Pole this season (2018-19) to maximize its effectiveness for the cosmic ray analyses.  This new array is designed to mitigate the problem of snow drift and accumulation that threatens the effectiveness of the current ICNO surface array (IceTop).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We can now use gravitational waves to study the universe. Gravitational waves carry information that can tell us what happens when black holes collide, how massive stars die, how heavy elements form, how gravity works, and how the universe evolved.

In particular, the group's studies concentrate on signals generated by binary systems composed of black holes and/or neutron stars. The new methods accelerate the detection by making efficient use of computer resources available to LIGO and provide estimations of the parameters of the binary such as masses and rates of rotation.

These properties can then be used to understand how massive stars live and die. This award will support research to improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO's compact binary searches and develop next-generation parameter-measurement techniques to extract the physics from observed signals.

Such processes involve cellular decision making, in which individual cells probabilistically make choices determining their fate. One view is that the probabilistic nature of cellular decision-making originates from stochastic noise present in the biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work has been focused on the intrinsic noise of these networks. Yet extrinsic or environmental noise may be much more significant, likely governing the overall dynamics. The goal of this research project is to develop a concise theoretical framework describing the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on the stochastic dynamics of genetic switches responsible for cellular decision-making. The PI hypothesizes that extrinsic noise not only significantly lowers the escape time from a metastable decision state, but can fundamentally change the actual escape mechanism. To elucidate the role of environmental noise on genetic circuits, the project will investigate, numerically and analytically, the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic noise in a series of increasingly complex models of cellular decision processes. Noise-driven switching between states plays a key role in various phenomena including chemical reactions, nanomagnets, Josephson junctions, genetic switches, and protein folding. The methods investigated here can be used to study a range of physical problems. All code developed during the research activities of the project will be made available as open source software. Software protocols will be developed to ensure that all software can be easily used by other research groups. Also, all simulation and experimental datasets produced by the project will be made available for download as an ""Open Science"" policy, to encourage reproduction and extension of results. All of the educational curriculum will also be publicly released for other educators to use and adapt for their own courses.<br/><br/>A sophisticated model for the contribution of extrinsic noise to cellular decision-making will be critical toward developing computational approaches to advanced synthetic biology. To develop artificial genetic programs that are as sophisticated as natural developmental ones will require a concerted effort to understand the basic physical principles by which decision-making networks operate. This project will build underlying knowledge in three specific areas. 1) The fundamental building blocks of decision making networks. 2) The response of networks to external fluctuations. 3) The impact of fluctuations on the evolution of microbial organisms. The educational component of this proposal will improve quantitative training for future genetic designers. The PI teaches a biophysically oriented systems biology undergraduate course, attempting to integrate physics-based modeling with data-driven modeling. The PI also teaches a graduate quantitative biology course for biology students. New regulatory design projects will be incorporated into both courses by creating a computational version of the BioBricks library that students can use to model regulatory designs, using the research software. The PI will also institute an outreach program for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged high-school students to learn about physics, biology, and computers using a programming ""game"" based on the research in the proposal.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The data collected will also help to resolve the discrepancies between theoretical calculations.   The PIs will provide direct training to both undergraduate and graduate students in a wide range of skills and techniques, which will prepare the students for challenging and important careers in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The central questions addressed by the proposed work are: (1) Does the r-process include a region of nuclear shape co-existence at N ~ 74? Measurement of nuclear masses near the r-process path is vital in understanding the systematics of r-process evolution, which is responsible for the production of nearly all nuclei heavier than iron. (2) What is the symmetry term of the nuclear equation-of-state at densities and asymmetries approaching those of neutron stars? This plays a vital role in the understanding of many aspects of neutron stars, such as their sizes, moments of inertia, cooling rates, and the thickness of their inner crusts. (3) What are the fission probabilities of nuclei near the termination of the r-process path? This question is critical in understanding the termination of the astrophysical r-process and constraining any fission cycling therein.

(ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."

There are several different ways in which to try to answer the biggest puzzles this field is currently facing.  By colliding elementary particles at the highest energies to date, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is expected to yield new clues on the interactions of elementary particles at the shortest distances.  By extremely precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the properties of the Universe and the type of matter and energy dominating it at early times can be studied.  Finally, powerful computer simulations can be used to study the properties of the strong interactions.  Pursuing all of these directions, the Cornell Particle Theory group will advance the national interest by promoting the advancement of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law.  In his research, Prof. Csaki will develop new models that can explain the origin of mass (""composite Higgs models"") and can be tested at the LHC.  The research of Prof. Grossman will focus on the heavier versions of the fundamental particles making up matter (the charm and the bottom quarks) as well as on neutrinos, particles that are created in beta decays.  Prof. Perelstein will investigate new methods by which new particles could be discovered at the LHC, as well as new models for the type of matter (the so-called ""dark matter"") that surrounds ordinary visible matter, but interacts very weakly with it.

At the heart of this stunning efficiency is the energy landscape that provides directional ultrafast transfer of energy between the antennae and reaction centers, and directional charge separation within reaction centers. Recently two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has emerged as a powerful method for studying energy transfer and charge separation in photosynthesis. 2DES and other spectroscopic measurements have suggested that key electronic-vibrational dynamics may enhance photosynthetic efficiency. The proposed work will enhance the experimental tools for studying energy transfer and charge separation in natural and artificial systems. The extensive experimental characterization of bacterial photosystems will drive the development of theoretical models of the electronic structure and dynamics of multichromophoric assemblies. The understanding gained from purple bacteria as a model system will inform our understanding of the more complex plant photosystems and may guide the design of artificial light-harvesting materials. The proposed work will provide extensive scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students and will also support a wide range of outreach activities. These include the organization and participation in the APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiPs). These meetings bring together undergraduate women from the across the country, educating them about career opportunities and state-of-the-art research in Physics, thereby strengthening the network of women in Physics in the US. The proposal aims to foster a love of physics among children from diverse age groups and backgrounds through participation in the yearly Physics Olympiad and science exploration days for Girl Scouts troops.<br/><br/>This project aims to push the frontiers of multidimensional spectroscopy to address the following open questions about bacterial photosynthesis: i) Do key protein or cofactor dynamics enhance energy transfer and charge separation in purple bacteria? ii) How do purple bacteria remodel their energy-landscape to regulate energy transfer under high and low light conditions? To address question i) bacterial reaction centers will be studied in unprecedented detail with a palette of electronic and vibrational multidimensional spectroscopies, providing a dynamical picture of the pigments and surrounding protein during charge separation. Moving beyond studies of the isolated components to address question ii) 2DES of whole cells will be used to map the complete energy transfer and charge separation pathways of purple bacteria: from the visible to near-infrared wavelengths with ultrafast time resolution. The rich spectroscopic data to be obtained in the proposed experiments will provide critical feedback to theoretical modeling of energy transfer and charge separation in purple bacteria.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

By colliding protons with protons at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn more about the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The top quark is the most massive elementary particle that has been discovered, with many unique properties, and thus it is a central part of the physics program at the LHC. The Higgs boson is the particle responsible for generating masses for all of the other elementary particles, and the determination of its properties is a high priority. Professor Kidonakis will improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production, Higgs production, and other processes by performing state-of-the-art calculations. As such, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of elementary particles and the search for new physics.  This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Kidonakis will involve students in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  The project will also strengthen physics education and research at Kennesaw State University and the wider region. Professor Kidonakis will also continue to speak at conferences and remain active in outreach activities to the wider community and the public at large.<br/><br/>More technically, the objective of this research project is to develop formalisms that can improve theoretical predictions for cross sections and differential distributions for various processes at the LHC, including top-quark production, Higgs production, and other processes in the Standard Model and in models of new physics. High-order corrections, including collinear and soft-gluon corrections, will be calculated for differential and total cross sections. Resummations will be derived for three-particle final states in various kinematics, thus greatly extending current methods. Theoretical calculations of soft anomalous dimensions will be performed to three-loop accuracy. These calculations are important for precision studies of the top quark, for understanding the Higgs boson and electroweak physics, and for the search for new physics at the LHC. The project will also advance the state-of-the-art in perturbative calculations.  The inclusion of soft and collinear corrections is necessary to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions for LHC physics. Differential distributions, including double-differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity, are very important because they are sensitive to new physics. Resummations for processes with three or more particles in the final state are also needed to improve theoretical predictions, in particular for processes that involve top quarks and Higgs bosons.  The results of the project will therefore be important in making state-of-the-art predictions for various processes, for the interpretation of data from the LHC and the search for new physics, and for understanding the top quark and the Higgs boson.

While this question has been explored in well-mixed populations with great effort and quantitative success, there is a large gap between theory and experiments for natural populations exhibiting spatial structure. This leaves us at a serious loss in understanding the evolutionary response of, e.g., microbial colonies or biofilms, and makes it impossible to predict the pace of drug-resistance evolution. The P.I. has demonstrated in his past research that theory and experiments can be joined effectively to dissect the evolutionary processes induced by spatial structure. This effprt puts this work onto a new level by the use of innovative experimental designs such as engineered microbial systems to track the spontaneous emergence of selectable mutant clones, and theoretical concepts that allow dealing with fluctuations and eco-evolutionary feedbacks exactly. The results of this project will advance our understanding of spatio-temporal aspects of adaptation, and elucidate specifically how populations respond to environmental deterioration, which is key to efforts ranging from the rational design of strategies to conserve species in the face of environmental change to mitigating drug resistance evolution. The data set generated by this experimental research, combined with novel theory and simulations, will allow the community to reassess established paradigms about adaptation of microbial populations. The research will invite novel interdisciplinary activities in the quest to understand, predict and control adaptation of spatially-structured microbial populations. The interdisciplinary research is closely orchestrated with broad educational efforts designed to promote crossing of traditional disciplinary boundaries to achieve new ways of thinking about evolutionary processes, such as drug resistance evolution, that transcend the limitations of the standard mean-field theories of evolution. At the graduate and undergraduate level, the research will be accompanied by a new interdisciplinary course, Statistical Biophysics of Cells and Populations, that the PI offers to students of physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. In addition, the PI has established a firm collaboration with the Lawrence Hall of Science at Berkeley to prepare novel educational resources for high-school students and undergraduates to explore the ubiquity and evolutionary potential of microbial populations and to establish the crucial link between ecology and evolution. These resources, which include a learning module and hands-on activities, will be documented in write-ups and made freely available online through existing NSF-funded cyber-infrastructure platforms.<br/><br/>Demography and evolution are tightly intertwined. The distribution of individuals in space determines the influx of new mutations, the strength of genetic drift and the competition between genotypes. Evolution on the other hand, influences the sizes and densities populations can attain, how individuals migrate and interact with each other and the environment and how they reproduce and die. The feedback between population dynamics and evolution is absent in standard models of evolving well-mixed populations. Yet, it constrains the pace of adaptation, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes and the evolutionary response of spatially-structured populations. The objective of this project is to fill this gap by quantifying the associated eco-evolutionary feedback in microbial populations and its consequences for adaptation. To this end, the P.I. proposes tightly-controlled microbial evolution experiments to quantify how population dynamics alters patterns of molecular evolution, and new population genetics theory that bridges the gap in spatio-temporal scales between laboratory experiments and natural populations. The specific aims are: 1. Determine how the stochastic dynamics of how cells generate population-level patterns of genetic drift and selection and how these patterns control the fate of beneficial mutations. Generalize well-established theories of evolution in well-mixed populations to capture the eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics of the experiments. 2. Determine how spatially-structured populations adapt to environmental challenges (i) via pre-existing mutations and (ii) via the accumulation of new mutations. 3. Establish a new course, a workshop on unintentional biases and undergraduate mentoring to increase diversity in the STEM fields at UC Berkeley.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster and the Systems and Synthetic Biology clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Additionally, this award supports several educational initiatives that enhance the teaching of cosmology at graduate and undergraduate levels through the creation of new courses as well as outreach projects in coordination with the LIGO Science Education Center.<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at developing theoretical methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view, it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes where quantum aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory. From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics. Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and gravitational waves generated in the early universe. Attention will also be paid to find mechanisms to account for some anomalies recently observed in cosmic microwave background. The results of this project are expected to reinforce the bridge between quantum gravity and cosmology, producing benefits for both fields."

Kleban at New York University.<br/><br/>Some contemporary theories of fundamental physics predict the existence of a so-called ""multiverse"" containing many distinct bubble universes. These bubbles collide, and collisions with our own bubble produce ""cosmic wakes"" that travel across our universe, creating specific patterns that are potentially observable with cosmological data from satellite- and ground-based observatories. The detection of such a collision would be a transformative discovery, demonstrating that our observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger whole populated by bubbles containing regions of highly exotic physics. It would confirm a prediction of string theory, provide crucial evidence for the nature of ""dark energy"", and permanently alter our view of the big bang. Professor Kleban will advance a program of research focused on those aspects of string theory and quantum gravity that predict effects --- like bubble collisions --- that can be tested with cosmological observations. Professor Kleban's ongoing research seeks to determine the microphysical origin of cosmic inflation, a period of explosive expansion that took place in the very early universe.  As such, Professor Kleban's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.   Professor Kleban's work will also continue to have broader impact in the form of public lectures and interviews, and in inspiring undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU. On another front, Prof. Kleban will also train and assist in the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher who will participate in this project.<br/><br/>More technically, Prof. Kleban will attempt to realize a model known as ""unwinding inflation"" in a consistent, stabilized string theory compactification.  This model has a number of notable advantages that might make it a plausible explanation for inflation, particularly the fact that it begins spontaneously from a generic meta-stable de Sitter phase in the string landscape.  He will also continue his work on inflationary signatures of bubble collisions, tunneling, and other initial-state effects, as well as dynamical features produced during inflation that might indicate its microphysical origin.  Lastly, he will continue to study string theory in strongly time-dependent settings, such as cosmology and relativistic brane scattering."

However, the nature and origin of DM remains one of the most profound problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology.  A whole array of direct- and indirect-detection experiments, combined with the successful running of the Large Hadron Collider, will help us discover the DM and establish its particle-physics origin.  The complementary information provided by these experiments will also play a crucial role in explaining the DM content of the universe.  The research funded by this award will study theoretical models and observational signatures of DM production mechanisms beyond the dominant paradigm based on the notion that the DM consists of weakly interacting massless particles.  Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical law.      The research funded by this award will also have significant broader impacts.  Professor Allahverdi will involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field.  The PI will additionally bring his results to a broader audience through job shadowing and mentorship of high-school students, as well as by visiting schools and giving public lectures.<br/> <br/>More technically, the research supported by this award focuses on scenarios of non-thermal DM production having a two-fold goal.  First, the PI wishes to study novel theoretical models and distinct experimental signals of non-thermal DM.  In several extensions of the Standard Model, the DM is produced in a non-thermal fashion.  Second, the PI wishes to explore interesting connections between primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-thermal DM that can arise in a universe with non-standard thermal history.  To achieve these objectives, Professor Allahverdi will build new particle-physics models of non-thermal DM, test their observational signals via DM indirect-detection experiments and structure-formation data, and examine consequences of possible connections between PBHs and DM in these models.  These investigations will help us determine the theoretical origin of DM and its embedding within a fundamental theory.  They will also enable us to use DM as a window to the thermal history of the universe when it was only a tiny fraction of a second old.  This is far earlier than that provided by the current observational probes involving the cosmic microwave background or Big-Bang nucleosynthesis."

Consequently the detectors themselves must be radiation tolerant. A worldwide program is underway to develop radiation tolerant technologies for detection of particles at planned future colliders. These colliders, for example the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) (scheduled to begin operation around 2023), will typically apply higher energy and luminosity to explore completely new discovery realms, with correspondingly greater radiation penalty.

The automated device that will be built through this award will greatly reduce the time needed to do the irradiation and thus enable many more tests/experiments at facilities such as the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) in New Mexico.  Radiation exposure studies are a necessary step in the development of sensors and electronics applied to a broad scope of modern needs including aerospace and defense applications.

This goal will be achieved through electron scattering experiments to be performed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). These experiments will measure the spatial distributions of electric charge and current in both the proton and the neutron; this information is encoded in the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. A fundamental understanding of the nucleon form factors in terms of QCD is one of the outstanding challenges in nuclear physics today.

One important step towards addressing this challenge is to characterize the internal structure of the nucleon via form factor measurements.

The SBS program comprises high impact experiments studying the electromagnetic form factors of both the proton and neutron at a much higher momentum transfer than previously studied. The new data from the SBS experiments will allow a partonic flavor decomposition of the form factors to be performed, which in turn can be tested using calculations provided by the CJ effort.

Multi-messenger astronomy promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe by providing dramatically contrasting views of the same objects. To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

The project addresses fundamental questions in gravitational and nuclear physics: (I) Is General Relativity correct in the strong and dynamical field regime of gravity? (II) What is the nature of supranuclear matter? The proposed research establishes a new framework for probing the extreme nature of gravity and dense matter physics with gravitational wave observations. Such a research program will significantly enhance the ability of extracting the scientific return from current and future observations. Understanding the extreme nature of gravity and dense matter may bring implications also to other fields, including particle and high energy physics and cosmology. The outreach part of the project tries to develop public's interests, curiosity and enthusiasms in science by connecting them to the frontier scientific research on gravitational waves through multiple outreach events. Such activities allow the PI and collaborators to directly reach, inspire and excite, in particular, the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research objectives are (i) to maximize the ability of extracting gravitational physics information from the currently-available gravitational wave data, (ii) to consider new sources of gravitational waves as probes of strong and dynamical field gravity and (iii) to reveal how accurately one can determine the equation of state for supranuclear matter with current and future gravitational wave observations. PI Yagi will take the following methodology to achieve the above research goals. On the gravitational physics front, the PI's team will focus on studying corrections away from General Relativity entering in the amplitude of gravitational waveforms that have mostly been neglected. The team will also consider astrophysical stochastic backgrounds as new sources of gravitational waves to probe strong and dynamical field gravity. On the nuclear physics front, PI Yagi and collaborators will carry out a detailed Bayesian parameter estimation study by including spin precession and adopting universal relations for neutron stars that do not depend strongly on the unknown equation of state. They will also study universal relations among tidal parameters and nuclear physics parameters so that one can directly probe the latter with gravitational wave observations. The educational part of the proposal aims at conveying the historical discovery of gravitational waves and the beauty of General Relativity to the public. PI Yagi and collaborators will achieve this goal by displaying a planetarium show created by collaborator Yunes at Montana State University at several different planetarium domes in Virginia, including those at James Madison University and Radford University.

Electrons can induce specific chemical reactions which are relevant to dielectric aging, surface engineering, radiation damage, cancer therapy, and atmospheric physics. Collisions involving positrons and positron-containing atoms play an important role in ongoing investigations of fundamental properties of matter and antimatter. Answers to the big question of why matter dominates over antimatter in our universe require studies of the simplest antimatter atom, antihydrogen. Creation of antihydrogen atoms can be accomplished by colliding antiprotons with positronium atoms, each containing an electron and a positron. These processes are currently investigated at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland, which provides the powerful source of antiprotons. This project will contribute to such efforts by providing a foundation of basic collision theory, and by extending existing collision theory into uncharted domains. The awarded research will have impact in the areas of chemical control, radiobiology, atmospheric science, and in studies of fundamental properties of antimatter. The research involves interdisciplinary efforts and international collaborations with scientists from other fields of physics and chemistry. Supervision of graduate students promotes their training in diverse areas of physics.<br/><br/>The project involves studies of electron-molecule and positronium-molecule collision processes. These studies are supplemented by theoretical investigation of more fundamental processes of positronium collisions with protons and antiprotons. The research focus is on development of the theory of the dissociative electron attachment to polyatomic molecules, the process resulting in bond breaking in molecules and dissociating them into neutral and negatively charged fragments. Effective potentials are used for calculation of positronium collisions with diatomic molecules with emphasis on the resonant scattering.

One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to study the properties and characteristics of this newly discovered particle as a laboratory to see if it behaves as the SM predicts or if there are deviations suggesting evidence for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples.

The GW170817 event has inspired a new GW search strategy using simultaneous all-sky optical imaging measurements to provide improved detection confidence as well as source identification/localization. This grant will fund the development and testing of this improved GW search in Advanced LIGO/Virgo (aLIGO/Virgo) operation run 3 (O3), with the potential to substantially increase the number of confirmed GW detections. This will significantly improve the progress of science in the national interest by leveraging the existing investments in gravitational wave and optical observatories to provide an estimated ~25% enhancement in the number of detected systems during O3, and pave the way for future multi-messenger investigations that could potentially quadruple the number of detected sources. The proposed research is at the intersection of the multi-messenger astrophysics, general relativity, digital signal processing and computing, which require young researchers to develop a deep knowledge of modern astrophysical theories, and understanding of gravitational wave instrumentation, and gives them opportunity to get firsthand experience with sophisticated signal/image-processing algorithms, computational methods, manipulation of large data sets and high performance computing.<br/><br/>The novel GW search proposed here is based on combining aLIGO/Virgo sub-threshold triggers with simultaneous optical imaging using the Evryscope technique.  Evryscope images the entire observable night-time sky simultaneously with 2-minute cadence.  Scientists can then select only those optical transient events in the aLIGO/Virgo error region which appear within the same 2-minute window as the GW candidate - reducing the GW-only false alarm probability by factors larger than 20,000. for any night-time GW events. This enables improved detection confidence for marginal GW events and thus enhanced GW detection volume.  GW1708187's optical counterpart could be detected by the current Evryscope out to D ~260 Mpc, and future Evryscope-style systems to distances further than 350 Mpc. Analyses show that a future network of Evryscope-style detectors would enhance the number of GW events detected by a factor of ~2-4 compared to GW-only observations. Such a future network would particularly benefit GW source population studies and cosmological applications of GW events. This approach will also provide coverage of the brightest portion of the optical lightcurve, and arcsecond-level localization for all of these events, which will dramatically improve the EM followup response from the community as a whole, leading to improved astrophysical context for interpreting the implications of the GW event. The proposed work here is to carry out a sub-threshold GW search in aLIGO/Virgo O3, using the Evryscope North and South facilities for simultaneous optical coverage. Based on the properties of GW170817's GW properties, optical counterpart, and analyses presented here, such a search could add an additional ~25% more detections to the number of confirmed BNS mergers in O3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. An important area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to study rare decays of kaons, as a probe of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  Kaons are the lightest particles containing a strange quark. The kaon physics program at the CERN Laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland includes measurements of the ultra-rare decays of kaons, including precision investigations of the weak interaction, and searches for violations of and for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model.  This project will focus on the study of ultra-rare decays.<br/><br/>The George Mason University group is a key participant and the sole U.S. group in the CERN NA62 experiment, whose primary objective is to measure the rate of an ultra-rare decay of charged kaons, through the flavor-changing neutral current to a charged pion and a pair of neutrinos.  The rate of this transition is predicted in the Standard Model, while alternative models predict very different rates.  Hence this challenging measurement has the potential to provide important evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

The principal goal of this research is to discover evidence for new fundamental physical processes and particles.  This is done by comparing precise predictions of theories of currently known physical processes and particles with the results of precise experiments.  The methods that Professor deTar and his collaborators develop and their calculational products and software are used widely around the world for related  studies.  In addition to maintaining US excellence in fundamental science, this research supports US preeminence in computing technology and manpower.  Students and postdoctoral research associates working on these projects receive highly marketable training in high-performance computing and state-of-the-art statistical analysis of large data sets.  <br/><br/>In more technical terms, Professor deTar and his collaborators are carrying out a broad research program in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of interacting quarks and gluons.  They do this using numerical calculations on high-performance computers.  These numerical calculations are done on a grid of space-time points (lattice).  During the last several years they have generated a library of gluon-configuration ensembles with up, down, strange and charm quarks, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action.  These gluon configurations can be thought of as  ""snapshots"" of the QCD vacuum, and are the basis for a wide variety of calculations of physical interest.  These ensembles have significantly smaller lattice artifacts than those they previously generated with the improved staggered (asqtad) action.  Moreover, these calculations have reached an important milestone by generating, for the first time, configurations in which the four lightest quarks are all included with masses at or very close to their physical values.  For these reasons the HISQ ensembles are enabling major improvements in the calculation of a variety of physical quantities of importance in high-energy physics, including the strong-interaction contributions to the magnetic moment of the muon.  Results of these Standard-Model predictions will be checked against experimental measurements currently underway at Fermilab.  Professor deTar and his collaborators are also extending their studies of the leptonic decay constants of the pi, K, D, Ds,  B and Bs mesons, the semileptonic form factors of D and B mesons, and the mixing of neutral B and Bs mesons with their antiparticles.  These calculations will enable them to significantly improve the precision of their determinations of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements V_us, V_ub, V_cd, V_cs, and V_cb, as well as the masses of the up, down, strange, charm and bottom quarks.  The calculations of the CKM matrix elements will provide more stringent tests of our current theories of the fundamental interactions of physics, while the determination of related hadronic weak-interaction matrix elements can help constrain theories that have been proposed to study physics that goes beyond our current theories."

The main hypothesis is that modulation and elimination of feedback leads to the stabilization of normal sinus rhythm, and therefore prevents abnormal rhythm formation in the heart. The revised concept of electrical restitution will be more accurate in predicting the transition to arrhythmias in the heart. Specifically, the PI proposes: (1) to develop a novel restitution concept by including a physiological HRV, and to test predictions of this new concept in isolated cardiac myocytes; (2) to validate predictions of the novel restitution concept in cardiac tissue using both numerical simulations of physiological ionic models and whole heart optical mapping experiments; and (3) to demonstrate the beneficial effect of feedback modulation on abnormal rhythm development using an in-vivo rat model. The proposed program will train graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary environment, and will expose students to nonlinear ways of thinking. The proposed activities will help students gain the ability to use nonlinear analyses to understand complexities in engineering and biological systems. The proposed research is designed to allow maximum use of combined numerical simulations and experimental approaches. Different levels of numerical simulations and experimental techniques will help train students in various areas, and encourage them to work as a team to accomplish the general objectives of the grant. As a part of educational program, the PI will develop a new course suitable for graduate and undergraduate students from the College of Science and Engineering to enhance their exposure to nonlinear dynamics. This course will describe the dynamics of the heart based on a multi-level approach, from single ionic current to isolated cardiac myocytes to the whole heart. The results of the research program will be used to promote ?hand-on? learning through demonstration and laboratory experiments. With the help of graduate and undergraduate students, the PI will design a Summer Lab course on cardiac electrophysiology to help students gasp several techniques, including optical imaging, data acquisition, nonlinear signal analysis, and feedback control. During next several years, the PI will organize an educational summer camp on cardiac dynamics adapted for high-school students, in which both lectures and lab course will be adapted for their needs."

The main hypothesis is that adherent cells resist mechanical failure in two ways: by switching the conformations of their adhesive proteins and by clustering them together at sites of cell-cell contact. The PI will test this hypothesis on multiple length scales, ranging from single molecules to live cells, by using an integrated approach that uniquely and innovatively combines predictive computer simulations and quantitative single molecule experiments. This research will be integrated with an education plan to attract undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minorities from local community colleges, into physics by motivating them with hands-on research experiences, by offering one-on-one mentorship, and by developing new inquiry-based courses that integrate research into teaching. The goals of the educational plan are to (i) Provide hands-on research experience to underrepresented minority students from local community colleges by partnering with the Iowa Illinois Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education (IINSPIRE) (ii) Collaborate with the Iowa State University Freshman Honors Program (FHP) to provide research experiences for undergraduates early in their academic careers. (iii) Collaborate with colleges serving underrepresented minorities to improve their science curricula (iv) Increase knowledge of biological physics by developing new courses that integrate research and teaching. A critical barrier to the success of underrepresented minorities majoring in physics is the lack of direct exposure to research and the absence of personalized mentoring. The partnership with IINSPIRE and with colleges serving underrepresented minorities will eliminate these barriers. With FHP, the PI will identify undergraduate talent early and nurture their scientific potential and guide them into research-strong careers. New courses are being developed by the investigators that will directly encourage and foster student interest in biological physics research. <br/><br/>Cadherins are prototypical adhesion proteins that mediate the integrity of all soft tissue. Their principal role is to bind cells together to survive mechanical perturbations. However, the mechanisms by which cadherins resist mechanical stress, are not understood. Based upon extensive preliminary experimental and simulation data, the PI hypothesizes that mechanical force triggers a feedback loop to establish adhesive equilibrium. Two key mechanisms are involved in this feedback: (i) force-induced switching between alternate cadherin conformations and (ii) force-induced clustering of cadherin at cell-cell contacts. To test this hypothesis, the PI will measure how force induces shuttling of cadherins between alternate conformations, both in vitro and on live cells, using single molecule force measurements. The PI will also measure force-induced cadherin clustering, on the millisecond timescale, using single molecule force microscope-fluorescence microscope, an innovation that this group recently developed. Specific molecular interpretations of experiments will be provided by a variety of multi-scale molecular simulations that will be carried out in parallel with the experiments. The project is organized around two specific aims: Aim 1: How does cadherin conformational shuttling establish mechanical feedback? Aim 2: How does mechanical force promote cadherin clustering? This project will provide a deep, physics-based understanding of the force-induced response of cadherin within the context of fully functional cell-cell adhesion junctions and provide molecular mechanisms for these processes. The approaches developed in this project will have transformative applications in numerous areas of mechano-biology, including studies of stem cell differentiation and tissue remodeling.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such measurements lie at the heart of this project. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using a test beam and at the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 10 kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. The MicroBooNE will have an active volume of 80 tons of liquid argon and 8256 wires spread over three instrumented wireplanes making up the Time Projection Chamber. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. Another aspect of the work in this award is the development of a large LArTPC detector at CERN called ProtoDUNE. This award will provide one post-doctoral fellow to work on the installation and commissioning of the Proto-DUNE detector. The lessons learned here will inform the future DUNE detector design.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will involve graduate students and undergraduates supported by this project receiving first-hand experience with High Energy Physics detector development, while also having access to MicroBooNE data that the graduate students will use for their dissertation analyses. The Syracuse group will continue with several outreach efforts as part of this proposal. The group maintains an outreach webpage that includes an ""Ask-a-A-Physicist"" questionnaire form as well as an active QuarkNet program."

Understanding how chromatin changes in time presents a fundamental question and is currently a frontier in both polymer physics as well as cell biology. To a physicist, chromatin is an exquisite example of a confined polymer that is subject to the basic laws of physics. To a biologist, chromatin controls gene expression, and physically packages DNA in a way that facilitates its replication and segregation. This project will lead to a mechanistic picture of active chromatin dynamics in live cells by integrating quantitative experimental approaches and theory from different areas of physics. As a part of this research program, the PI will develop a science outreach component targeting high school girls from underrepresented groups. In addition, this research program will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be trained in advanced optical microscopy techniques, small angle X-ray scattering, image processing, data analysis and polymer physics and statistical mechanics approaches pertinent to active systems far from equilibrium.<br/><br/>The sequence of the human genome has been known for two decades, but its dynamic organization in three dimensions remains elusive. Methods like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromosome conformation capture (HiC) provided insights into how the chromatin is organized inside the cell nucleus. Methods like chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-Seq) helped us to map specific molecular players to the specific genomic loci within the context of specifics functions, usually transcriptional regulation. While FISH and HiC methods give us a 3D picture of the genome organization, it is a static picture, i.e. a snapshot of the human genome in a given time; they do not inform on the dynamic reorganization of the genome inside the nucleus. Similarly, Chip-Seq provides us with a snapshot of detailed 1D localization information of proteins of interest. The missing link in our current understanding is the connection between the 1D genomic information and the 3D topology of the cell nucleus in real time. The overall goal of this research program is to generate this missing link, i.e. to develop a real-time imaging of spatiotemporal dynamics of the human genome and understand the underlying physical laws. This research focuses on elucidating physics underlying nonequilibrium soft matter. Specifically, it presents development of an experimental and intellectual framework for understanding the dynamic behavior of chromatin in live cells. Chromatin presents an active polymer living in a confinement of the cell nucleus that is very different from the soft matter traditionally studied. It undergoes dynamic rearrangements, dissipates energy and exhibits self-organization far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Understanding of the mechanism/s beyond the active dynamics and elucidating the physical laws that such dynamics follows, will teach us new physics and its role in nuclear physiology.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The project investigates three systems: the pi meson, the muon (a more massive ""cousin"" of the electron), and the neutron, focusing on the intrinsic low-energy properties of each of them.  Those properties are sensitive to some of the basic components of the Standard Model, which describes the number and basic characteristics of the known elementary particles.   Determining these properties thus has the potential to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model.   The project aims to advance basic science in nuclear and elementary particle physics, contribute to building the nation's STEM talent by educating members of the new generation of the STEM workforce, while keeping in focus its diversity and tapping the broadest available talent pool, and, finally, to develop new tools in fundamental research with possible broader applications.<br/><br/>The proposed research continues an ongoing program of study of the electroweak and strong interactions at low energies.  The immediate goals of the project are: (a) conclusion of the data analysis for the PEN experiment, a precise measurement of the electronic and radiative electronic rare decays of the pion (pi-e2 and pi-e2g), completed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and (b) assembly and commissioning of the apparatus for Nab, a program of precise measurements of the neutron beta decay parameters at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  The UVa group plays a leading role in both projects.  As the work on PEN nears completion, focus will move to (c) the new precise measurement of the muon gyromagnetic ratio, the muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab.   The goal of PEN is to reach the precision of 5 parts in 10,000 for the branching ratio of the electronic decay of the pion, which is the most accurate experimental test of lepton universality (LU) available.   At present, precision of the pi-e2 decay measurements lags behind the SM theoretical predictions by more than an order of magnitude.  A number of physics scenarios outside the SM would lead to LU violation.  LU, and lepton properties in general, carry added significance due to developments in neutrino physics.  Nab is a highly rate unpolarized measurement of the electron-antineutrino correlation parameter ""a"" with accuracy of a few parts in 1000, and the first measurement of the neutron decay parameter ""b"", the Fierz interference term.  Nab aims to resolve the persistent inconsistencies in the determination of the nucleon axial vector form factor and, consequently, of the Vud term in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix, and to provide new limits on possible extensions of the Standard Model, such as left-right symmetric models, leptoquarks, etc., by exploiting the unique advantages of neutron decay, one of the most basic and theoretically best understood processes in nuclear physics."

If ordinary matter is heated up to temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees, hotter than the core of the sun, atoms and molecules cease to exist and even protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei melt. The remaining primordial soup of quarks and gluons filled the very early universe. We can recreate quark gluon plasma in our largest particle colliders by smashing heavy nuclei into each other. Experimental programs at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the USA study the properties of quark gluon plasma. This project will support research that will improve our understanding of the formation and properties of quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. The PI and his collaborators will use computer simulations and advanced statistical methods to reach this goal. Funding is provided to support training for a graduate students and junior scientists in nuclear science.<br/><br/>Quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions emerges from the highly complex gluon fields that are initially created in nuclear collisions.

The same gluon fields will also be studied through their interaction with fast quarks. The PI and his group will be able to use the JETSCAPE framework for large scale computational simulations of nuclear collisions. They will study various aspects of jets and heavy quarks being quenched in quark gluon plasma. They will then extract properties of quark gluon plasma using multiple constraints. For example,  the strength of quenching of quarks and heavy quarks, and the viscosity of quark gluon plasma can be independently measured and are mutually related. Testing these relations will be an important step towards a deeper understanding of the dynamics of quark gluon plasma. The PI and his group will also use advanced statistical methods and machine learning applied to data to understand the mechanisms of hadron formation from quarks and gluons.

A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.

Partnerships with a local minority public high school and the Adler Planetarium will genuinely engage students, educators, and the broader public in the mystery of dark matter and the status of current research, via regular classroom visits, field trips, mentoring, teacher immersion experiences, and in-the-museum programming. This will have a deep and broad impact, directly reaching teachers, planetarium staff, hundreds of URM students, and thousands of museum visitors (hundreds of thousands indirectly). The research program offers excellent opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students, making them part of a cutting edge project in fundamental science.<br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to contribute to XENON1T, a direct detection WIMP experiment deployed at the Gran Sasso laboratory built underneath the Apennine Mountains in Italy (LNGS), in the assembly, commissioning and early operations of the detector, scheduled for summer 2015. The PI also plans to develop refined analysis strategies which are expected to enhance the performance of the ionization/scintillation identification methods that are exploited in XENON1T to suppress the dominant / background. To achieve this goal, the PI will make a series of dedicated measurements with a small-scale xenon detector designed to collect pure samples of nuclear and electron recoils. This will permit an exhaustive investigation of the ionization and scintillation processes that govern low-energy interactions in liquid xenon. These data, which are not easily extractable from XENON1T directly, will then be used to increase the sensitivity to WIMPs through improvements in the calibration and rejection of backgrounds."

(ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."

Although there are a billion neutrinos for every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-called ""weak"" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of the fundamental particles.  One of the big mysteries in neutrino science is how they change (or ?oscillate?) from one type to another. Neutrino oscillation experiments explore possible explanations for the difference between matter and anti-matter in the Universe. This project will improve the computational tools for simulating and estimating neutrino fluxes for existing and future neutrino oscillation experiments.  These tools are necessary for efficient and cost-effective design of the neutrino beams and detectors used in high-energy particle physics.  <br/> <br/>The best available data on hadron production cross sections and other experimental inputs will be incorporated into existing beam-line simulations, and improved tools for rapid iteration of studies for novel beam-line designs will be created.

If the original star is between eight and twenty times the mass of the sun, the supernova leaves behind a neutron star. Neutron stars are ultra-dense objects with the mass of the sun and a diameter of about 15 miles. Normal matter is made of atoms consisting of electrons and nuclei, nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, and neutrons and protons, in turn, are made of up and down quarks. The gravitational force in the center of a neutron star, however, is sufficient to compress neutrons and protons together so tightly that neutrons and protons may be forced to convert into exotic particles containing strange quarks. The question of whether or not strange quarks are present in neutron stars, and the more general question of the nature of extremely dense matter, are some of the principal questions facing the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities. This project aims to answer these questions and to determine the nature of matter in the center of neutron stars where gravity compresses matter to a thousand trillion times the density of water. This project involves training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellow. Community outreach includes the education of students through the continued development of a Studio Physics course, involvement in research, and a web-based visualization of neutron stars.<br/><br/>Nuclear experiments and observations of neutron stars have successfully generated novel constraints on the equation of state of matter at densities near and above the central densities in atomic nuclei. However, our current understanding of high-densities is limited: we do not yet know the composition of the ground state. This project uses a combination of nuclear theory matched to nuclear data and neutron star observations to determine the composition of neutron star cores. Modern models of strongly-interacting matter will be combined with new nuclear structure calculations of neutron-rich nuclei in order to construct state of the art models of the neutron star crust and core. These models, and their concomitant uncertainties, will be calibrated with nuclear data and compared with neutron star cooling, mass, and radius observations. For example, neutron star cooling data has already given indications of fast cooling arising from a large proton-to-neutron ratio. This project will study the posterior probability distribution for the proton-to-neutron ratio and several other observables that will give insights into neutron star composition. <br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at NSF."

In this context, the theoretical research to be performed by the PI will play an important role in understanding the experimental data and will allow for new insights regarding the fundamental processes that take place in stars and the specific role played by the neutrino properties. In addition, this state-of-the-art research project will provide excellent opportunities for the training of students. <br/><br/>A major area of investigation in particle astrophysics concerns the physics of O(10) MeV neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae that presents a strategic opportunity for upcoming neutrino detectors. It is planned to study the potential of these detectors to measure the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos  from a galactic supernova burst, with minimal theoretical priors, to distinguish different oscillation scenarios. Hours before a star becomes a supernova, neutrinos from the Silicon burning phase might be detectable. The flux of these neutrinos will be modeled in detail, using a new calculation method that includes the nuclear beta processes. Supernova neutrinos can also be detected in the form of diffuse flux from the cosmic population of supernovae. The study of this flux will be revitalized in the light of recent developments, with focus on detectability, and on the potential to measure important physical quantities from the diffuse flux.  At higher energies, E ~ TeV - PeV, extraterrestrial neutrinos were discovered in 2013. This project considers star formation as a possible origin of these neutrinos.

The LHC discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was further confirmation of this success. However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory as it fails to explain dark matter and it does not provide an explanation for the mass of light neutrinos. Interestingly, these insufficiencies appear to be part of an intriguing overlap in the sciences describing the largest and smallest scales of the universe: proposed extensions of the Standard Model also shed light on our understanding of the evolution of our universe and the dark matter relic density measured by astronomers. This work exploits the rich particle physics program at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland to search for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The expanding LHC data set collected by the CMS experiment offers significant opportunity for new discovery, providing greater sensitivity for new physics signatures which would address questions in both particle physics and cosmology.

In addition, this effort leverages searches for TeV-scale particles using tau lepton reconstruction and identification, which combined with other technicques, enables targeted searches for interesting new physics such as dark matter, compressed spectra SUSY, heavy neutrinos, leptoquarks, and new heavy neutral gauge bosons such as Z-prime. This research is also enabled by hardware operations and development work on the CMS pixel detector and on development of advanced machine learning data analysis techniques.

Although thermal conductivity is well understood on macroscopic, everyday scales, heat transport on the tiny size scales relevant for today's modern microelectronics - at the crossover between regimes governed by classical versus quantum mechanics - has resisted scientific study.  This project, which will simulate nanoscale thermal conductivity using a system of atoms that will be ionized, trapped with electric fields, and probed using lasers, is a step towards understanding heat flow at the crossover between quantum and classical mechanics.  Taking place at an undergraduate institution, students will be involved in all aspects of the experiments - designing and building lasers, electronics, and data acquisition systems, writing software, and carrying out data collection, providing superb training for future careers in the sciences.<br/><br/>The central idea underpinning this work will be to co-trap multiple isotopes of calcium to create a sympathetically cooled, linear chain of ions.  The end ions of the chain will be 44Ca+ ions, laser cooled to different average vibron numbers, analogous to thermal baths of different temperatures.  40Ca+ will form the central `bulk' of the chain.  Resolved sideband spectroscopy, individually addressed to specific ions in the chain, will be used to read out the average number of vibrons at each ion, equivalent to a temperature distribution.  Under typical circumstances vibron transport along the chain is expected to be ballistic, leading to a near-uniform distribution in the bulk.  However, inducing vibron dephasing by introducing localized noise to the trapping potentials or strengthening radial-axial mode coupling across the linear-to-zig-zag structural phase transition will break the chain into thermally disconnected subsystems.  This will allow observation of the onset of diffusive thermal transport, manifested as a non-uniform gradient of the average vibron numbers.  This work will extend quite naturally to include study of techniques for improving sympathetic cooling of linear ion chains, a central tool for a wide array of experiments pursuing quantum information processing with trapped ions.  This research program is thus expected to aid in our understanding of nanoscale thermal conductivity and also to inform the next generation of experiments in trapped ion quantum computation and quantum simulation.  Additionally, isotope shift measurements made as part of this work will contribute to the understanding of atomic and nuclear theory."

The proposed research, through a combination of biophysical/structural studies and biochemical/functional assays, will elucidate the nature and importance of these two levels of regulation in a bacteriophage RdRp. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will provide training for students from various backgrounds at multiple stages of their professional preparation.

Comparison of two distantly related enzymes (from bacteriophage phi-12 and poliovirus) will allow generalization to a broad class of viral RdRps. In addition to dynamics, protein-protein interactions within polymerase complexes exert higher order control over the activity of their constituent RdRps. Modifications in these interactions lead to altered RdRp function, and in extreme cases to non-infectious viruses. The proposed studies will define these regulatory interactions in the context of phi-12 that contains a simple 4-protein polymerase complex.

Comprised of a variety of particle types, cosmic rays arrive at Earth with a wide range of energies. High energy cosmic rays are composed of atomic nuclei, ranging in mass from protons up to iron. Just what percentage of the population is light, and what percentage is heavy, is still under active study. Because cosmic rays are charged and their trajectories bend in magnetic fields, they do not point back to their origin; determining the origin of these particles is an unsolved problem with a 100-year heritage. Features in the energy spectrum (such as kinks, bumps, or changes in slope) are important clues, thought to be related to changes in composition and origin. The goal of this project is to measure the composition and energy spectrum of cosmic rays by using data from IceTop, the surface component of the IceCube Observatory located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, in coincidence with IceCube data. <br/><br/>The project has been designed to include self-contained projects appropriate for undergraduates, a unique training and learning opportunity for UAA undergraduates not only to participate in active research and discovery, but also to be an important part of a large international effort. In addition, the construction of a muon telescope and small-scale air shower array using scintillators is planned as a tool for outreach, education, and training in the field of particle astrophysics.<br/><br/>IceTop is an 81-element extensive air-shower array located on the surface, above IceCube. This project first focuses on improving the reconstruction of cosmic ray air showers with IceTop, especially at high energies where current reconstruction techniques are underperforming. It will study snow attenuation, the curvature and fluctuations of the shower front, and the separate treatment of coincident and isolated signals in the detector. The project includes simulations to study how different hadronic interaction models impact the signals seen in IceTop. With plentiful data statistics and advanced data analysis techniques available, IceTop is capable of delivering results of relevance to the field of cosmic ray astrophysics: a detailed cosmic ray energy spectrum, and the mass composition of cosmic rays as a function of energy."

By recording the collisions of protons at the LHC, the ATLAS experiment studies nature at the shortest distances and highest masses ever accessible in a laboratory.  In essence, it is simultaneously the world's most powerful microscope and an experiment creating conditions that existed in nature only near the time of the Big Bang.  Studies there have already led to discovery of a new fundamental particle, the Higgs Boson.  This discovery is of such high scientific impact that the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to the people who first predicted the existence of this particle.<br/><br/>This NSF award enables upgrades of the ATLAS experimental apparatus needed for high precision studies of Higgs Boson properties and a wide variety of searches for particles needed to explain unresolved puzzles.  An example of one such puzzle is ""What is the dark matter which makes up nearly 30% of the universe""?  There are many other similar questions. The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 Teraelectronvolts (TeV) data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.<br/><br/>This award provides support for Dr. Hobbs at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and his collaborators at three U.S. universities to upgrade the ATLAS detector so that it can continue to operate efficiently at higher energies for a longer time and at a higher rate. This upgrade will enable scientists to collect data to search for new physics to explain inconsistencies in the particle theory that arise as the energy is increased and to fully understand how the Higgs boson fits into a fundamental theory of the universe.<br/>   <br/>The universities supported by this award will build new instrumentation to be installed in the ATLAS detector, which is necessary in order to carry out a real-time selection and collection of data and provide a better measurement of particle energies.  In addition to producing results which advance fundamental scientific knowledge, the work associated with these upgrades trains students, young researchers and technicians to carry out basic research by formulating questions and procedures to understand what is not known, and it also trains them to develop and operate complex, custom electronics systems and advanced computer algorithms needed to sustain extremely high data rates and classify large, complex data sets in fractions of a second."

Over the past 40 years there has been a tremendous theoretical and experimental advancement that brought us to the discovery of quarks as fundamental bricks of matter and the laws that govern their interactions. The generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are theoretical tools used to describe hadrons (particles that are made from quarks and gluons) in terms of their constituents.   These distributions give fully correlated quark information in both coordinate and momentum space, allowing access to crucial properties such as the angular momentum distribution of quarks in the nucleon and explaining how quarks contribute to the overall properties of nucleons such as their electric and axial charge. This project will focus on experiments at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, VA using the recently upgraded Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS12). Jefferson lab with its ""intermediate"" energies is a unique facility to explore the region sensitive to the valence quarks, and the large acceptance CLAS12 detector will allow the extraction of GPDs over large kinematic ranges. The PI of this proposal is a co-spokesperson of three experiments aimed to extraction of GPDs. The PI will take an active role in the data taking at Jefferson Lab and will contribute to the data reduction and analysis. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project and in addition to gaining experience in data analysis in particle physics, they will develop broader skills, such as coding and statistics.<br/><br/><br/>The cleanest way to access GPDs is via deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), where the virtual photon interacts with a single quark of the nucleon radiating a real photon. At leading twist, the soft process is described by four chiral-even GPDs: the quark-helicity independent, H, E and the quark helicity dependent H-tilde and E-tilde. The focus of this project is to measure target and beam asymmetries and cross sections for the DVCS with proton and neutron targets.   These observables on different nucleons have unique sensitivity to a subset of the four GPDs, and their simultaneous determination allows for a comprehensive extraction of GPDs for the proton and neutron and flavor decomposition. In September 2018, the unpolarized proton target run will start, providing a significant amount of additional production data. Experiments on the neutron target and the polarized proton target are expected to run in the next three years. Fairfield University will contribute to the physics analysis and other aspects of the data reduction such as quality tests, calibration and software development. In addition to the work on the new data, as it becomes available, Fairfield University will continue to complete simulation work in preparation to the upcoming experiments to study the optimal configuration of the detector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cosmic ray antideuteron particles are a particularly interesting potential signature of dark matter annihilation.  This CAREER award supports scientists at the University of Hawaii to study dark matter by performing the first measurements of the cosmic-ray antideuteron flux.  The group will utilize data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), currently operating onboard the International Space Station, and data from the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), a balloon experiment that is under development.  This award will support scientific investigations that utilize the complementary capabilities of both experiments to perform high-sensitivity measurements of cosmic-ray antideuterons.  The group is also developing a summer course to teach computer programming to local high school students.  Students will be taught programming skills using Raspberry Pi computers.  Mimicking scientific ballooning operations, the devices will be mounted on kites to measure temperatures and humidity, and take aerial pictures.<br/> <br/>The planned program includes the development of antideuteron production physics simulations, analysis of AMS data, simulations and calibration of the GAPS detectors, and ultimately analysis of GAPS data.

These data will quantify input energy partition among different energy modes. (iii) Measurements of solvated electrons in the near-surface liquid layer.

The goal of these efforts  is to answer questions about how our Universe came into exisitence and how it evolved to look the way it does today. The PI is a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the large particle detectors at the LHC that collects data produced by the collisions of 40 million protons every second. The CMS collaboration consists of 3000 scientists the world over that study all the different particles that come out of these collisions in an effort to understand precisely how they were produced and whether or not there are indications of new Physics: cracks in our current understanding of Nature or glimpses of new and exciting theories.  This project looks for new physics through the search for as-yet-unobserved decays of the top quark, one of the particles that make up the list of fundamental particles known to date. <br/><br/>The PI will be conducting an analysis to search for baryon-number violating (BNV) decays of the top quark. The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle yet discovered, and while it was first observed 20 years ago, it is only relatively recently that experiments have begun to collect enough data to study them in detail. This analysis is related to another as-of-yet unobserved phenomenon, proton decay. Some theories suggest that the same protons that are found in every atom will eventually decay away and these theories are invoked to try to explain why our Universe is dominated by matter and does not consist of equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Any sign of BNV decays, whether in top quarks or protons or other particles, would instantly change how we understand fundamental particle interactions. A preliminary analysis was performed with the first set of data from CMS, but in the next couple of years, we will have 10x the data to work with and so we will be much more sensitive to any signs of new physics. In parallel, the PI will continue to work on innovative outreach techniques, such as making real experimental data from CMS and other experiments available to teachers and the general public, simplifed so that anyone can use it and learn from it. The PI will also continue to host high school teachers for workshops where they build cloud chambers, one of the earliest particle detectors, for use in their classrooms."

The Standard Model of subatomic physics provides an overarching theoretical framework that describes all known forces except gravity.  It has been extensively tested, and it successfully predicts almost every phenomenon that has ever been observed in experiments at particle accelerators.  Nevertheless, it is known to be incomplete, since it does not have a way to explain dark matter or dark energy, and it does not account for the asymmetry of matter over antimatter that allowed the structures of our universe to form.  Muons are in many ways similar to electrons, but with a mass approximately 207 times higher, and they are unstable, decaying in a few microseconds; they appear in nature as cosmic rays.  The Muon g-2 Experiment measures the rate at which the of muons rotate as they orbit in a magnetic field. That rotation could arise from the coupling of muons to new particles.  The experiment has been constructed and has completed its first year of data collection.  With close mentoring from the PI and other collaborators, students will maintain and upgrade particle detectors, assist with taking data at Fermilab, and analyze data. They will have opportunities to present their work at conferences and collaboration meetings. The professional development of these students is a primary focus of this project.  Entering classes at Regis University are continuing a trend of increasing ethnic and socioeconomic diversity, so the students supported by this award represent a broadening in the participation by groups that are currently underrepresented in physics research.<br/><br/>The Muon g-2 experiment measures the muon's anomalous magnetic moment.  Previous measurements of this quantity differ from theoretical predictions by about 3.5 standard deviations.  The new measurement at Fermilab will record 20 times more muon decays than experiment 821 at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Systematic uncertainties will also be reduced, leading to an expected precision of 140 parts per billion.  Consequently, the experiment has the potential to discover the indirect effects of new particles and interactions with very high statistical significance. The range of possible new physics is wide; it could include ideas such as supersymmetry, light weakly-interacting particles from a ""dark sector,"" axion-like particles, or extra dimensions.  Conversely, if the result turns out to agree with the Standard Model, it would provide a strong constraint on all of these new physics models.  The experiment measures the rate of spin precession in flight for a muon beam in a weak-focusing 1.5 Tesla storage ring magnet.  Several beam dynamics effects directly contribute to the systematic error, including coherent betatron oscillations (CBO) and muon losses, which are partly driven by the CBO.   The fiber harps, which were refurbished and are maintained by the Regis group, are used to characterize and to minimize the CBO.  The anticipated precision of the experiment assumes that the systematic errors from CBO and muon losses will be reduced by factors of 2.3 and 4.5, respectively.  The Regis group participates in the analysis of fiber harp data in order to understand these beam dynamics effects; it also contributes to other parts of the analysis effort, including data quality control and run selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010. The data are being analyzed and published. The experiment has shown many results, but none so far have clearly demonstrated new physics. LHCb has proposed an upgrade to be completed in the 2018-2019 time-frame when the LHC accelerator will not be running. This upgrade will allow LHCb to collect an order of magnitude more data in decay modes that will either show new physics or severely restrict the allowed mass range. LHCb is comprised of about 10 different sub-detectors or sub-systems. The Syracuse group has the responsibility of upgrading a part of the charged particle tracking system currently called the ""TT."" The intent is to significantly enhance the capabilities of this system above and beyond the requirement that data can be taken at an order of magnitude higher luminosity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The intellectual merit of this award lies in the leading role the Syracuse group plays in the physics analysis that it is part of LHCb. This analysis sheds light on important aspects of our understanding of the Standard Model, including Charge Parity asymmetry which could explain the preponderance of matter in the universe as opposed to antimatter. In addition, the upgraded LHCb detector  will allow a much more sensitive search for BSM physics. The main deliverable will be a new inner tracking device, the UT. This device will increase the data throughput over the current tracking device by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics. The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250-micron-thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the construction and testing of the detector that will be constructed. For many years a steady stream of undergraduates have been working in the PIs laboratories, where   it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have both hardware experience as well as data analysis capabilities. The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse Quarknet program to involve high school teachers and some of their better students as well. Test results from this detector will be discussed at conferences and published. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results."

Complex multicellular life would be inconceivable without the evolution of space filling circulatory systems to distribute nutrients and collect waste. Vascular systems are ubiquitous and they have some common features, but also distinctive differences. Taming that complexity can provide intuition about ecological adaptations in plants to deal with intermittent or long term drought.

The PI will work with education experts at her institution to integrate a research approach into a classroom setting at the introductory course level and expose undergraduates very early on to authentic research experiences. In addition, in partnership with the Biology department, she will design and implement a pilot program to create a handheld device application for use by the general public that allows users to scan barcodes and access information about plants specimens at the botanical gardens on campus.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate the physical principles behind the emergence of such hierarchically organized, reticulate circulatory systems.

(b) Why did these hierarchically nested structures emerge independently several times in both plants and animals? (c) How is hierarchical nestedness maintained in animal vascular systems where vascular remodeling predicts heavy pruning of the vascular structures?

Predicted by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of General Relativity, gravitational waves eluded detection for a hundred years, until on September 14, 2015, shortly after the major upgrade, the advanced LIGO detectors observed a gravitational wave signal from two colliding black holes. For the first time, LIGO detected ripples in the fabric of space-time arriving at the Earth from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe. This confirmed a major prediction of General Relativity and opened an unprecedented new window onto the cosmos. Gravitational-waves provide a direct probe of complex astrophysical systems and provide a unique astronomical tool to study the Universe. In the next few years hundreds detections of sources are expected as advanced LIGO reaches its design sensitivity and the other instruments join the world-wide network of gravitational wave detectors. The experiments with these detectors will address key research questions, including the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, the role of compact objects in high energy emission, the properties of nuclear matter, the nature of gamma-ray-bursts, and the existence of intermediate-mass black holes, probing the structure and evolution of the Universe and physics beyond General Relativity.<br/><br/>The proposed research will reinforce success of the LIGO data analysis effort and support new innovative research projects that have a potential to produce transformative results. It targets the most extreme astrophysical events, such as recently discovered mergers of neutron stars and black holes, and holds a promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical phenomena. The proposed searches utilize the detection and reconstruction algorithms that use minimal model assumptions and that are capable of detecting gravitational-wave transients in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. Among the primary detection targets is a core collapse supernovae (CCSN), which will address a number of open questions in astrophysics, such as the role of neutrino in CCSN and the neutron star equations of state. Also, the proposed activities will extend the most promising advanced LIGO searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not yet explored by the existing template algorithms. The proposed searches have a potential to establish the existence of intermediate mass binary black holes and test the theory of general relativity at the high field regime by comparing the reconstructed signal waveforms with the numerical relativity predictions. Novel methods are proposed for studies of the compact binary post-merger signals, including quasi-normal gravitational waves emitted by the remnant black holes and post-merger signatures of the binary neutron star systems. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization will enable joint observations with the electromagnetic telescopes and neutrino detectors, advancing the field of the multi-messenger astronomy. This award will also support the planned upgrade of the baseline LIGO data analysis algorithms for the future LIGO runs and increase the scientific potential of the proposed gravitational-wave observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date the only sources that have been detected are merging black holes.   However, there are many other possible sources for gravitational waves, some known and others unknown.  The search for these sources, and how they contribute to the structure of the cosmos, lies at the heart of this new discipline.   Their detection through LIGO relies on the development of data analysis tools that allow the extraction of the gravitational wave signal from the interferometer background.  The analysis of LIGO data is of such complexity that new techniques are currently being developed to cover the large parameter space spanned by potential sources. This award supports research on how to accelerate data analysis pipelines through application of new numerical methods that employ techniques previously developed by the group from general mathematical principles.<br/><br/>This award supports a systematic approach for deriving closed form approximations of waveforms emitted by binary black hole collisions. These closed form expressions will not sacrifice fidelity or modeling accuracy, will not perform phenomenological fits, but instead will find closed form expressions from ab-initio simulations of the full Einstein equations. Though the approach will be generic, during this project only the case of two non-spinning black holes will be considered. The goal of this project is to provide the LIGO project with a very fast way of evaluating gravitational waveforms for data analysis. This project will be a continuation of the group's research on surrogate and reduced order modeling and sparse representations, with applications to gravitational waves. It will add the additional thrust of symbolic regression through genetic programming. The goal is to design a systematic framework for deriving closed form expressions for gravitational waves from different types of sources. The scope will be limited in this project to demonstrating a proof of concept using existing surrogate reduced basis models for non-spinning black hole collisions."

It is a 1 gigaton Cherenkov detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by Cosmic Rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.<br/><br/>Students and postdocs working on this project will benefit by training in particle astrophysics, instrumentation and data analysis of very large data sets. An educational program including high-school students, teachers and undergraduate students will continue. In collaboration with CEISMC and GoSTEM at Georgia Tech the PI and members of his group present lectures and hands on demonstrations on the topics of particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics. <br/><br/>The most powerful events in nature are usually transitory or episodic. Examples are the explosions of massive stars (core collapse supernovae, CC-SNe), high-energy emission by super-massive black holes at the center of galaxies (active galactic nuclei, AGNs), and the very energetic jets that power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This award will support the use of IceCube data to study very-high-energy neutrino astrophysical transients, including GRBs, choked GRBs and, potentially, still unknown types of astrophysical objects. The project will address two topics: a) Are choked GRBs related to CC-SNe and do they produce neutrinos? b) Are the sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux, recently discovered by IceCube, transient? Using IceCube data the Georgia Tech group will search for neutrino transients of one second to one day in duration in the 30 to 300 billion electron-volts energy range. The discovery of a neutrino burst with this search may reveal that CC-SNe and GRBs are part of a continuous class of astrophysical objects and that jets are also a feature of CC-SNe."

The goal of this research is to study the forces between quarks inside the nucleon.  The project looks at how the quarks form quantum states of the nucleon after being bombarded by an energetic beam of particles, and studying how these quantum states release the energy in the form of new particles.  By comparing these measurements to theoretical calculations, we can learn more about the forces between quarks that are confined inside the nucleon. Two experiments are included in the effort. The first one at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) uses a beam of particles called pi-mesons that impinge on a proton, resulting in a nucleon resonance that decays into two pi-mesons.  This new experiment will expand by a factor of 100 the data for that reaction process.  The last data of this type was taken back in the 1970s, and now precise data for this final state are needed as input to theoretical calculations of nucleon resonances. The second experiment is at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, located in Newport News, Virginia. This experiment uses an electron beam impinging on a proton to create a nucleon resonance, with the final particles going into a large acceptance spectrometer, called CLAS12.  The nucleon resonance spectrum tells us about how quarks interact with each other inside the proton. Early career scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students play an important role in this project, which provides them with unique opportunities to further develop their training and education in leading research facilities.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to understand the proton and how its valence quarks can be excited into resonant states.  This moment is an exciting time to pursue this goal because we now have the theoretical tool of lattice gauge theory to calculate nucleon resonances from basic principles (the non-perturbative solutions to the equations of Quantum Chromodynamics, or QCD).  As an analogy, measurements of excited states of atomic hydrogen led first to the simplified Bohr model, then to calculations using Schrodinger's equation, and finally to QED.  Similarly, measurements of the excited states of the nucleon (N*'s) led first to the simplified constituent quark model, and then to calculations directly from QCD using lattice gauge theory. The latter predicts many more N* resonances than have been extracted from experimental data.  Known as the missing baryons problem, it continues to motivate research on N* spectroscopy.  The two experiments described above, one at J-PARC and the other at CLAS12, will help to resolve the N* spectrum and ultimately provide a proving ground for theoretical models of quarks."

The measurement will address an intriguing discrepancy between a prior measurement and the Standard Model prediction of the muon?s characteristics and is sensitive to new particles and undetected forces that uniquely complement other efforts at high energy colliders and elsewhere.

The measurement will address the longstanding discrepancy of ~3.5 sigma between the previous BNL E821 measurement and the Standard Model prediction.   It represents a key test of the Standard Model and has broad sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. It complements other searches for new physics at the energy, intensity and cosmic frontiers. The muon g-2 project has involved the relocation of the E821 muon storage ring from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab as well as major upgrades of the detector, electronics and acquisition sub-systems.  The installation of the storage ring and its associated instrumentation on the Fermilab muon campus was completed in 2017.

The group researches the forces that keep the basic components of sub-atomic particles together, known as the ""strong"" force. They expect to identify a new form of sub-atomic particles (exotics) that can greatly contribute to the understanding of the strong force. These exotics will provide an external manifestation of the strong force that otherwise is hidden (confined inside the particles). NSU faculty and undergraduate students are developing a software infrastructure to perform the analysis of big data in a user-friendly manner. Specifically, they are exploring new statistical techniques, hardware options and software programing to help the analysis. The NSU campus is near Jefferson Lab, providing NSU students opportunities to participate in research all year around. It is a goal of this project to strengthen the national participation of undergraduate minorities in nuclear and particle physics research. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), such as NSU, have been more successful than majority institutions in retaining minority students at the undergraduate level and introducing them to graduate programs in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>Norfolk State University is participating in the experimental study of the strong interactions by testing basic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using Meson Spectroscopy. This project proposes to continue the group's participation in the GlueX (Hall D) and MesonEx (Hall B) experiments at Jefferson Lab. Meson spectroscopy is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the strong interaction at intermediate energies with the goal of finding more details about QCD confinement. NSU had been involved in hardware construction and software development for both experiments and in the data analysis of previous CLAS experiments related to meson photo-production. The group proposes to continue its current involvement in the analyses and software development of meson photo-production performing full Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) of few body final states. The spectroscopy studies concentrate in channels for the study of exotics and strangeonia states. They are working to obtain more efficient, user friendly and fast analysis code for pursuing amplitude analysis. GlueX and MesonEx will obtain data with such better systematic and statistical uncertainties that the limitations of the current methods of analysis will be exposed. Therefore new refinements in analysis will be required, and a close collaboration between theorists (models) and experimentalists (software), to obtain definite results. Through this program, NSU faculty and undergraduate students will directly participate in the software development and analysis of data from experiments in the forefront of nuclear physics research. NSU is one of the leading HBCU's in the country and its main campus is conveniently located at a short distance from Jefferson Lab.

Neutrons which are not bound in an atomic nucleus will decay in about 880 seconds into a proton, electron and an antineutrino.    Studying characteristics of this property of neutrons with increasing precision allows a deeper knowledge about the framework upon which the cosmos was built. One experiment, named aCORN, has collected data at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research to measure the correlation between the emission directions of the electron and antineutrino more precisely than ever before.  Another experiment, UCNtau, is using magnets and gravity to trap very low energy neutrons to measure the neutron's lifetime to less than a second. Experiments trapping very low energy neutrons and subsequently counting the undecayed survivors after a period of time are tending to give results significantly different than experiments which involve a higher energy beam of neutrons and the detection of protons produced in the decay. Finding the cause of this discrepancy is of great interest as it has the potential of uncovering a new feature of neutron decay. This award will allow the Principle Investigator (PI) and DePauw University Undergraduate Researchers to make important contributions to these two experiments.  The aCORN experiment has been the flagship project of the PI's research program, which in many ways has acted as a training ground for his students to prepare them for research and teaching.  The students who participate in this research gain a broad range of hardware and software skills that prepare them for careers in STEM fields or to pursue graduate degrees also in STEM areas.<br/><br/>The motivations for a more precise measurement of the electron-antineutrino correlation include an improved model independent test of the Electroweak Standard Model and a measurement of the ratio of weak axial vector to vector coupling constants that does not depend on neutron polarimetry. In addition, this measurement, along with a more precise neutron lifetime, would allow a determination of Vud - an element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix - solely from free neutron decay and thus not complicated by nuclear structure dependent corrections. As the CKM matrix is required to be unitary, this would provide a test of the Standard Model.  Knowing the neutron lifetime better also allows for a stringent test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.  The aCORN experiment depends on the simultaneous detection of electrons and protons to infer the relative emission direction of the antineutrino. The PI has developed a proton tracking simulation that determines the efficiency of the aCORN proton focusing system for the first data set which is important in establishing the size of the systematic error that would result from imperfect proton detection. The PI will apply this analysis to the second data set and fully analyze the NG-C data. The techniques used in the aCORN proton simulation will be employed to design a proton detector system in the UCNtau experiment to allow determination of the neutron lifetime by observation of the protons which is closer to what the neutron beam lifetime experiments actually measure. Such a measurement could be instrumental in understanding the discrepancy between these experiments."

The last major elements of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics (which describes the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear interactions of fundamental particles) have been experimentally validated in the past decade.  Detailed measurements of particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the decays of  B-mesons by the BABAR and Belle collaborations led to Kobayashi and Maskawa sharing the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN discovered a Higgs-like boson in 2012, leading to Englert and Higgs sharing the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. The codes and toolkits to be developed here will enable HEP experiments to search more effectively for phenomena not described by the SM, sometimes called Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics.  ATLAS and CMS are searching for direct evidence of BSM physics at the highest energies. Belle-II, the next generation electron-positron flavor factory being built in Japan, has a design luminosity two orders of magnitude greater than that of Belle, providing complementary BSM sensitivity in very high statistics studies of B-meson decays, charm mixing, and searches for lepton flavor violation. The LHCb experiment at CERN has already surpassed BaBar and Belle by more than an order of magnitude in many channels, and the resulting BSM constraints complement those from ATLAS and CMS. Analyzing the data from all these experiments will require disproportionately more computing power at a modest increase in cost.  In addition to developing generally useful tools, the statistical analysis toolkit developed here will be applied to analyze data from LHCb."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions, it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This project focuses on the study of the properties of special types of particles, mesons, whose nature can reveal information about fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>The work in this award will use data collected at the Belle and Belle-II experiments at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan. The new Belle-II is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron collider. The main goal of the Belle program is to detect particles made of a quark-anti-quark pair, so called mesons. In particular those mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). These mesons are described in the SM by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By studying these mesons, one can probe for BSM fundamental physics processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark Matter. <br/><br/>The Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples recorded at the bottomonium resonances in the mass range of 10 GeV, the so-called Upsilon resonances. At these resonant energies the electron positron beam particles have a much higher probability of producing B mesons, allowing experimenters to acquire large statistics and observe rare phenomena. The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a focus on resonant states that probe the limits of our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and improving the theoretical understanding in lattice QCD (the techniques used to make computer predictions of QCD calculations). The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the program are exemplary, fostering greater exposure to scientific research among students and teachers in rural Northeast Iowa, through masterclasses for High School students and providing computational opportunities for young women through the regional Girls Who Code Organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What is the nature of any new physics not described by the Standard Model - our current understanding of how particles and forces interact?  This question will be addressed by precision measurements of the weak charges of the proton and electron at two large collaborative experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia.  The proton and electron's weak charges are the weak force analogs of the common electric charges of these particles. The weak charges are precisely predicted in the Standard Model.  Any deviation of measurements from these predictions could be evidence of yet undiscovered massive particles that represent new physics beyond our current understanding. The program will support graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, who will form an essential part of this project.  The anticipated activities cover a range of hardware and software tasks that will provide excellent training for these individuals.  This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers both in basic research and in more applied research and industry.  <br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support activities on three parity-violating electron scattering experiments at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF).  The Qweak experiment will measure the proton's neutral weak charge via parity-violating electron scattering at very low momentum transfer. The proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. During the period of this program, the group will primarily be contributing to a complete analysis of the weak charge result as well as finalizing analyses to extract physics results from the Qweak data for two other topics - a probe of hadronic parity violation in the N to Delta transition and a measurement of the transverse asymmetry in Moller scattering. The MOLLER experiment is an approved TJNAF experiment intended for the upgraded 12 GeV TJNAF.  It will measure the electron's neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at a very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high-energy colliders.  It should have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios.  During the period of this project, the group will make important contributions to this experiment by working on beam charge and position monitor upgrades, luminosity monitor and background detector development and construction, scanner detector development, and simulation design studies. Neutron radii in neutron-rich nuclear provide an important test of nuclear structure with applications to neutron star structure and heavy ion collisions.  The PREX-II and CREX experiments are anticipated to run in this period and determine the neutron radii in lead-208 and calcium-48.  The group will provide large angle scattering monitors and a setup for linearity testing and will contribute to the analysis of beam monitoring and modulation data and data-taking shift support."

At the same time this work addresses the technical demands of the two experiments by pushing the limits of magnetic field measurements.  Many potential additional applications of these techniques may be extended into biology, neuroscience and medicine.  This research provides challenging research projects for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Michigan.   A diverse cohort of graduate students are working on aspects of this research and will join former students in contributing to the National interest as teachers, researchers in physics and biomedical fields and leaders in industry.<br/><br/>This research consists of advancing two precision measurements: the muon magnetic moment anomaly g - 2 and the beta-neutrino asymmetry parameter in neutron decay. These address the deepest question in elementary particle and nuclear physics, namely what lies beyond the Standard Model, by putting precise predictions to the test in systems most sensitive to new physics.   This University of Michigan group is contributing to the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment, which is completing the first production data run with the goal of equaling the experimental precision of the previous measurement with much better control and understanding of the systematic errors, and preparing for the upcoming data runs with the goal of improving the experimental precision by a factor of four.  More specifically, the group has developed critical innovations for precision measurement of the magnetic field and its absolute calibration, and innovations in the most challenging aspect of the analysis of the field-measurement data, namely interpolating between calibration runs to track changes in the magnetic field and its spatial variations.  The group will also complete commissioning and begin Nab, a new precision measurement of the beta-neutrino asymmetry parameter a in neutron decay that also probes physics Beyond the Standard Model by way of redundantly measuring the parameter lambda, the ratio of axial vector to vector coupling constants, which is also determined by the beta asymmetry (A). The neutron spin flipper designed and built at Michigan has been moved to the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beam (FNPB) at the SNS at ORNL.

The Higgs boson discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN completes the suite of predicted Standard Model particles and provides a mechanism for generating elementary particle masses. However, the current formulation of the Standard Model does not account for the observed value of the Higgs boson mass, making discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model a primary goal of the LHC experiments, including those being carried out in this project involving the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS).<br/><br/>This work will focus on searches for new physics, as well as upgrade developments toward the silicon-based outer tracker for the CMS experiment during the High-Luminosity LHC run in the mid-2020s. This research will also engage undergraduate students in CMS data analysis and detector hardware projects at Bethel University, Fermilab, and CERN. The primary analysis goal is to search for vector-like quark (VLQ) pair production with the record-breaking CMS dataset. Several deep machine learning algorithms will be developed to identify hadronic decays of bottom quarks, top quarks, W, Z, and Higgs bosons, which are all reconstructed as jets with unique internal structure. With these deep learning techniques, VLQ pair production searches can be dramatically improved to include identification and mass reconstruction. Specifically, this work will use image recognition machine learning techniques to develop jet identification algorithms for HL-LHC studies. Additionally, extensive development will be made on design features and assembly procedures for upgraded silicon tracker modules. The Bethel CMS group will characterize silicon sensors with updates to an existing probe station and will participate in module production tests at Fermilab. The Bethel group is also engaged with several outreach and education activities, reaching high school students and the general public through tours of detector exhibits and preparing new students and collaborators for CMS analysis via an annual Data Analysis School and hands-on summer tutorials.

This program of research is centered on the CMS experiment currently running at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC)at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. This research will deepen our understanding of the Higgs boson using data from the CMS experiment to elucidate the connection between the physics of Higgs bosons and new physics beyond the Standard Model. This work will also support the upgrade of the CMS forward pixel detector for the high-luminosity LHC, with a focus on the design, selection, and testing of a read-out chip. In addition, a study will be carried out to understand the reasons why students decide to leave or remain in a physics major at UIC.<br/><br/>In the Standard Model, about one out of sixty Higgs boson events produced at the LHC is produced in association with a Z boson. Measuring this rare process will be potentially sensitive to the influence of new physics. Further, this final state can be produced by the decay of an additional, heavier Higgs boson with different symmetry properties from the observed one. Such particles are predicted by many theories and can potentially answer the question of baryogenesis. Dark matter particles may also be produced at the LHC, but their experimental signature would be ambiguous. Associated production of a Higgs boson may be a unique way to flag these interactions and discover this elusive particle. This effort will develop new experimental tools and analyses for a decay channel of the Higgs boson, and will have other applications in collider data analysis. The second aspect of this research is to upgrade the CMS forward pixel tracker, focusing on readout chips that exceed current capabilities for high bandwidth, low threshold, and radiation tolerance. The work will focus on testing prototype chips and contributing to the design of the CMS pixel readout chip, so that the new detector will be ready for construction.

Morphogenesis executes a genetically encoded developmental program, and much of the prior work has been focused on the pattern of gene expression and the molecular signals that control it. Yet because morphogenesis involves spatial rearrangement and flow of cells, physical interaction of cells within tissue plays an important role. This project will address the role of mechanical stress in coordinating cellular and sub-cellular processes with the global organization and dynamics of tissues. The proposed work will involve intra- and extramural collaborations with experimental labs, funded by other sources. As a member of the Physics Department, the PI works with physics students encouraging and guiding their research on biology problems. As a member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP), the PI coordinates the Interdisciplinary Biology Initiative that runs programs designed to break barriers between disciplines. The PI also co-directs the Santa Barbara Advanced School of Quantitative Biology (SBASQB), which holds an annual advanced Summer Research Lab course on the UCSB campus and attracts young scientists with Physics and/or Biology backgrounds from the US and around the world. <br/><br/>The PI will formulate and study a model of epithelial tissue mechanics in conjunction with quantitative analysis of experimental data for several prototypical steps of embryonic and larval development of a fruit fly. In contrast to the familiar viscoelasticity of passive materials, which are elastic at short times but flow relaxing the stress at long times, epithelial tissues can flow while remodeling at short times, yet at long times behave as a solid - an ""Active Solid"" supporting static external stress. This can be understood by invoking the activity of myosin motors and their ability to redistribute in a tension-dependent manner, which results in interesting and unusual response properties of this Active Solid state of living matter. The proposed work will apply these ideas to morphogenetic processes on large and small scales. On the large scale, the proposed work will develop a description of the global ""Morphogenetic Flow"" that rearranges tissues during gastrulation of Drosophila embryo, and aim to uncover the mechanism controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of myosin activation that defines the flow. On the smaller scale, it will model the mechanism of cell rearrangement during the larval stage of Drosophila eye development that leads to the formation of an ordered ""ommatidial crystal"" making up the fly's compound eye. The project will: 1) Develop the Active Solid Model (ASM) of epithelial tissue mechanics describing its fluid-like ability to rearrange that coexists with the ability to support steady external stress. Specifically: i) formulate a model of mechanical feedback on myosin recruitment, coupling myosin dynamics to the cytoskeletal stress and rate of strain; ii) derive a consistent continuum theory; iii) define quantitative predictions for the dynamic response to mechanical perturbations; iv) test and refine the model by comparing the predicted response with experimental data for Drosophila tissues. 2) Develop a quantitative description of global morphogenetic flow in Drosophila embryo in terms of myosin controlled continuous transformation of mechanical equilibria. The project will use the ASM framework to disentangle genetically controlled patterning of myosin activity from the effects of passive transport and mechanical feedback. Emerging hypotheses regarding relevant gene expression patterns will be tested by suitably designed experiments. 3) Develop a mechanical model to describe the observed rearrangement of cells leading to the ordered array of receptor-cells during Drosophila eye development. This project will build on the quantitative analysis of the new time-lapse imaging data, which documents the dynamics of ""ommatidial crystal"" formation with sub-cellular resolution."

They have sparked a very broad range of studies, from new tests of General Relativity and the measurement of the Hubble constant to constraints on the equation of state in neutron stars and studies of the r-process of heavy element production in the binary neutron star merger. Adding the gravitational wave signals from all such binaries in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). The above discoveries have enabled a robust estimate of this background, indicating that it is within reach of the upcoming observation runs of aLIGO and aVirgo. The SGWB may well be the next new type of gravitational-wave signal to be discovered by these detectors, with the discovery coming potentially as early as 2019.  This project aims to measure (and detect) the SGWB using data from upcoming observation runs of aLIGO and aVirgo, improving the sensitivity by up to 100x relative to the most recent results. The project will support involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research at the frontier of the nascent field of multi-messenger astrophysics, as well as activities designed to share the excitement of this new field with broader audience.<br/><br/>More specifically, using cross-correlation techniques applied to aLIGO and aVirgo data, the frequency content and temporal structure of the SGWB will be measured. Bayesian parameter estimation framework will then use this information to estimate the contributions of various astrophysical and cosmological SGWB models, as well as to identify and remove environmental contamination, such as due to the Schumann magnetic resonances. The results of this analysis are expected to place stringent constraints on the formation and evolution of compact binary systems, hence illuminating the evolution of the observed structure in the universe. Furthermore, these results will have the potential to constrain cosmological SGWB models, such as inflationary or cosmic (super)string models, and therefore probe the physics of fundamental interactions at very high energies, unachievable in laboratories. Similar cross correlation techniques will also be used to develop new searches for long transient signals, lasting from hours to days or weeks, which are expected in multiple models of neutron stars and are of particular interest for studying the remnants of binary neutron star mergers.

The best existing theory calculations for hybrid mesons predicts that 27 such mesons should exist within the mass between 1.8 and 2.5 GeV/c. GlueX has been built to study this full mass region with excellent sensitivity, using a high-intensity polarized photon beam and a state-of-the-art detector capable of identifying these new particles from the momentum distributions of their decay products. The GlueX group at University of Connecticut consists of the PI, one PhD student, and two undergraduate student researchers. This team is responsible for producing the diamond targets that generate the polarized high-energy photon beam from electrons accelerated in the Jefferson Lab accelerator, making sure they meet the stringent requirements in terms of crystal quality and flatness. The group also constructed and maintains the tagging ""microscope"" detector that is used to measure the photon beam energy. Support received under this grant enables the UConn team to travel to Newport News to support the operation of the GlueX experiment over the next three years, and to work on the analysis of GlueX data.<br/><br/>Experimental searches for hybrid mesons over the past 20 years have mostly come up empty, except for one or two outstanding candidates. One plausible reason for this is that prior searches have focused on the wrong mass region, guided by older model calculations which indicated that the masses of the lightest hybrids might be less than 1.5 GeV. Within the past decade, improved predictions have emerged, pointing to a higher mass region 1.8 - 2.5 GeV for the lightest 3 hybrid nonets. GlueX has been built to study this full mass region, with excellent mass resolution and high statistics, in photo production by polarized 9 GeV photons. During the past three years, GlueX has completed commissioning and initial physics data-taking phases. Over the next three years, the experiment will collect a major part of the full dataset required to complete its primary physics mission, and will complete an initial survey of the resonance landscape over the mass range of interest, focusing initially on a small number of exclusive final states that are favored for hybrid decays. The UConn group supports the analysis effort by authoring and maintaining the physics simulation package for GlueX, managing shared computer resources for physics simulation, and participating in the shared data analysis effort.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is successful at describing interactions of elementary particles, but it is known to be incomplete, because the SM fails to describe phenomena that shape our universe, like the difference between matter and anti-matter or the nature of dark matter. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the strong force binds three light elementary particles, quarks, to make massive composite particles, proton and neutrons, are not well understood quantitatively.  Over ninety nine percent of the mass of the visible matter in the universe is generated by the strong force in this way. In this context, the PIs are involved in two experimental programs using the electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, first to investigate the internal structure of the proton as a means of investigating the nature of the strong force, and second to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by performing precision measurements of interactions with precise Standard Model predictions. The PIs will train two graduate students and undergraduate students in carrying out the research program, and will engage in STEM outreach activities through the ""Adopt a physicist"" program. <br/><br/>This project will support in part the use of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering of electrons from the proton to produce a 3-D tomographic picture of the internal structure of the proton against which models of the strong force can be tested. Roche is one of the spoke persons for experiment E12-06-114 at JLab, and this project will support the data taking and data analysis for this experiment. The immediate goal of this experiment is to test the hypothesis of scaling on which the Generalized Parton Distribution formalism used to interpret this kind of experiments is based. The second project supported by this award will further the involvement of the PIs and their students in the JLab parity violating electron scattering experiments, QWEAK and MOLLER.  These experiments test the Standard Model by studying the electromagnetic and weak forces in electron-proton and electron-electron scattering.

However, future revolutions in physics will arise from tackling the various shortcomings of these models.  In particular, some of the greatest mysteries that remain concern the nature of dark matter, the details of early-universe cosmology, and a deep understanding of the structure of gravitation.   Professor Hertzberg's research will tackle these subjects through the formulation of theoretical models and the exploration of connections to experiment and data.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting fundamental scientific research into the nature of the universe.  Furthermore, this project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts as it will involve postdocs and engage the public in an important way through public lectures and popular articles. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Hertzberg will investigate axion dark matter in galaxies, develop novel inflationary models that probe new physics, and investigate theories of spin-two particles.  This involves the development of theoretical models that demand internal consistency and greement with data, all within the framework of effective field theory.  The primary work on the dark-matter front is to determine the clumpiness, distribution, and possible evidence for axion dark matter. The primary work on the early-universe front is to determine if reasonable inflationary models exist that improve agreement with CMB data on large scales beyond the standard scale-invariant models.   Finally, the primary objective on the gravity front is to determine if general relativity is the uniquely consistent effective theory of spin-two particles."

These arise at the boundaries of spacetime, both at infinite light like distances and near the horizon of a rapidly spinning black hole. The theoretical research has potential applications to gravitational waves, gravitational memory, upcoming astronomical observations at the Event Horizon telescope. The Event Horizon telescope is an initiative to create observations of black holes of unparalleled resolution using an array of radio antennas located across the globe. The work supported by this award will also tackle Hawking?s black hole information paradox, which posits that information may not be conserved in a black hole. In the last few years, this group has discovered an exact triangular equivalence of three phenomena which recur ubiquitously across a wide variety of physical systems and have been separately studied for over a half century: memory, soft theorems, and asymptotic symmetries. Soft theorems in quantum field theory relate any multi-particle scattering process with the insertion of a 'soft' (i.e. low-energy) particle such as a graviton to the same process without the soft particle.<br/><br/>Asymptotic symmetries (such as BMS) are diffeomorphisms which act nontrivially on the physical data at infinity. The soft theorems can be derived as the quantum matrix elements of the conservation laws associated to the asymptotic symmetries. Hence they have the same physical content. The third corner of the triangle is closed by noting that The Braginsky-Thorne formula for the gravitational memory effect is precisely the Fourier transform in time of the Weinberg soft graviton theorem. There are many recurring instances of the triangle: in QED, Yang-Mills theory, gravity, in any number of dimensions, with or without supersymmetry, with leading, subleading or subsubleading soft theorems in one corner, and quantum triangles involving anomalies. This discovery of the equivalence of previously well-understood phenomena enables us to discover brand new phenomena. Given one corner of the triangle, we now know how to find the other two. This project investigates gravitational triangles. Applied to black holes, the triangular structure was shown to imply that, far from being bald featureless objects, even classical black holes carry an infinite head of 'soft hair'. The absence of any such distinguishing features was presumed in Hawking's 1975 argument for information loss, which is therefore invalidated. This insight suggests new lines of investigation into the black hole information paradox which the group will pursue. In another direction, astronomical observation suggests the existence of near-extreme Kerr black holes whose horizons spin at nearly the speed of light. General relativity implies that the dynamics of the high-redshift, near-horizon region of extreme Kerr, which includes the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), is governed by an infinite-dimensional emergent conformal symmetry. Symmetries of physical systems in general may both usefully characterize and have striking consequences for observational data. Precision black hole spectroscopy has advanced to the stage where astronomers are beginning to observe -- with a variety of ingenious methods -- the regions of spacetime governed by this conformal symmetry. The proposed project will undertake a systematic exploration of potential observational consequences of the conformal symmetry, in particular for the Event Horizon telescope which is already in the early stages of data collection."

A broad international research program is progressing to study the properties of these particles. One aspect of this program is to investigate neutrino oscillations: one type of neutrino changing into another type. Measuring these oscillations could lead to new models of particle interaction. In order for measurements to continue to improve, understanding how the neutrino interacts with other types of matter becomes critical. This project will carry out a focused research effort with the objective to characterize neutrino interactions with matter to enhance the domestic neutrino research program. This work will also have broad impact by enhancing the ""big data"" initiative at WSU, which is a multidisciplinary effort that seeks to engage the campus, its student base, and local industry in cutting-edge data analytic techniques which are applicable in a wide range of both industrial and academic fields. <br/><br/>This work will be accomplished by analyzing neutrino interaction data from the NuMI Off-axis electron-neutrino Appearance experiment (NOvA) near detector.

This setup provides a very intense, near mono-energetic source of neutrinos, and a detector ideal for measuring a broad range of interaction types.  One of the limitations of neutrino oscillation measurement is the uncertainty in neutrino - nucleon interactions.

Are the fundamental interactions that govern the structure of matter understood? These are two of the major questions that drive the research efforts in the field of nuclear physics in years to come. The experimental push towards exotic neutron-rich nuclei has already forced us to revise our understanding of nuclear physics, and facilities like FRIB, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, will provide a wealth of new data from isotopes that could not be studied under laboratory conditions before. In these nuclei, structural changes are driven by a complex interplay of nuclear forces, the continuum, and strong many-body correlations which signal the breakdown of traditional single-reference models of nuclear structure. This has far-reaching implications, e.g., on the half lives of key nuclei for astrophysical processes, or the limits of nuclear existence, explaining why O-24 rather than O-28 is the heaviest oxygen isotope found in nature. <br/><br/>As its name suggests, the Multi-Reference In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group MR-IM-SRG) developed by the PI is a novel many-body method that can be applied to nuclei (or other many-body systems) for which single-reference based descriptions are no longer an appropriate starting point. Under the current award, the MR-IM-SRG  will be extended to the computation of excited state properties in medium-mass and heavy open-shell nuclei, including electromagnetic and weak transition rates. Using state-of-the-art interactions and currents from Chiral Effective Field Theory (EFT) the PI and his students will investigate the erosion and emergence of the so-called magic numbers, compute masses and decay rates relevant for nuclear astrophysics, and study effects like the formation of neutron skins that constrain the nuclear equation of state. The systematic improvability of the MR-IM-SRG and the inputs from Chiral EFT will allows us to control and quantify the theoretical uncertainties of these results. These efforts will help to identify potential issues in the theoretical framework through the confrontation with experimental data, and guide experimental efforts at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and FRIB, as well as other facilities worldwide. The project will provide partial support for one graduate student, who will participate in research at the forefront of nuclear physics, and receive training in high-performance computing."

As these emerge, verification techniques are necessary to ensure confidence and reliability.  The primary objective of this project is to develop new ways of uncovering errors that occur in quantum systems, while using a minimum of assumptions about those systems. For example, in quantum communication involving quantum key sharing, it is important for the communications partners to be assured that they have successfully shared a secret key, when in fact they have not. The error detection scheme at the core of this project will let them detect this error, while making a minimum of assumptions about their apparatus. The experiments will advance the movement of quantum technologies from theoretical possibility to actual implementation. These experiments will be performed by undergraduate students, preparing them for scientific careers by exposing them to emerging fields of research and new technologies.<br/><br/>Two important operations performed in experiments characterizing quantum systems are (i) preparing systems in particular states and then (ii) performing measurements on those states. State preparation and measurement are usually independent, uncorrelated operations, and when analyzing data it is usually assumed that this is the case. However, if there are indeed correlations between the state preparations and the measurements, it is possible to draw erroneous conclusions from measured data. The primary objective of this project is to experimentally demonstrate a technique called loop state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) tomography, which is capable of detecting such correlated errors while making a minimum of assumptions. No assumptions need to be made about either the state preparation or the measurements, other than that the experimenter knows the Hilbert space dimension of the system they are working with. Experiments will be performed on one- and two-qubit systems, with the qubits encoded in the polarizations of individual photons. The group proposes to demonstrate that loop SPAM tomography is capable of detecting correlations between state preparations and measurements of single qubits. They also propose to detect nonlocal correlations between measurements of two qubits in which one party is attempting to fake a Bell inequality violation."

It has had great success in dealing with the inanimate world: we can now predict in quantitative detail what the most sensitive experiments will observe inside the nucleus and in the cosmos at large. By contrast, even as our ability to observe and measure improves dramatically, the phenomena of life remain largely unpredictable, even in their most qualitative aspects. In this project, a group of theoretical physicists will engage with students and postdoctoral scholars in an effort to close this gap; in short, to construct a theoretical physics of biological systems. The proponents have explored phenomena that span the tree of life: from metabolism in bacteria, through the determination of cell fate in embryonic development, to coding and computation of sensory information in brain. They have identified broad theoretical problems which cut across the traditional biological divisions of organism and system: Do living organisms operate near the limits set by the laws of physics as they gather and process information? Can we learn the detailed microscopic ""model"" of an organism, its ""wiring diagram"", from the finite set of observations we can make on how it behaves? How do organisms set the parameters that govern their function (i.e. how do they learn from experience)? These questions can all be given a mathematical form which guides a search for answers in terms of general principles, in the tradition of physics that will apply across disparate biological domains. The time is right to bring the beautiful phenomena of life under the powerful predictive umbrella of theoretical physics. Just as cosmology has progressed, in roughly one generation, from wild speculation to a precise framework for analyzing a rapidly expanding set of observations, the proponents believe that the intimate interaction between theory and experiment can lead to a new and deeper physics of biological systems. It is the creation of this scientific culture, where theory and experiment are equal partners in the exploration of life that is the fundamental intellectual merit of the project. It is not just the boundaries of academic disciplines, but our view of ourselves, which is at stake. A very important aspect of this project will be the training of a new generation of physicists for whom the development of a theoretical understanding of biological systems is a central part of their discipline. The graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who pass through the group will learn by example how to pursue that goal in a way consistent with the intellectual rigor and traditions of physics. They will eventually move on to faculty positions of their own, where they will transmit this attitude to new generations of students. More broadly, all project personnel are deeply engaged with new educational initiatives, addressing levels from the first year of college to advanced PhD students, which provide a more complete guide to the evolving, multidisciplinary intellectual landscape.<br/><br/>The participants in the project will assemble into subgroups to attack instances of these problems. The individual projects will have unusual scope: as an example, the question whether we can capture the complex statistics of biological behavior in a learnable mathematical model can be asked in very similar terms both of spiking retinal neurons, and of the antibody sequence repertoire of individual zebrafish. If the answer is yes and the models have similar mathematical structure, one will have learned something novel and deep about what makes evolved, living, systems different from the inanimate world. Since these questions can only be answered in the light of accurate data, the work will involve a close partnership with many experimental groups in fields ranging from bacteriology to human perceptual psychology. The product of these interactions will be the design of novel experiments and the creation of novel data analysis methods in order to address clearly formulated mathematical questions of broad significance. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics, the Cellular Cluster and the Systems and Synthetic Biology in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

This was apparent as early as the nineteenth century from the extensive interconnectivity of nearby neurons and continues to be apparent from numerous measurements of the tuning curves and correlation of nearby neurons. Despite its fundamental importance, population neural codes are poorly understood. In this project, the PI will combine large-scale neural recording methods with state-of-the-art theoretical analyses to study collective phenomena in population neural codes. The project will focus on the retina as a model system, where the quality and completeness of experimental data is the greatest. The project will give us a thorough and clear understanding of what are the ""ingredients"" needed at the population level to give rise to criticality, which will be important in generating hypotheses about what other regions of the brain might exhibit criticality in their population codes. It will also explore a novel hypothesis about how critical population states give rise to a discrete aspect of the neural code and one that is highly robust to neural noise. This could give us new insight into how we effortlessly divide the sensory world into objects.  <br/><br/>The PI has an extensive track record in multi-electrode recording from the vertebrate retina, along with applying maximum entropy models to analyze states of network activity. The PI hypothesizes that the retinal population code has an unusual and nontrivial structure that it analogous to the critical state in physical systems. This structure leads to the definition of a ""collective mode"" of neural activity, which is a set of neural activity states that groups visual stimuli into discrete classes. These collective modes constitute a novel hypothesis about population neural codes that is qualitatively different from the view of information encoding at the single-neuron level. The proposed projects aims are: understanding the origin of criticality, including studying the role of correlations in the stimulus, using adaptation to test how specifically retinal circuitry is tuned to give rise to criticality, studying the pattern and strength of correlation required for any network to give rise to criticality as well as formulating receptive field models to see what degrees of overlap and functional heterogeneity are required in defining collective modes of neural activity and studying what stimuli they encode and how reliably they are activated by a given visual stimulus. The broader impacts of the proposed work lie along three distinct directions:(i) the potential to develop new concepts about population neural codes that could prove applicable across many different brain regions; (ii) the development and dissemination of software to perform maximum entropy fits to neural data, which could help spur on the research programs of many labs that use these methods to analyze neural populations; (iii) the broadening of our ideas about critical systems in physics to include the kind of asymmetric, intermediate cases found in biology.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

The proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. During the period of this grant, we will perform data analysis leading to the final determination of the proton's weak charge from the Qweak experiment.  We will also perform analysis to extract physics results from the Qweak data for two other topics - a probe of hadronic parity violation in the N to Delta transition and a measurement of the transverse asymmetry in Moller scattering.<br/> <br/>The MOLLER experiment is an approved TJNAF experiment intended for the upgraded 12 GeV TJNAF.  It will measure the electron's neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at a very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders.  It would have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios.  During the period of this grant, our group will contribute to the development of this experiment by working on beam charge and position monitor upgrades, luminosity monitor and background detector development and construction, and simulation design studies."

A primary goal of this project is to provide theoretical data for systems and processes where reliable experimental data are either limited, or not currently available, thereby filling ?knowledge gaps? that sometimes hinder the modeling of astrophysical or other environments. This is particularly important for processes in which molecules are either formed, or destroyed, as these are important in many applications, including astrophysical models of photodissociation regions, protoplanetary disks of young stellar objects, collisions within ultracold gases, and in searches for better and less expensive catalytic materials for hydrogen storage. The project is designed to integrate research, teaching, and educational outreach and to provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to begin training for STEM careers.<br/><br/>A novel approach for calculating formation and destruction rate constants will be employed which ensures detailed balance and self-consistency with the steady-state solution of an underlying master equation for any combination of kinetic and radiation temperature and gas density. This approach is expected to provide a substantial improvement over conventional kinetic models such as orbiting resonance theory, which are currently in wide use. Applied aspects which aim to push existing methodologies in quantum collision theory will be pursued. Dynamical de-coupling approximations will be studied and benchmarked against numerically exact results obtained from full-dimensional close-coupling calculations for collisions involving two diatomic molecules. Large databases of collisional and radiative rate coefficients will be developed in order to improve and extend the predictive capabilities for non-equilibrium systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been thought that truly extreme objects such as black holes and neutron stars are responsible.  Advanced instruments spanning the electromagnetic spectrum have provided a wealth of information regarding the transient Universe; however, many observations are unable to directly probe the dynamics of the systems in question.  General relativity provides a way to map out the dynamics of massive, dense objects from a distance by encoding the motion as ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves.  The principal investigator of this project will lead an effort within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to detect transient gravitational waves from the merger of black holes and neutron stars in real-time, enabling prompt multi-wavelength follow-up observations that can shed new light onto the origin of transients. Discoveries will be relayed to a network of follow-up observatories so that scientists can learn as much as possible about these events before they fade away.  This research will increase understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time and the properties of exotic states of matter and energy that are not accessible to Earth-based laboratories.<br/><br/>The LIGO Collaboration has built highly sensitive laser interferometric gravitational wave receivers in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA that will measure to extra-galactic distances the minute oscillations of space-time caused by, for example, the merger of two neutron stars.  Data from these observatories will be streamed in real-time to supercomputing facilities across the U.S where thousands of computing nodes will integrate millions of unique physical models of black hole and neutron star systems, known as templates, with the data in real time.  Advanced signal processing techniques and software co-developed by the PI will infer the presence of a signal from any of the models within seconds of the signal arriving at Earth.  Requiring signals to be observed simultaneously in multiple geographically separated gravitational wave detectors will allow the position of the source to be localized as well as provide confidence that the signal is not of terrestrial origin.  The best-fit parameters and estimate of the event significance will be ingested into the gravitational-wave candidate event database where alerts to external partners will be issued as well as real-time correlation with external triggers such as gamma-ray bursts through the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN)."

Our understanding of the nucleon as an interacting system of yet more fundamental particles, quarks and gluons, collectively called partons, is based on the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD). Partons are both confined and moving inside of the nucleon. The exploration of the nucleon structure that incorporates the motion of partons will allow us to gain new information on the three dimensional (3D) structure of the nucleon.  Knowing how the constituent parts combine together is essential to understanding the properties of the nucleon that we observe.   The PI will work towards an improved phenomenological description of the 3D structure of the nucleon and will develop a web interface server based at PSU Berks to make the results available to researchers and the general public. Undergraduate students will be trained and supported by this project.<br/> <br/>The scientific goals of the project are to extract precisely the Transverse Momentum Dependent distribution and fragmentation functions (TMDs) that describe the 3D nucleon structure, from the existing experimental data. TMDs are intimately related to the correlations of parton motion and the spin of the parton and /or the spin of the nucleon and generate Spin Asymmetries in scattering processes. The project is intended to unify existing formalisms of the description of the 3D nucleon structure, and ultimately explore the origin of the Spin Asymmetries in various processes. The data from past and existing facilities, such as HERMES (DESY), COMPASS (CERN), and Jefferson Lab, BELLE (KEK), BaBar (SLAC), BESIII (Beijing), RHIC (BNL), LHC (CERN), will be used in the studies. The results of the project will help with planning future experiments at Jefferson Lab 12, and a future Electron Ion Collider. The project will also lead to the extraction of fundamental charges of the nucleon, in particular, the nucleon's tensor charge, which is important for searches of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics and complements efforts of its calculation in Lattice QCD."

Observations by astronomers of the motions of stars and gas near supermassive black holes, such as the one at the center of the Milky Way, have opened the possibility of testing Einstein's theory in realms where the warping of spacetime is extreme.   Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The solutions developed in this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how the warped spacetime near massive black holes affects stars orbiting such objects.  Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as scalar-tensor gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.  The approach extends a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations that has been developed over many years by the PI and his collaborators.  The possibility of testing general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future infrared telescopes, proposed by the PI in 2008, will be investigated further.  The effects of general relativity on the structure and long-term evolution of clusters of stars around massive black holes will be studied using analytic means based on the post-Newtonian approximation."

These explosions are revealed in solar and stellar flares, flares in astrophysical objects, storms in Earth's space environment and disruptions in laboratory fusion experiments. Magnetic energy release is also the driver of space weather, which can negatively impact satellite communications and threaten astronauts in space.  Magnetic reconnection is the fundamental process that describes how magnetic fields annihilate. Great progress has been made on understanding the mechanisms for the fast release of magnetic energy seen in nature and the laboratory.

A novel computational model will be implemented to explore particle acceleration in macro-scale systems that can be used to predict the spectra and photon and radio signatures of energetic particles in astrophysical plasmas.

An on-going puzzle is that the proton size appears to be different when measured with atomic hydrogen as compared with its counterpart, called muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in a hydrogen atom is replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. This project will specifically build equipment to be used in an experiment to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius.

MUSE will determine the proton radius through both muon-proton scattering and electron-proton scattering, in addition to performing these reactions with positive and negative leptons. This not only reduces systematic uncertainties but also provides sensitivity to two-photon exchange contributions that may be responsible for some of the discrepancies seen in earlier experiments.

This measurement disagreed with, but was much more precise than, all the other proton size measurements to date. The research supported by this award aims to resolve this issue, known as the ""Proton Radius Puzzle"" by making a simultaneous measurement of muon and electron scattering on the proton in the Muon Proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE). In addition to determining the proton size, the group will spend a small amount of its time investigating the internal structures and dynamics of the proton and neutron, by measuring quantities known as the polarizabilities. These measurements will be made by scattering light from protons and neutrons. Experiments will take place at laboratories in Switzerland, Germany and the US.  Through these experiments, in addition to gaining knowledge about protons and neutrons, the postdoctoral researchers, undergraduate, and graduate students will gain knowledge and experience of modern detection techniques, and simulation and reconstruction software, which are employed in many applications such as industrial or medical imaging.

Yet the connection between simulation data and the physical world represents a major conceptual problem. In this context, this project will develop and apply theoretical and computational methods intended to support the experimental program at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and close the gap between observed phenomena and their explanation from first principles.

One can measure just how violent a collision is by comparing the energy of the crashing high-speed ions with the electrical force between them. The most violent ion collisions, the ones that are most important both for extending our scientific knowledge and for developing technological applications, are very difficult to measure or calculate. They occur in extremely hot and very dense gases of charged particles called plasmas. In this project, new ideas will be used to measure and understand these collisions. Lasers will be used to slow atoms from speeds of nearly 1000 meters per second to a crawl of about an inch per second; and then to turn these slow atoms into ions. Additional lasers will then be used to measure how these ions crash into each other. The ions in these slow-motion collisions have the same amount of crash energy compared to the ion-ion electrical force, which means that the collision results can be directly compared to similar collisions at any energy. This project will use state-of-the-art large-scale computer simulations to make movies of the ion-ion collisions and compare these to the experimental measurements. When the computations are proven to be sufficiently accurate, approximations will be gradually introduced and tested in order to speed up the computations. These results will then set the standard for accurate and fast computations of ion collisions in plasmas. Several students will work on this project: Undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scientists will work closely with expert scientists at Willamette University (Oregon), Brigham Young University (Utah), and the New Mexico Consortium (New Mexico).<br/><br/>The proposed collaborative research project will investigate energy relaxation in a system in which the value of the Coulomb logarithm is small. This is typical of high-energy-density systems, where violent small-impact-parameter collisions result in large particle deflections. Understanding these collisions is a priority for advancing fundamental plasma physics and for accurately modeling small impact parameter collisions in high energy density plasmas. The proposed work will generate high quality data in plasma regimes where traditional diagnostics are limited. The proposed work will combine data from a new dual-species ultracold neutral plasma experiment and state-of-the-art simulations to study temperature equilibration in moderately coupled plasmas, in which classic plasma assumptions are invalid. The dual-species plasma will be generated by resonantly photo-ionizing laser-cooled Yb and Ca atoms in the same magneto-optical trap. Laser-induced fluorescence measurements will be used to measure the time-evolving ion velocity distribution for each ion species simultaneously. By delaying the ionization of one species relative to the other, the time scale for full energy relaxation can be determined. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations will be performed that match the density, stoichiometry, and geometry of the experiments. The calculations will provide a first-principles description of collision processes by directly integrating many-body trajectories. Arbitrarily complicated orbits will be computed self-consistently with dynamical many-body screening. The many-body phase dynamics will be inverted to yield highly accurate effective Coulomb logarithms, providing important information back to the high energy density community.

The advancement of accelerator technology relies on a deep and detailed understanding of the behavior of the particle beam inside the accelerator. Sophisticated simulation codes have been developed to model the particle beams in the accelerator in order to aid in understanding particle beam behavior in current accelerators, and in the design of future accelerators. To produce accurate results, the simulations require an initial description of the beam that is beyond what has yet been experimentally measured.  The deficit of knowledge in this area places a fundamental limitation on progress toward understanding the beam behavior in accelerators, particularly in high power accelerators. The main difficulty in acquiring this information is the extensive time associated with performing the experimental measurement, which renders it impractical or impossible for operational accelerators, and the necessity for developing the novel diagnostics device capable of performing the full multi-parameter measurement.  In this project, the University of Tennessee will make use of the Integrated Test Stand Facility (ITSF) at the Spallation Neutron Source accelerator in order to perform the first comprehensive measurement of the initial beam properties.  The ITSF is a duplicate of the first piece of the SNS accelerator, and therefore provides a realistic platform for this measurement but without the time limitations associated with operational accelerators. This project will fund one postdoc, one graduate student, and a few undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee to design and implement the necessary equipment on the ITSF to perform the measurement, under guidance from staff at UT and at SNS. The project will enable these young scientists to gain hands-on experience in hardware design and data analysis, while also making an important scientific contribution. Almost all accelerators, from high-energy particle physics machines to future accelerators for transmutation of nuclear waste and energy production, will benefit from the results of this work.<br/><br/>For any linear accelerator, the quality of the beam in the front end limits what can be achieved downstream; a poor quality beam early on results in unwanted emittance growth and beam halo. One of the holy grails of accelerator physics is quantitative modeling of the onset and evolution of beam halo and it?s translation into beam loss during acceleration. Unfortunately, there is a recurring failure of state-of-the art simulation codes to successfully benchmark anything beyond RMS quantities of the beam. Since it is the extended beam tails that cause beam loss in an accelerator, this is a performance-limiting issue. The consensus in the community is that the problem is not a failure of the codes, but rather a deficit in knowledge of the initial beam distribution. To date, there has never been a full 6D measurement of the beam phase space exiting the front-end radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ).  The thrust of the work is a modest expansion of the diagnostics to enable the first full 6D measurements of the beam phase space, and small modifications to allow subsequent measurements of the downstream evolution of beam. A final goal is to optimize the diagnostics schemes in operational accelerators to improve the ability to reconstruct initial beam phase space distributions. The extended ITFS will serve as a community-wide resource for understanding halo formation and improving measurement and modeling techniques; interested colleagues will be given the data and invited to perform their own experiments."

These processes can be understood by the theory of quantum mechanics. The present experimental project involves setting up controlled collisions between a well-defined beam of electrons and gas atoms or molecules placed in their path. The aim is to carefully investigate how these electrons are deflected by the target gas atoms or molecules and how they change the physical and chemical state of these targets for a given energy of the electrons. The experiments are conducted for a wide range of electron energies and will look at the dynamic interaction between the electrons and the targets and delve into the physics which controls how the electrons are scattered in various directions at these controlled energies. The targets include simple atoms such as neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, molecular hydrogen and nitrogen, and more complex molecules such as water, alcohols and benzene-type aromatic molecules. The experimental results are used to test detailed quantum scattering models to promote our understanding of the interaction of these electrons with targets. The project continues prior work in the same lab which has advanced the modeling of industrial processes. A benefit from this project will be the exposure of undergraduates to world-wide PhD programs as a result of their engagement in this project.<br/><br/>A new electron time-of-flight spectrometer will be able to handle very slow electrons emerging from scattering events.  The electron beam is pulsed and the scattered electrons are separated in velocity by the amount of time they take to reach the detector. The scattering of low energy electrons with kinetic energies ranging from 0.5 eV to 100 eV is studied using electron energy loss spectroscopy where the incident energy of a 1 mm collimated beam of high energy resolution crosses a tenuous beam of pure atoms or molecules in a vacuum chamber. The energy separation of electrons (produced from a tungsten filament source) is made at high resolution (30-50 meV full-with at half maximum) using electrostatic lenses combined with hemispherical analyzers. The measurements consist of differential scattering cross sections and polarization correlations for electron scattering from rare gas atoms and simple diatomic molecules (H2 and N2). The data provide tests for models of electron scattering and shed light on the quantum dynamics of the scattering process which involves details of Coulomb interactions, electron spin processes (spin-exchange, spin-orbit), and resonant interactions. Models to date have been evolving to handle more complex targets as computational power is rapidly increasing. The present project will look at the polarization of emitted vacuum ultraviolet radiation and, perpendicular to the scattering plane, in coincidence with differentially scattered electrons whose energy loss coincides with the excitation energy of the radiation. Importantly, it will measure the circular polarization of the radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet, a parameter which is related to the angular momentum imparted to the target by the scattered electron, and provides valuable physical insights to the collision process. In addition, the development of a new time-of-flight spectrometer (using a fast 1 nanosecond pulsed electron beam) will enable absolute calibration of scattering cross sections as well as be able to handle slow emergent electrons in the energy range of 0.5eV to 20eV, and add to the range and accuracy of the overall ongoing measurements. This project aims to continue its productive supply of accurate collision data involving undergraduates in laboratory research."

Possible approaches include the study of physics processes at the highest available collision energies at accelerators or through studies of the very rare interactions of neutrinos. The Columbia Particle Physics group is engaged in both approaches, which are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. <br/><br/>At the highest available collision energies, the objectives of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the recently discovered Higgs Boson, and to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The next three years will witness the growth of the LHC physics program through ever higher interaction rates and ever increasing data sets at collision energies of 13-14 TeV. <br/><br/>The Columbia team is one of the leading groups participating in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Their contributions include extensive involvement in the scientific and technical management of the experiment, substantial contributions to the maintenance and operations and upgrades of the key detectors for energy measurement, in particular the Liquid Argon Calorimetry. In the search for new physics, the group is focusing on searches for evidence of supersymmetry and for exotic particles of very high masses in a broad range of production and decay processes, involving vector bosons and the Higgs boson, and relying on the recognition of charged leptons, jets and missing energy.<br/><br/>Another major question is what happened to all the antimatter in the universe. Fundamental symmetry arguments suggest that matter and antimatter should have been produced in equal abundance in the early universe, but now all we see is matter. A key to unraveling this mystery may lie with elusive particles called neutrinos, which are abundant in the universe, but which barely interact with matter. There are three of these particles known. Why three? And what are the masses of these particles? Are there more? Experiments are underway to understand these phenomena and to see if more than three neutrinos exist.<br/><br/>The Columbia group is involved with the experiment MicroBooNE, which is now online at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, and a new detector in preparation, called SBND. This program will address several of the key questions in neutrino physics, including the search of additional neutrinos as well as advancement of an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber. The Columbia group has major responsibilities for the readout electronics of the Time Projection Chamber and triggering system, detector simulation, data acquisition software, and physics analysis for MicroBooNE, and is advancing these efforts to the future Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A principal focus of the Columbia group over many years and strengthened with this award is the training of undergraduate students through their highly successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program. This program has demonstrated a commitment to the inclusion of under-represented groups, including many students from undergraduate-only institutions.  And follow-up tracking has shown an impressive rate of success for graduates of their programs to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields."

To improve upon this analogy, one must understand how electrons in atoms repel each other due to their negative charges, and how electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics.   This project studies how interactions between electrons causes their motion to become correlated. This is important because such correlations have a big impact on the physical and chemical properties of atoms, molecules, and materials.  To investigate electron correlations, this project will observe situations in which two electrons are transferred from one atom to an ion and an x-ray photon is simultaneously emitted.  When this happens, the entire process can be thought of as the time inverse of double ionization (removal of two electrons) by a single photon. This is related to the photoelectric effect, which was originally explained by Albert Einstein in 1905.  However, the rate for double photoionization is difficult to predict because of the way electrons interact with one another.  Similar physics is important when two electrons are transferred to a moving projectile. Scientists are interested in understanding this process as it occurs in collisions between projectile ions and target atoms and from the time-reversed process of double photoionization of an atom by a single photon. Both processes are likely to occur in astrophysical plasmas. Probabilities for the two-electron process have been calculated with widely differing results, leaving the field open for experiments to resolve the differences. Attempts to measure the process have been very difficult due to the long measuring times required to observe the events. The involvement of Ph.D. students in this research project gives them valuable training in a state-of-the-art physics experiment and experience in preparing collaborative manuscripts and abstracts and allows them to attend conferences to report the results and assists them as they develop into productive young scientists.<br/><br/>The transfer of two electrons to an ion accompanied by the emission of a single photon is called radiative-double-electron capture, or RDEC for short. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in its intrinsic importance in the field of ion collisions with quasi-free electrons, and its close relationship to photon interactions with highly-charged ions. This relationship comes about because RDEC is the time inverse of double photoionization. These processes are essentially identical when RDEC occurs for incident fully-stripped ions and double photoionization for two-electron systems, in which case the interaction between the two electrons, i.e., correlation, plays a fundamental role. RDEC is similar to the commonly observed one-electron process of radiative-electron capture (REC), the inverse of the photoelectric effect, which, however, does not require electron correlation. New studies in this project of RDEC for gas targets of helium, nitrogen and neon will address complications of previously published data involving ion-solid interactions for oxygen and fluorine ions incident on a thin C-foil target. Multiple collision effects are not present for gas targets as they are for solid targets. RDEC can be compared with several published theoretical calculations, which, however, differ by several orders of magnitude. The measurements are being done (Some preliminary data have already been obtained for nitrogen and neon targets.) for fully-stripped fluorine ions using the 6-MV tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Western Michigan University. Coincidences between x rays emitted and singly- and doubly-charged projectiles are recorded, with the latter representing a signature for RDEC. The measurements are very time-consuming due to the relatively small RDEC cross sections (less than ~1 barn) and require continuous counting times of a month or more for each target. The studies are carried out by the PI, the co-PI, and two graduate students and also include collaborators from the University of Notre Dame and Jagiellonian University in Krakow (Poland)."

This is because the pressure that pushes neutrons across the nucleus to form a thick neutron skin is the same pressure which supports a neutron star collapsing against the pull of gravity. Furthermore, at boundaries between the liquid core and solid crust of a neutron star, quantities such as the transition density and the pressure depend on the properties of the neutron rich matter.   The collaborative environment supported by this award will enable recruitment and retention of African American students to STEM education by providing opportunities in mentored research experiences. The skills acquired during the training will prepare these students for advanced degrees and experience appropriate for careers to mitigate the scarcity of underrepresented minorities in national laboratory STEM professions and will contribute positively to the production of an overall diverse and competitive scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Recent theoretical studies show that resonance parameters can be used to establish the necessary constraints on symmetry-energy terms in the Equation of State (EoS).  One of the big challenges is relating properties of the EoS to nuclear observables. Promising nuclear observables include the measurement of neutron-skin thickness and properties of nuclear excitations arising from collective motion of protons and neutrons, for example, the Isovector Giant Quadrupole Resonance (IVGQR). The IVGQR is a collective mode of the nucleus characterized by the out-of-phase oscillation of protons against neutrons. The restoring force is due to the symmetry energy term which appears in the nuclear EoS. Therefore, the systematic determination of the IVGQR parameters supported by this award will provide important constraints on the symmetry energy term in the EoS.  The supported activities will produce polarization asymmetry data with uncertainties of 1% or better for the Sn-112 and Sn-114 isotopes. These data will allow extraction of the mass dependencies of the IVGQR energy, the resonance width, and the depletion of the energy-weighted sum rule with uncertainties considerably lower than any previous measurement. These resonance parameters will improve theoretical models with further constraints on the symmetry energy in the equation of state for neutron rich matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the LHC's primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for much of the interactions of particles forming the visible matter in the universe.  Though doubts linger, many physicists believe the new particle is the Higgs Boson long predicted by the SM.  Nevertheless, more careful measurements of its rarer decay modes need to be made.  Surprises are possible, and could result from effects beyond the SM that are yet to be discovered.  This project will focus on efforts to do this by looking at events that pair a Higgs boson with another particle.  Searches for extremely rare processes as will be sought in this effort require the use of sophisticated software and computing tools, modern machine learning techniques, data mining and the use of complex statistical tool kits. These skills are useful not only in particle physics and other STEM fields, but also outside of academia and the research world as companies, non-profits and governmental organizations across the country look to the large data sets newly available from social media and computing databases to provide better products and more useful services to customers and<br/>citizens.<br/><br/>The proposal supports work to be done in Run2.

Since its inception in the mid-1970s, the Standard Model of Particle Physics has been successful at describing a wide range of physical phenomena in nuclear and high energy physics, at accelerator laboratories and in table-top experiments. There are, however, compelling theoretical reasons to expect the Standard Model to break down, as well as some experimental hints in precision measurements. It is therefore widely believed that the Standard Model is simply an approximate low-energy description, arising from more fundamental physics that is manifest at energies that are currently beyond experimental reach. Precision measurements present a powerful approach to test the Standard Model of particle physics at low-energy electron accelerators. The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia, is currently the world's leading laboratory for a subclass of these precision measurement tests of the Standard Model. This project supports precision measurements of the weak charge of the proton and of the electron in two large collaborative experiments at Jefferson Lab. In analogy to the electric charge, the weak charge describes how strongly these particles interact through the weak nuclear force. The results of both experiments, by themselves but also in combination with the results from the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), will allow us to constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model. The investigators are working to increase economic and ethnic diversity in physics through specific recruiting and outreach efforts. One of the investigators has been active in improving gender diversity in physics through a national APS-affiliated organization, and is also developing a novel curricular track in Engineering Physics and Applied Design at William & Mary, which has a goal of attracting and improving retention of women and students of color to the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The electroweak-mixing angle, a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, can be extracted at nuclear energies from measurements of the weak charge of the proton or of the electron. The mixing angle runs with energy scale in the Standard Model, and comparison of the measured value with the predicted running allows a sensitive search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The weak charges are accessed using parity-violating electron scattering in the Qweak experiment (for the proton) and the MOLLER experiment (for the electron). The Qweak experiment has taken data and the signature publication is currently in preparation. This will constitute the first precision measurement of the proton's weak charge. After publication of the main result, the experiment will finalize more than a dozen ancillary results. The investigators will continue their central role in the simulation and data analysis efforts crucial to the analysis of the backgrounds from electron-aluminum scattering and the polarization sensitivity of the main detectors. The MOLLER experiment is currently in the design stages and will use parity-violating electron-electron scattering to extract the electroweak mixing angle to a precision comparable to the best available high-energy measurements, through a measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The investigators will take a leading role in the development and testing of the track reconstruction detectors for the MOLLER experiment, and are also responsible for a detection system to measure the background from electro- and photo-produced pions."

Exploring the QGP enhances our understanding of the nuclear force and sheds light on the workings of the young universe. The properties of the QGP are studied by measuring the characteristics of the particles produced in the collisions using detectors that are at large and complex experiments like PHENIX. This award will support a project that uses data collected by PHENIX to investigate how some of the signals of particles coming out of the collisions are correlated with each other. In addition to the analysis of PHENIX data, this project will work on the instrumentation development and testing of detector components for an upgrade planned for the PHENIX detector called sPHENIX. This detector that will make precise measurements that will enhance further our understanding of the inner workings of the QGP.  <br/> <br/>This project will measure direct photon-hadron correlations in heavy ion collisions recorded by PHENIX. Photon-hadron correlations have long been considered a ""golden channel"" for studying jets in the QGP. Since the photon does not interact via the strong force, it escapes the QGP unmodified and therefore can be used to estimate the initial momentum of the opposing jet. Analyzing the newer larger PHENIX datasets will enable more differential measurements than previously achieved, which will give access to the transport coefficients of the QGP. In addition to the PHENIX analysis, an effort is provided for developing and testing the hadronic calorimeter for sPHENIX where photon-jet correlations will be accessible in addition to other jet substructure observables. Such measurements are crucial for developing a complete understanding of the QGP and the strong force."

This force is responsible for binding elementary particles, called quarks, into protons and neutrons, and the latter into atomic nuclei.  Under normal conditions in our everyday world quarks are always bound into composite objects and isolated quarks are never observed.  However, when strongly interacting matter is heated to extreme temperatures (a million times the temperature in the core of the sun and above) a novel phase of matter, called a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), appears where composite objects melt and quarks become the deconfined fundamental degrees of freedom. The PI will perform a first-principle study of how composite states of heavy quarks, referred to as heavy quarkonia, behave in a QGP. Theoretical knowledge of their properties and melting patterns provides information about QGP and allows us to study the microscopy of QGP, the nature of quark confinement and the strong force in general. The investigations in this project are of great relevance for explaining the findings of the experimental program of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, performed at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research.<br/><br/>This project seeks to carry out first-principle, parameter-free predictions of heavy quarkonia spectral functions that encode all information about the quarkonia states, from the fundamental QCD Lagrangian. The PI will develop novel theoretical and computational methods for performing Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory computations with anisotropic Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (aHISQ) action. The heavy quarks will be included in the framework of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD). The PI will also develop Bayesian inference techniques for solving the inverse problem that arises when reconstructing the spectral functions from the lattice QCD data. These new methods will be explored, tested with the available lattice data, and implemented in an open-source codebase. The main goal is to achieve predictive results on the spectral functions with fully assessed statistical and systematic uncertainties. The PI will mentor doctorate students involved in the research as well as engage in public outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the most fundamental level, nuclei are composed of quarks held together by the exchange of gluons. The grouping of quarks into baryons and mesons provides the ingredients for our understanding of nuclei as being composed of protons and neutrons held together by the exchange of mesons. The stable isotopes provide about 250 different combinations of protons and neutrons. About 3,000 more combinations have been made in the laboratory, and many more, in particular those with a large excess of neutrons, will be made and studied at the next generation of facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. Up to 7,000 different combinations of protons and neutrons were involved in the formation of the elements during the evolution of the universe. This project in nuclear structure theory will provide analytical models and computational tools for understanding the properties of these nuclei. The results of these studies will be applied to areas of fundamental physics and nuclear astrophysics where the nuclear properties are needed.<br/><br/>This project will greatly expand the use of of Configuration Interaction (CI) and Energy Density Functional (EDF) models for nuclei. This will carried out on several levels. The PI will develop new Hamiltonians used for these methods with input from ab-initio models based on nucleon-nucleon scattering data together with empirical constraints from known experimental data. The PI will develop computational methods that allow for the solution of the quantum many-body problem that take into account the very large basis dimensions needed in the CI method. The PI will make applications of these results to many areas of physics interest. They will be  used for collaborations with the experimental program at FRIB and other laboratories. They will be used to obtain nuclear matrix elements for studying fundamental physics with nuclei. They also will be used in collaboration with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics and Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE) at MSU to calculate reaction rates needed for understanding supernovae and X-ray bursters, and for the nuclear equations of state needed for neutron stars and neutron star mergers.

The rate and accuracy of these detections will improve as LIGO is upgraded. By comparing the detected waves with detailed predictions of the waves, scientists can measure properties (locations, masses, spins) of the black holes and learn about how they might have formed and how they warp space and time as they collide.  The predictions are made using the equations of General Relativity, written down by Einstein in 1915 but unsolvable (for colliding black holes) until about 2005 with the development of advanced methods and powerful supercomputers. This project supports theoretical work designed to underpin and improve LIGO's ability to extract from observed GWs the rich information that the waves carry.  This includes the improvement and use of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), currently the most accurate computer code for solving Einstein's equations for black hole binaries. SpEC will be used to carry out numerical solutions of black-hole collisions for the purpose of analyzing LIGO data.  In addition, a new computer code SpECTRE will be developed; this is a next-generation upgrade of SpEC designed for new upcoming computer architectures and accuracies beyond those of current codes. SpECTRE will be used to predict gravitational waveforms from two colliding neutron stars and from a black hole colliding with a neutron star.  Gravitational waves from neutron-star collisions are expected to be observed by LIGO, and can teach scientists about how matter behaves at ultra-high densities.  This program will also serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists. The new code SpECTRE and its output will be publicly released.  Group members will reach out to the general public through lectures, interactive web pages, and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>By combining analytical techniques and numerical simulations with SpEC: (i) Gravitational-wave signals for black-hole binaries will be generated for use in LIGO data analysis, will be used to calibrate analytic models, and will be used to produce numerical surrogate models that can evaluate a single waveform in milliseconds while retaining the accuracy of full numerical simulations; and (ii) the dynamical behavior of highly curved spacetime will be explored via analytic, perturbative, and numerical approaches. The next-generation open-source code SpECTRE will be developed for numerical relativity simulations with matter and radiation. SpECTRE uses Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. It is designed for high accuracy and high scalability on current and future supercomputers by following a novel task-based parallelization paradigm. SpECTRE's initial version already implements general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. It will be upgraded to handle the dynamical space  times of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, including nuclear-theory based hot equations of state and neutrinos. SpECTRE will be applied to studies of BH and accretion disk formation to understand dynamics and GW emission.

An on-going puzzle is that the proton size appears to be different when measured with atomic hydrogen as compared with its counterpart, called muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in a hydrogen atom is replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. This project will specifically build equipment to be used in an experiment to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The seven standard deviation discrepancy between the proton radius measured with muonic hydrogen and with electron-proton scattering may point to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, or result from novel aspects of conventional physics or from issues in extracting the radius from experimental data. The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) aims to resolve the proton radius puzzle. MUSE uses a mixed pion, muon and electron beam at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. MUSE will determine the proton radius through both muon-proton scattering and electron-proton scattering, in addition to performing these reactions with positive and negative leptons. This not only reduces systematic uncertainties but also provides sensitivity to two-photon exchange contributions that may be responsible for some of the discrepancies seen in earlier experiments. This collaborative project supports the construction of MUSE over the period September 2016 - August 2018.

The theory of gravity developed by Newton is not sufficient to describe the extreme densities in the CCSN mechanism. As such, CCSN represent an excellent test bed for Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will advance the description of gravity in current CCSN models, from an essentially Newtonian description with a simple correction accounting for some Einsteinian effects to a far more sophisticated approximation of Einsteinian gravity, thereby improving  significantly the realism of future CCSN studies. The new models will be used to make predictions for the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time, in core collapse supernovae. Such supernovae are among the three primary sources that will produce gravitational waves detectable by the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The PI will work closely with members of the LIGO Collaboration to develop new tools for LIGO data analysis. This project will train a graduate student in CCSN theory and gravitational wave astronomy and will provide a research opportunity for an intern in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Ph.D. program.<br/><br/>Advanced multi-physics models of core collapse supernovae that include multi-frequency neutrino transport with a complete set of neutrino weak interactions and key relativistic corrections such as gravitational redshift, have implemented to date only an effective self-gravitational potential, which is computed using the Newtonian potential obtained by solving the Poisson equation with a correction to the monopole term. The latter is determined from an integral formulation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation using angle-average densities. More realistic CCSN models require more sophisticated treatments of the general relativistic gravity. In this project, the PI and his students will implement the Conformally Flat Approximation in CCSN models. This approximation has been shown to describe well general relativistic gravity in systems without rapid rotation or black hole formation, suitable for most CCSN studies. The new models will be used to compute the emission of gravitational radiation in CCSN models using the weak-field, slow-motion approximation and will provide new gravitational wave data to the gravitational wave astronomy community."

This award supports research that centers around experiments making precise measurements of physical properties of the free neutron. In the UCNA (Ultra-Cold Neutron Asymmetry) experiment, carried out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, extremely slow neutrons are used, which have such low energy that they can be trapped and studied. This allows the scientists to make a precise measurement of the radioactive decay of the neutron into a proton, an electron and a particle called an anti-neutrino. This provides needed information about the theory of radioactivity (also called the weak nuclear force) as well as looking for small deviations from the known physical laws as a signature of new physics. In addition, this group is leading the development of equipment for a very sensitive experiment to search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The existence of this EDM would be a signal of new physics beyond our current knowledge and could help to explain why the observed universe is dominated by matter. Our present Standard Model of particle physics predicts that there should be nearly equal amounts of matter and antimatter in today's universe, which is not observed. This remains one of the great puzzles in our basic understanding of the evolution of our universe.  Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates is an essential part of the research program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in this frontier area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>This project is primarily focused on experimental research addressing fundamental properties of the free neutron. In particular the group will continue analyzing data from the UCNA experiment, in particular searching for new scalar and tensor forces not present in our present understanding of particle interactions. The group is also constructing experimental equipment for a new, highly sensitive experiment to search for the neutron's EDM. New results from the UCNA experiment will provide a sensitive search for new scalar or tensor components in the weak force, the so-called Fierz interference, by comparing the energy dependence of both the beta-decay asymmetry and the electron energy spectra simultaneously to further improve the sensitivity. The PI and his group are also collecting data for an improved measurement of the neutron lifetime using UCN at the Los Alamos UCN facility and anticipate results from both of these projects during the period of this grant. The PI plays a leading role in the development and construction of a new experiment searching for the electric dipole moment of the free neutron. The goal of the new neutron Electric Dipole Moment experiment - nEDM - at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is to improve the sensitivity of the measurement by two orders of magnitude compared to previous work. The observation of a neutron electric dipole moment signals violation of time-reversal symmetry, and could provide important information related to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe and the new physical phenomena that is responsible for it. The critical cryogenic magnets and magnetic shielding of the experiment will be commissioned at Caltech and should receive the first cold-neutron beam at SNS for neutron polarization studies during the period of this proposed grant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new particles, symmetries or forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). This project is designed to pursue searches for BSM physics.<br/><br/>The LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.   The Syracuse University group is a collaboration member of LHCb, an experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at the LHC. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. <br/><br/>The Syracuse group plays a leading role in the physics analysis of LHCb. Their ongoing analyses shed light on important aspects of our understanding of the Standard Model, including CP asymmetry which could explain the preponderance of matter in the universe as opposed to antimatter.  Additionally, the group is one of the lead institutions in the design, development, and construction of a new tracking detector subsystem for LHCb called the UT, which will increase the data throughput of the experiment by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics more deeply. The UT is a state of the art silicon tracking detector, which will play a crucial role in providing fast momentum measurements of particles, many of which are from b and c hadron decays of interest.<br/> <br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas, from student research experiences for grads and undergrads, to a very active QuarkNet Center and Masterclass programs for high school teachers and students.   For many years a steady stream of undergraduates has been working in the group's laboratories, where it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have direct engagement in both instrumentation development as well as data analysis.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the fabrication and testing of the UT detector that is under construction.  The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse QuarkNet program to involve high school teachers and high school students. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results.  Young and nontraditional researchers will be integral participants in this exciting program of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, they rely on interacting neural and mechanical systems that must operate in the context of the physics of sensing, actuation, and environmental interactions. Modern data acquisition tools provide unprecedented access to the underlying neural, muscular, and mechanical signals that implement control. However, these signals alone are not a framework for understanding how sensory information transforms into motor outputs. This CAREER project leverages several emerging experimental and analytical techniques to show how locomotor dynamics emerge from this sensorimotor transform. This framework for extracting principles of sensorimotor control is based on combining high-resolution neuromuscular recordings, information theoretic and dimensionality-reduction data analytics, and the formal language of system identification and control theory. The experimental framework of this proposal is transferrable to other living and engineered systems composed of many subsystems connected by feedback such as gene or protein networks, cell mechanics, or population dynamics. Principles of locomotor control that emerge from this work will synergize with the BRAIN initiative and similar programs by providing context through which to interpret a deep, detailed understanding of brain structure, anatomy, and connectivity. They will also address challenges in the new era of robotics and neural engineering. There is a pressing need for neuro-technologies that enable versatile movement while embodied in physical systems. More broadly this work will enable translation of research-based undergraduate learning into scientific and education products. It will bring a neuroscience component to the growing Physics of Living Systems curriculum at Georgia Tech. Within the VIP program, students will receive training at the interface of biology, physics, and engineering by engaging in research-based learning that is organized into a vertical mentoring system. Ultimately the study of how brain and body control movement is an accessible context in which to engage the public and further converge education of physics and biology even outside the walls of the research university.<br/><br/>The research uses three experimental platforms (two animals and one robot).

The PI's work also explores the performance consequences of different control architectures and the sensorimotor determinants on maneuverability. The program will use the interdisciplinary study of movement to create a scientific foundry for the Physics of Living Systems at Georgia Tech with an emphasis on how physics approaches provide a context for understanding neural signals. The core of the foundry will be a vertically integrated research team of undergraduates that will complete the loop of research-based education to classroom-inspired research. To transfer the impact outside the university, the researchers will team with local high school teachers to innovate new education tools based on the accessibility of high-speed imaging, surface electromyography, and the study of movement."

The basic features of most of these processes are well understood. However, one of the major open questions is the nature of the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which is responsible for the synthesis of roughly half of the chemical elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium. Astronomical observations indicate that the r-process has been active since the early stages of galactic history, and takes place in explosive stellar environments, such as supernovae explosions or mergers between two neutron stars, but the details are not known. A major difficulty to understanding the r-process is that it involves unstable isotopes.  The main activities supported by this award are a series of nuclear physics experiments to measure the radioactive decay properties of isotopes directly relevant to r-process studies. The experimental setup combines state-of-the-art radiation detectors for beta-decay measurements (BRIKEN), and unstable isotope beams at leading accelerator facilities in Japan (RIBF) and the US (NSCL). The nuclear data obtained in this experiments will allow for a more precise comparison between astronomical observations and astrophysical models for the r-process.  Another objective of this proposal is to provide students, especially at the undergraduate level, with opportunities to become involved in research activities at the forefront of nuclear physics, and contribute to expanding the number of students pursuing scientific careers in the US.  For this reason, the proposal includes research projects that will take place at the campus of Central Michigan University (CMU), such as the development of radiation detectors and computational work with astrophysical models of the r-process.<br/><br/>The main scientific outcome of this award will be the measurement of beta-delayed neutron emission probabilities (Pn values) with the new BRIKEN detector setup at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory in RIKEN, Japan. The BRIKEN setup consists of an active stopper detector for radioactive ion beams, surrounded by a high-efficiency neutron detector composed of He-3 proportional counters. The experiments currently planned will measure Pn values, as well as decay half-lives, for neutron-rich isotopes spanning the regions from the N=50 shell closure up to the rare-earth elements. These experiments will provide new nuclear data for r-process models in regions of the nuclear chart relevant to address important questions of r-process nucleosynthesis, such as the astrophysical conditions that lead to the formation of elements in the A=130 abundance peak.  The award will also support the participation of CMU researchers in r-process experiments at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University. This includes a project to develop reaccelerated beams of heavy isotopes around the N=82 region, with the potential to open new opportunities for r-process measurements."

Inside these objects, exotic particles such as hyperons and deconfined quarks that do not exist in a stable form anywhere else in the universe can be created. This project proposes an in-depth investigation of new kinds of matter inside neutron stars as well as the effects of incredibly strong magnetic fields, many orders of magnitude larger than the one present inside the Sun, on these phases of matter. The results of this research will be used by the astrophysics community to search for clear signals of stable exotic matter in neutrinos bursts and gravitational waves. The project involves the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students in astrophysics research, and includes a series of seminars open for the community that highlights the role of female astrophysicists.<br/><br/>The project will pursue an extension of a realistic description of hadronic and quark phases in the core of neutron stars to include magnetic fields together with finite temperature effects. This will enable effects of strong magnetic fields to be studied in different regions of stars, not only for cold neutron stars but also for proto-neutron stars. For the latter case, this project will also study the effects of neutrinos and entropy per particle on the structure of phase transitions. With these ingredients in hand, complete data tables will be built from a realistic equation of state to be used by others in dynamical simulations of supernova explosions, compact binary mergers, and neutron star cooling, to answer a fundamental question in astrophysics: Do exotic degrees of freedom play a role in the above phenomena? Having the first extensive data table built from a single realistic description will be extremely useful and allow for more accurate dynamical calculations of astrophysical phenomena. The students involved in the project will make meaningful contributions to state-of-the-art research.

In turn, nucleons (protons and neutrons) make up more than 99% of the mass of the visible matter of the universe. Nucleons are composed of quarks and gluons (partons), the fundamental particles of QCD. The structure of the nucleon is studied using high-energy scattering processes at state-of-the-art experimental facilities in the USA and abroad. This project will provide theoretical guidance and help analyze experimental data generated at those experimental facilities.  Furthermore, the PI will mentor graduate students and engage in outreach activities addressing high school students, teachers, and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The project will primarily concentrate on two topics in hadronic physics.  First, a new fit of the transversity distribution will be performed for di-hadron production, which is generally considered a very clean channel.  After a careful leading-order analysis, the transversity will be extracted in a collinear next-to-leading (NLO) order framework.  This requires, in particular, the first-ever challenging NLO calculation of the relevant di-hadron observables in electron-positron annihilation, lepton-nucleon scattering and proton-proton collision.  This study is expected to shed new light on the longstanding tension between information on the nucleon's transversity from experimental data on the one hand and from lattice QCD on the other.  The second part of the project deals with partonic Wigner functions.  For a number of reasons, partonic Wigner functions have attracted enormous interest over the last years.  Despite their importance, presently no experimental information is available on these objects.  The main focus will therefore be on observables for Wigner functions.  This includes numerical estimates of observables, the calculation of higher-order corrections, and the search for new processes in which Wigner functions show up.  Special attention will be paid to the question about how a future electron-ion collider (EIC) can further this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator.  It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment, looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. The CMS physics analysis supported by this award will focus on Supersymmetry(SUSY) and Dark Matter, both proposed BSM. A means of identifying b-quarks in the CMS data ( b-tagging) will be further developed and refined by this award. One SUSY candidate is the stop quark, the supersymmetric partner of the SM top quark. Decay products of stop quarks involve top quarks and b-tagging is the tool to find events with top quarks. In addition, events with directly produced top quarks serve as backgrounds to signal events that contain top squarks. The CMS Pixel Detector is the tool to efficiently provide precise tracking and b-tagging needed for SUSY searches.  The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."

It can be used to predict the observational consequences (both in terms of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation) of black holes and neutron stars and ordinary stars colliding, and it can also be used to discern from observations what the Big Bang was like. One particularly useful way to work with Einstein's theory is by formulating it as an initial value problem: According to this formulation, to construct spacetimes of use in modeling gravitational physics, one first chooses an initial state for the spacetime (at some arbitrary time of interest), and one then constructs the spacetime by evolving both into the past and the future of this initial state. Einstein's equations (at the heart of Einstein's theory) both control possible choices of the initial state, and determine how the evolution proceeds. The research supported in this proposal involves how to make choices of the initial state which satisfy the Einstein constraint equations; it also involves determining the generic behavior of solutions as one approaches ""singular regions"" of the spacetime (near the Big Bang, for example). Besides studies of the behavior of solutions of Einstein's equations, this grant also supports studies of solutions of geometric heat flow equations such as the Ricci flow and mean curvature flow. Here, the interest is in the mathematical relationship between topological spaces and the types of curvature that they can support. Remarkably, some of the techniques used in the study of geometric heat flow solutions are also useful in studying solutions of Einstein's equations.<br/><br/>Among the specific projects supported by this grant are the following:<br/>1) Solutions of the Einstein constraint equations: Two approaches have been developed for constructing and studying solutions of the constraints: The first of these, the conformal method, works beautifully for constant mean curvature (""CMC"") and near-CMC solutions of the vacuum or electrovac Einstein constraints (with nonpositive cosmological constant), but appears to have major problems otherwise. This grant supports work which studies  these problems---non-existence and non-uniqueness of solutions---in a number of cases, including asymptotically Euclidean (""AE"") and asymptotically hyperbolic (""AH"") solutions, as well as solutions on closed manifolds. The second approach, gluing, allows known solutions of the constraints to be joined to produce new ones--e.g., N-body initial data sets.  AH initial data must be ""shear-free"" if it is to be used to produce asymptotically flat spacetimes; hence this grant supports work to develop gluing techniques which allow the joining at infinity of a pair of shear-free AH solutions, thereby producing a new shear-free AH solution (with a single asymptotic region).<br/>2) Strong Cosmic Censorship: For almost 50 years, one of the major questions in mathematical relativity has been if the ubiquitous geodesic incompleteness in maximal spacetime developments predicted by the Hawking-Penrose ""singularity theorems"" is generically accompanied by spacetime curvature blowup. Geodesically incomplete solutions of Einstein's equations with bounded curvature (allowing extensions across a Cauchy horizon) are known; but the ""Strong Cosmic Censorship (""SCC"") conjecture suggests that this does not happen generically. Model versions of SCC have been proven for families of solutions, such as the Gowdy spacetimes. In these proofs, verifying ""AVTD"" behavior (dominance of time derivatives over space derivatives near the singular region) has been a crucial tool. The PI and collaborators has developed the singular initial value problem as a way of identifying AVTD behavior, and proposes to use it to find non-analytic AVTD solutions among vacuum solutions with one Killing field, and among Einstein-scalar solutions with no Killing fields. Other supported works seeks to show that the AVTD behavior of Kasner solutions is stable among solutions with two Killing fields. <br/>3) Expanding Cosmologies: The PI and his collaborators propose to use a combination of numerical and analytical studies to explore the expanding direction of model cosmological spacetimes. There is good evidence for strongly attracting ""entropic"" behavior. This grant supports work to verify and explore this behavior. <br/>4) Ricci Flow Near Kahler Geometries: For certain even-dimensional manifolds M, the set of Kahler geometries on M forms a subspace of the space of all Riemannian geometries on M. A Ricci flow solution which begins at a Kahler geometry remains Kahler. Are there Ricci flow solutions which begin outside  the set of Kahler geometries but asymptotically approach it?  The PI and his collaborators are working to show that this is the case, for a certain class of geometries.<br/>5) Stability of Neckpinch Behavior in Geometric Heat Flows: Neckpinch behavior in Ricci flow and mean curvature flow is well-understood for rotationally symmetric geometries and embeddings. There is evidence, both numerical and analytical, that such behavior is stable. The PI and his collaborators propose further work to verify this stability."

This work will address these questions in three concrete experimental contexts in quantum simulator platforms, promoting national interests through the progress of science.  This work will expand atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information science further into complexity science, providing a concrete way to quantify complexity of quantum states.  It will provide an interdisciplinary connection to statistical physics and complex network science, applied up till now mainly at the classical level.  The semiconductor technological revolution is based heavily on single-particle quantum mechanics, from band theory to quantum tunneling; the next step in quantum technology will certainly involve entanglement.  This proposal will explore complexity science as a key component of that next revolution, by determining the complexity of entanglement.<br/><br/>This team will explore the complexity of quantum critical phenomena by applying complex network measures to quantum mutual information, bounded from below by all two-point correlators.  What is the role of finite temperature and disorder in complexity?  How does complexity depend on different universality classes?  Second, this team will study the emergence of complexity in quantum cellular automata, in particular in Goldilocks rules, which exhibit robust dynamical features and persistent entropy fluctuations.  What are the dynamical properties of complexity?  Does it decohere easily?  How sensitive is it to gate fidelity in quantum operations, or precision of a Hamiltonian realized in a quantum simulator?  Third, this team will apply complex network measures to higher order phase correlators in atom interferometry.  Does complexity depend on the order of the correlator?  What new features might be unlocked in the high-dimensional spaces of such correlators with a complexity perspective?

The goal is to extract the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and compare this with theoretical predictions. The group will also search for indications that strongly interacting matter is expected based on symmetry principles. For example, interactions of neutrinos with nuclei is important for the understanding of supernova explosions. In addition, this group will measure the lifetime of the free neutron, since this is important input to test the Big Bang theory of element creation.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research supported by this award investigates: (1) How the spin of the proton is distributed among its parts.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). One of the promising techniques to look for BSM physics is to make precision measurements using standard particles like electrons and muons. One technique, in particular, is to make very precise measurements of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of electrons or muons. To do the next generation of EDM measurements will require advances in accelerator techniques and this award will  focus on those advancements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Direct EDM searches using all-electric storage rings, with measurements of stored electrons, protons, or radioactive nuclei are being considered. Historically only a very small number of all-electric rings have been constructed and none at the scale envisioned for these dedicated EDM measurements. Thus, the research enabled here will provide essential insights into the feasibility of using larger-scale high-gradient electric field devices for these important measurements. The success of the EDM experimental procedure is strongly connected to the ability to create a suitably robust storage ring that can perform the desired functions necessary for successful spin precession measurements of intense beams at the accuracies required. Through this award, studies will be performed in pursuit of storage ring arrangements and parameter sets suitable for use in EDM measurements. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to beam conditions being created for a present-day EDM measurement of the muon system. This award will provide students of accelerator science the opportunity to engage with expert members of the field to acquire first-hand experience in the design and specification process for relevant storage ring systems for future EDM experiments, yielding a more experienced workforce upon exit from the university program.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Accelerator science will lead the way to future accelerators for virtually every branch of science and for a broad spectrum of applications to meet national needs, and collaboration between national laboratories and research universities is a natural approach to attract, train and educate a new generation of accelerator scientists and engineers. The learning curve for scientists to cross into the applied field of accelerator science is often long, and hence acquiring practical skill and knowledge as graduate students will provide a highly desired early-experience for future members of the much-needed workforce. The training and experiences enabled through this award will ultimately reach into many areas of research as the workforce expands into other technical disciplines."

In a quantum information network, whose purpose is to store, transmit and manipulate information in ways not possible using classical physics techniques, photons transfer quantum information between network nodes. Single photons are characterized by their color (frequency), polarization orientation, spatial beam profile, and temporal shape. Only recently has the temporal shape of photons been recognized as an underutilized resource for encoding quantum information. The PI will develop methods to encode quantum information in the temporal shape of single-photon wave packets, and to demonstrate means for manipulating such encoded information. This research has the potential to advance quantum information science by improving the ability to store larger amounts of information in single photons in a manner that is compatible with optical-fiber networks. The research will impact the growing field of quantum information technology, including quantum computing, and offers excellent opportunities to integrate science education with research. <br/><br/>The research builds on the PI's recent successful demonstration of the crucially needed information-processing device - the quantum pulse gate - that is capable of sorting (and routing) optical pulses according to their temporal shape. The research aims to develop the complete set of conceptual and practical tools needed for performing quantum information operations using temporal (wave-packet) modes of light. Temporal modes (TMs) form a discrete set of field-orthogonal pulse shapes that occupy the same region of time-frequency (phase) space. The researchers recently experimentally demonstrated their proposed method for separating (sorting) temporal modes by using a novel form of optical frequency conversion. Unlike polarization, which is fundamentally a two-state system, the temporal-mode basis offers the possibility for multi-level quantum logic (qudits).  For TMs to rise to their potential as a tool for quantum information science, it needs to be demonstrated that all of the quantum resources and operations needed for QIS with temporal modes are available. Specifically, the researchers will work to demonstrate: 1) a source of TM-entangled photons, 2) quantum state tomography in the TM basis, 3) quantum process tomography of the QPG device itself, and 4) coherent and efficient manipulation of light in field-orthogonal TMs to implement single-photon quantum logic gates.   Controlling the states of quantum systems is of broad interest in science and information technology, metrology, quantum chemistry, and nano-mechanics. Optical technology and quantum-optics-based information science offer excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education. The PI cofounded in 2010 the Science Literacy Program (SLP) at the University of Oregon, and served as Co-Director, and is currently on the Advisory Board. The SLP provides mentored instructional opportunities to many graduate students and undergraduate science majors serving as co-instructors in science literacy courses, which have impacted thousands of students at the university. During this project the PI will teach and mentor instructors for an SLP course that presents quantum information science to non-science majors, using inquiry-based-learning techniques to engage students. The PI has published a popular-level book for the course, Quantum Physics: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford, 2017), and will continue promoting education using material from this book as part of this project. A PhD student working in quantum information science research served as co-instructor to plan the course learning goals, prepare and present several class lectures, write homework and exam questions, and facilitate group problem-solving activities during class sessions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. This project focuses on the DAMIC-M (Dark Matter In CCDs) experiment, which will search beyond the heavy WIMP paradigm by detecting nuclear recoils and electrons induced by light DM in charge-coupled devices (CCDs).

This award provides US support for the construction of the DAMIC-M detector.<br/><br/>Immersive research experiences, engagement of the local community and innovative partnerships will bring DM science to formal and informal audiences. Research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups - e.g., U. Chicago and Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge, the Community College Transfer Program at U. Washington - will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The local community will be broadly engaged in Chicago by integrating high school URM students of the Space Explorers Program and of the STEM Science Inquiry and Research program in a stimulating research environment, by enhancing the RISE program for URM middle-school students and by communicating science to older adults via the Life-long Learning program; in the Pacific Northwest by engaging science school teachers in research at U. Washington through the Partners in Science program. DM science will reach broad and diverse audiences through partnerships with the Adler Planetarium, in particular with the high-impact (50,000 visitors/yr) Adler Astronomy Conversations program, where scientists interact directly with museum visitors.<br/><br/>In this novel and unconventional use of CCDs, which are commonly employed for digital imaging in astronomical telescopes, the ionization charge will be detected in the most massive CCDs ever built with exquisite spatial resolution. The crucial innovation in these devices is the non-destructive, repetitive measurement of the pixel charge, which results in the high-resolution detection of a single electron and unprecedented sensitivity to light DM (~ eV energies are enough to free an electron in silicon). By counting individual charges in a detector with extremely low leakage current - a combination unmatched by any other DM experiment - DAMIC-M will take a leap forward of several orders of magnitude in the exploration of the hidden sector, a jump that may be rewarded by serendipitous discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Success in QIS could revolutionize both technology and science through new computation and communication capabilities. Major breakthroughs are still needed before these can become reality. It is generally recognized that the most powerful quantum computation will take place using material systems (atoms or electrons). In contrast, quantum communication across a network (a ""Quantum Internet"") will take place using light (photons). In addition, specialized quantum-information processing will take place using light or a combination of light and interacting atoms, as needed, for example, to construct signal repeaters for extending the range of quantum communication over longer distances. This project will develop a radical, yet practical, new approach to using photons to encode quantum information.<br/><br/>Photons in a light beam have four distinct properties, any of which could be used to encode quantum-information: polarization (e.g., vertical or horizontal), two-dimensions of beam profile (spatial shape), and temporal shape (variation in time of brightness during a light pulse). In order to fully utilize light for transmitting information in a quantum network, it is necessary to be able to manipulate and sort a beam of light according to the states associated with each of these properties. While polarization and spatial beam profiles have been previously developed as means for encoding quantum information on photons, the temporal shape of photons has gone largely unrecognized as an important potential technique. The project endeavors to complete the ""tool kit"" for photon-based QIS by developing means to use photon temporal shape to encode information. This approach has predicted benefits in that 1) it allows more than one bit of information to be encoded on a single photon, 2) the encoding method is robust against the alterations of light that occur while traveling in a long optical fiber, and 3) the method nicely interfaces with atom-based quantum-light memories, which will be used in the future construction of a Quantum Internet.  <br/><br/>Controlling quantum systems is of broad interest in science and information technology, metrology, quantum chemistry, and nano-mechanics. Optical technology and quantum-optics-based information science offer excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education. To improve the quality of general science education for non-science majors, the P.I. cofounded in 2010 the Science Literacy Program (SLP) at the University of Oregon, and serves as its Co-Director. The SLP has provided mentored instructional opportunities to many graduate students and undergraduate science majors serving as co-instructors in science literacy courses. He developed and taught an SLP course, Quantum Physics for Everyone, which presented quantum information science to non-science majors, using active learning techniques to engage the students. He will continue serving as SLP Co-Director.<br/><br/>From a more technical perspective, the project will develop the idea that in QIS, temporal modes (TMs) of photons, and more generally light fields, should be viewed on an equal footing with polarization and transverse modes. TMs are wave-packet modes that have the same carrier frequency, polarization, and transverse spatial mode, and occupy the same time bin, but yet are temporal orthogonal. To enable the development of TMs for use as qubits and qudits, the central needed technology is the quantum pulse gate (QPG), which will implement a near-100% efficient spatial sorting of field-orthogonal TMs. Based on their recently proposed method of temporal-mode interferometry (TMI), the researchers will demonstrate the elements of a complete quantum information framework that employs field orthogonality of single-photon temporal modes. The three requirements - generation of resource states, the targeted and efficient manipulation of TMs, and their detection and characterization - can be fulfilled with current technology. In particular, the researchers will study, experimentally and theoretically, means for implementing single-qubit quantum-logic operations (Pauli-X, -Y, and -Z gates; and phase-shift gate) using the quantum pulse gate device as the basic building block. They will also demonstrate that the QPG can act as a real-time controllable switch that is temporal-mode selective, by varying a phase shift internal to the device. In addition, they will demonstrate means for verifying the fidelity of such gate operations, using a new form of quantum-state tomography, which can determine the quantum state directly in a TM basis."

This work is targeted towards applying a sodium spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to generate massive entanglement in the vicinity of Dicke states through adiabatic evolution across a quantum phase transition, and to create spin-squeezing via collectively coupling atoms to a light field with a quantum non-demolition measurement. The goals of this research are both of fundamental interest for advancing our understanding of quantum physics, and of technological significance.

They are used in a wide variety of applications in all areas of science and industry, such as searching for mineral resources, biomedical imaging for early detection and diagnostics, and the exploration of environmental hazards.  As with all measurement techniques, the goals of a magnetometry measurement are to reach a sensitivity that will allow the detection of smaller and smaller quantities and a resolution that will allow pinpointing location to smaller and smaller sizes.  The research supported under this CAREER award will incorporate ultracold BECs into proven optical measurement methods for atom magnetometry, which relies on atomic signals for detection,  that were previously based on techniques using hot atomic vapors.  The new cold atom approach will make it possible to develop magnetometers with enhanced magnetic field sensitivity and spatial resolution. Beyond the important research goals, this CAREER award will provide excellent opportunities to introduce students to modern developments in quantum physics, to involve them in research projects, and to prepare them for a career in science and technology. Two new laboratory courses in physics will be developed to better prepare the students for advanced research. Active efforts will be undertaken to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in this project by involving Native American students, women in physics, and potential ?first-generation? college students in research and educational activities.

This award focuses on determining if neutrinos are their own anti-particles using the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments developed by the Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory (NEMO) collaboration.  A prototype of the SuperNEMO design will be commissioned soon, and this award will support the research of a graduate student who will earn his dissertation using the newly commissioned equipment.  The research will include background analysis, energy resolution improvements, and a search for neutrinoless double beta decay.

This unique technique provides several observables for each registered event, offering a powerful means to identify double beta decays and to reject background processes.  SuperNEMO will further exploit the NEMO-3 technique.  The goal of SuperNEMO is to use 100 kg of Se-82 or some other isotope to probe the half-life for neutrinoless double beta decay at the level of 1x10^(26) years in a 500kg*year exposure, corresponding to the effective neutrino mass in the 50 meV range.

Instead, it will save data in the energy levels of quantum systems such as atoms, ions, or molecules.  Relatively simple molecules are favorable candidates because such molecules have enough levels to encode all the information, but not so many as to make them difficult to control.   To take advantage of this approach, however, molecules must be held in one place for long enough to prepare them in an energy level, wait for a computation to occur, and then read out the information again.   Holding molecules so still, nearly at rest, is challenging because molecules at room temperature tend to vigorously move, vibrate, and rotate.  Taming all of that movement requires that molecules to be chilled to a low temperature, just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. This project will explore ways to cool molecules, and thereby prepare their external (motional) and internal (rotational and vibrational) states, by using collisions with slow (""laser cooled"") atoms that can act as a refrigerator to ""sympathetically cool"" the molecules. To inform this approach, part of the project will be devoted to calculating the energy landscapes for atoms and molecules as a function of their separation, their orientation, and their internal energy states. The probabilities of ""inelastic"" (internal-state-changing) collisions will also be calculated. Together, these calculations will help this research team analyze the feasibility of different ways to prepare ultra-cold molecules. As part of this project, students will also receive training on how to perform these calculations and how to evaluate the benefits of such ultra-cold molecules for quantum technologies, important preparation for the future workforce in this emerging area. <br/><br/>For several decades now, physicists have been successful in cooling and trapping simple atoms with laser-generated forces to get gasses down to temperatures near absolute zero, for example using optical molasses and magneto-optical traps. These approaches, however, have limited applications for molecules, because molecules lack a cycling transition. In this project, the principal investigator will theoretically study a novel cooling technique whereby molecules are manipulated by collisions with laser cooled atoms. In particular, in inelastic collisions, atoms steal energy from the molecule and then fly away leaving the molecule colder, both internally and externally. This project will rely on quantum dynamics calculations and hybrid semi-classical scattering models to understand the collision processes for atoms and molecules.   Of particular interest are molecules with a chemical bond that is dominated by a single-valence electron. They are both polar and paramagnetic, and thus can be manipulated by electric and magnetic fields. An optically-trapped array of such molecules is a candidate system for error-free quantum computation."

The group studies the properties of the neutrino, the most prolific particle in the universe, about which much is still unknown. The primary effort is the search for the hypothesized, but not yet discovered, nuclear-radioactive decay called zero-neutrino double-beta decay. The existence of such a radioactive decay mode has important consequences. Its existence requires that neutrinos have mass, and that they are their own anti-particles. Most importantly, this process would require the violation of an important fundamental conservation law of elementary particle physics.  The USC group has leadership roles in two of the leading experiments in this field: the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, and the Cryogenic Underground Observatory (CUORE) in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy.  The spin-off technology from the required radiopurity of materials for the ultra-low background detectors has transitioned directly into Homeland Security.   Four past USC PhD students from the program hold important positions in Homeland Security, at the Pacific Northwest and Savannah River National Laboratories. <br/><br/><br/>CUORE, nearing completion in the LNGS, is an array of 988 tellurium oxide single-crystal bolometers that operate at ~8-10 mK to search for the zero-neutrino decay of tellurium-130 (Te-130); the detector will contain 200-kg of Te-130. The predicted half-life sensitivity is ~10^(26) years, to reach into the inverted hierarchy neutrino-mass region. USC leads part of the R&D to determine the feasibility and cost of enriching CUORE to 93% in Te-130 from 33.4%, and equipping the bolometers with Cherenkov-light detectors to discriminate against alpha-particle background. These upgrades are designed to reach the sensitivity required to cover the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. USC leads the CUORE data analysis to search for zero-neutrino double-beta decay of Te-130 to the first excited 0+ state in xenon-130, by detecting the coincidence events from the two electrons and cascade gamma rays. This technique achieved zero-background in the prototype experiment, CUORICINO. Finally, the USC group was responsible for the production of the CUORE front-end electronics, and will participate in its installation, commissioning and maintenance."

This was apparent as early as the nineteenth century from the extensive interconnectivity of nearby neurons and continues to be apparent from numerous measurements of the tuning curves and correlation of nearby neurons. Despite its fundamental importance, population neural codes are poorly understood. In this project the PI will test a recently developed principle for population code - namely, that neural activity patterns should always be organized into a discrete set of clusters. This organization is appealing, because clusters exhibit error correction, encode qualitatively different stimulus features than their constituent neurons, and can be learned in an unsupervised fashion by downstream neural circuits. Together, these properties enable a powerful form of hierarchical detection of complex stimulus features. The PI aims at developing a principle of population coding that applies widely across the brain. Furthermore, his hypothesis is connected to a model of hierarchical feature detection, which may be operating across all the ascending pathways in the neocortex. In addition, the neocortex's modular structure lends itself to machine learning algorithms. In addition,the project will involve the development and dissemination of software to perform fits of maximum entropy and hidden Markov models to neural data, which could help spur on the research programs of many labs that use these methods to analyze neural populations.<br/><br/>This proposal will combine large-scale neural recording methods from the retina and cortex with state-of-the-art theoretical analyses to study collective phenomena in population neural codes. The PI has an extensive track record in multi-electrode recording from the vertebrate retina, along with applying maximum entropy models to analyze states of network activity. In addition, the PI has recently started a collaboration with Prof. David Tank to record from cortical populations using two-photon calcium fluorescence imaging. The project's aims are: 1. Study how cluster codes can simultaneously encode categorical and continuous stimulus information; if true, this idea would constitute a new example of multiplexed coding in neural populations 2. Study how biologically plausible neural networks can learn and readout clusters; if true, then this makes possible hierarchical cluster processing in the neocortex and will lead us to formulate specific experimental tests to see if layer 4 of V1 is learning LGN clusters. 3. Test whether cluster codes are present in central brain areas, like the visual cortex and hippocampus; this study may generalize his results beyond the retina and help establish a new design principle for population codes.

This research is centered on precision measurements of pion and kaon properties that have the potential to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the nucleons, the protons and neutrons that, together with their interactions, generate nearly of the mass of the visible universe.  As such, this work probes the fundamental structure of that part of the universe that we can see.  This project is part of a series of experiments taking place at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory. Early career scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students play an integral part in this project, which provides them with opportunities to further develop their training and education. These include gaining experience in the design, assembly, and testing of modern instrumentation for the detection of radiation and subatomic particles and fast signal processing electronics, and in analyzing scientific data. Furthermore, learning to work in a large international scientific community will prepare early career scientists and students for the modern work environment at academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry.<br/> <br/>This program is focused on precision measurements of pion and kaon form factors and structure functions, and validation of our understanding of hard exclusive and semi-inclusive reactions towards 3D hadron imaging and potential future flavor decomposition. Form factors are the most basic quantity towards understanding transverse spatial structure.  The structure functions are expected to be different for pions, kaons, and nucleons regarding sea quarks and gluons and provide basic information about the origin of mass. 3D hadron imaging allows for the extraction of correlations between quark longitudinal momentum and transverse position from the experiment using factorization theorems. To validate the meson factorization theorems and potential future flavor decomposition, one has to measure the longitudinal and transverse (L/T) separated cross sections. This project plays a central role in this effort through precision pion, and kaon L/T separated cross section measurements at the 12 GeV Jefferson Lab and development of measurements of the, to date, mostly unknown pion and kaon structure functions at a potential future Electron-Ion Collider."

Fundamental research is required to accelerate the development of new technologies for neuroscience and near engineering in order to address important societal needs with respect to the development of new ways to treat, prevent, and cure brain disorders. In this larger context, this collaborative project will extend methods of statistical physics to bridge from microscopic neurobiological observations of neurons, axons and dendrites to the mesoscopic images of brain organization seen in diffusion MRI images of the entire primate brain. A particular focus will be to address the question of how the processes of the brain might exploit this special architecture for the representation and processing of information, and in particular, how this regular structure might support time-coding and synchronization of information across the brain.<br/><br/>Joining a physics laboratory, a neurobiology laboratory, and an MRI laboratory, this team will investigates the hypothesis that brain connectivity is geometrically organized, with connectivity generally aligned with the axes of a curved, but essentially orthogonal coordinate system or 3D grid. The idea that the brain of all species with bilateral symmetry is based on an orthogonal plan is not new. It has been recognized in embryology and evolutionary biology for nearly 100 years and more recently has been validated in detail in studies of gene expression. Preliminary studies have suggested that this orthogonal motif pervades the structure of the brain, and particularly connectivity, from macroscopic down to a cellular level. In this interdisciplinary project, the investigators will quantify this phenomenon by looking at structural data from both diffusion MRI and advanced methods of 3D light microscopy and then apply the ideas and tools of condensed matter physics to characterize the structure and circuits of the brain as organized matter. As a first example, having observed 3 orthogonal fiber directions at each point in the brain that vary smoothly, it is natural to model this as a liquid crystal with a deformation energy and temperature. Then, one can investigate its scaling in the brain, and transitions such as those from white matter to gray matter. Functionally, we hypothesize that this rectilinear grid, may provide a new mechanism for neural activity to be temporally correlated, owing to its extremely high degeneracy of path lengths and transmission delays, which we will model as a directed percolation."

The goal is to identify the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks.

The Standard Model of particle physics provides a remarkably successful description of the fundamental building blocks of Nature and the forces acting among them.  The absence of clear experimental evidence thus far for physics beyond the Standard Model challenges the idea of ""naturalness"" as the guiding principle in the search for new physics. It is therefore becoming more and more crucial to broadly explore new regimes of physics beyond the Standard Model.  The research of Professor Altmannshofer will serve the national interest by advancing our understanding of the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions.  In particular, his research aims to address the following fundamental questions:  Is the Higgs boson the origin of mass of all the known elementary matter particles?  Are there new fundamental forces among elementary particles beyond the strong, the weak, and the electromagnetic interactions?  Do elementary matter particles posses characteristic properties other than their mass and interactions that allow us to distinguish them?  As part of the proposed program, Professor Altmannshofer will also strengthen and extend the existing particle-physics outreach program at the Physics Department of the University of Cincinnati.  Students and teachers from local high schools will be invited to the department to participate in hands-on activities and to learn about the latest cutting-edge developments in particle physics.<br/> <br/>More technically, Professor Altmannshofer will construct and classify novel frameworks of mass generation for the light quarks and leptons and identify their characteristic signatures at high-energy and high-intensity experiments.  He will also develop new ways to search for feeble interactions among leptons and neutrinos at current and future neutrino facilities at Fermilab.  Furthermore, he will develop sophisticated methods to search for new sources of flavor and CP violation using rare b hadron decays that largely eliminate hadronic uncertainties.  Without such methods, the new physics sensitivity of rare b decays is limited by poorly understood hadronic contributions, and current hints for anomalies in the rare b decay data cannot be clarified.  Professor Altmannshofer's research program will provide several new and improved search strategies for physics beyond the Standard Model that are critical in enhancing the prospects for discovery at the energy and intensity frontiers."

The quarks and gluons give rise to a finite size of the proton, which is about 10,000 times smaller than the size of a single atom. The goal of this project is to measure the size of the proton.  An on-going puzzle is that the proton size appears to be different when measured with atomic hydrogen as compared with its counterpart, called muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in a hydrogen atom is replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. This project will specifically build equipment to be used in an experiment to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The seven standard deviation discrepancy between the proton radius measured with muonic hydrogen and with electron-proton scattering may point to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, or result from novel aspects of conventional physics or from issues in extracting the radius from experimental data. The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) aims to resolve the proton radius puzzle. MUSE uses a mixed pion, muon and electron beam at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. MUSE will determine the proton radius through both muon-proton scattering and electron-proton scattering, in addition to performing these reactions with positive and negative leptons. This not only reduces systematic uncertainties but also provides sensitivity to two-photon exchange contributions that may be responsible for some of the discrepancies seen in earlier experiments. This collaborative project supports the construction of MUSE over the period September 2016 - August 2018. There will also be ongoing testing and commissioning activities at PSI, including a dress rehearsal run with a partial spectrometer in late 2017."

It is a one-billion-ton detector that uses the deep Antarctic ice as a medium to detect high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos that originate from decays of elementary particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. While these can be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos, astrophysical neutrinos at higher energies are key probes of the high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos pass almost freely through even dense volumes of space and are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award will fund the deployment of seven additional strings of photon sensors in the deep, clear Antarctic ice at the bottom center of IceCube, forming the IceCube Gen2 Phase 1 extension (""Phase 1"").  <br/><br/>The availability of a deep-ice drill presents several opportunities to enhance the existing IceCube infrastructure for research and education.  Deep ice drills will also allow for the possibility of deploying next-generation optical sensor technology prototypes within the existing IceCube operations framework at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, presenting new opportunities for training a new cohort of international students and young scientists throughout the instrumentation development, production, and field deployment.  The combination of astrophysics and the extreme polar climate attracts wide popular interest.<br/><br/>The new strings will use multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs), providing better directionality and more than double the photocathode area per module, at lower cost per unit area, than traditional IceCube DOMs. The mDOMs will be tightly integrated into the existing IceCube data acquisition framework, at marginal added long-term maintenance and operations expense. The new instrumentation will dramatically boost IceCube's performance at the 5 GeV energy scale, yielding over an order of magnitude more statistics than current samples, and enabling IceCube to perform the world's best measurement of tau neutrino appearance and the world's most stringent test of unitarity in the tau sector of the PMNS (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) matrix.  This matrix describes all known neutrino oscillation behavior, and deviations from unitarity would be evidence for new physics.  The strings will feature new calibration devices that would allow to better model the optical properties of the ice, reducing systematic uncertainties in the tau neutrino appearance measurement and enhancing IceCube's already strong contribution to multimessenger astrophysics via improved reconstruction of the direction of high energy cascade events for searches of point sources and enhanced identification of PeV-scale tau neutrinos. High energy tau neutrinos are essentially guaranteed to be astrophysical in origin, and they are a unique probe of neutrino oscillation physics over ultra-long baselines, providing powerful complementarity with Phase 1's atmospheric tau neutrino appearance measurement at lower energies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these symmetries are an integral part of classical physics, both are known to be violated in the current ""Standard Model"" of particle physics. In fact, there have been many direct observations of parity violation, and several indirect measurements of time reversal symmetry breaking. EDMs, however, have yet to be observed. The major motivation for trying to observe EDMs is that most proposed extensions to the Standard Model (such as supersymmetry) predict EDMs that are in the vicinity of the current experimental upper limit, whereas the Standard Model predicts that they should be much smaller. Increasing the precision of experiments could rule out possible extensions to the Standard Model, or provide the first experimental result that cannot be incorporated into the Standard Model. As such it would be a harbinger of a theoretical revolution. To measure the electron EDM, cesium atoms will be cooled with laser beams and trapped with light, and then their internal energy states will be measured in a very large electric field in a very low magnetic field environment. Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained in the use of these tools, which have many applications beyond this measurement.<br/><br/>The electron EDM will be searched for in this experiment using laser-cooled cesium atoms.  The apparatus construction part of the experiment will be completed and data collection will commence. In the experiment, atoms are loaded into a pair of parallel one-dimensional far-off-resonant optical lattice traps in a magnetically shielded region of space, laser-cooled and optically pumped.  Similar to the way permanent magnetic dipole measurements are routinely measured by looking for linear Zeeman energy shifts in magnetic fields, the EDM will be searched for by looking for linear Stark shifts in an electric field. The experiment is designed to be insensitive to magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients by simultaneously measuring two sets of atoms that experience opposite electric fields. It is projected that the experiment will be sensitive to an EDM as small as 3x10-30 e-cm, which is a 30-fold improvement over the current limit. In parallel to making the EDM experiment fully operational, the group will perform a related technological study to try to maximize the electric fields that can be sustained with the conducting oxide coated glass plates that are used. Along the way, there are two atomic polarizability measurements that the apparatus is uniquely configured to measure with improved sensitivity. Before incorporating improved field plates, the group will likely perform these measurements, which can provide tests of atomic calculations and possible improvements to the understanding of cesium clock shifts."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the standard model predict not only new particles with masses above the electroweak scale (about 100 billion electron-volts, eV), but also so-called WISPs (Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles). The most famous WISP candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum ChromoDynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Similarly, axion-like particles, light spin 1 particles called ""hidden sector photons,"" seem to occur naturally in realistic embeddings of the standard model into string theory. It is therefore an important and fundamental question whether any of these weakly-interacting light particles exists. The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) experiment will give students and postdoctoral scientists the opportunity to develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines spanning lasers and optics, electronics and feedback control systems, vacuum and cryogenics, computational methods and data analysis algorithm development, large-scale detector commissioning and operation, dark-matter physics and cosmology. The required technologies are spin-offs of technologies which were developed for ground and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The work supported by this award would build on these investments and would allow continued development of high performance optical techniques and devices which have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.<br/><br/>The ALPS experiment under development at DESY in Germany is a 'light-shining-through-walls' search, where photons are projected to be converted into weakly interacting light particles which pass unimpeded through an opaque wall and convert (in part) back to photons behind the wall. The most famous of these particles are axions which require a strong magnetic field to convert to photons. Other particles which fall within the ALPS portfolio include hidden-sector photons which couple linearly to the electromagnetic field and do not require a static magnetic field. The planned ALPS@DESY experiments are the leading background-independent searches for axions and hidden sector photons. The improved sensitivity of ALPS would enable, for the first time, a purely laboratory experiment to probe axion-photon couplings at a level competitive with, or superior to, limits from stellar evolution or solar searches. The experiment only depends on the fundamental photon-axion interaction and not on solar models nor on assumptions about dark matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atoms will be cooled to extremely low temperatures and put into high energy states called Rydberg states.  In Rydberg states the outermost electron (or the negatively charged component of an atom) travels in extremely large orbits around the nucleus (or the core of an atom).  Because of these large orbits, atoms in Rydberg states have properties which are exaggerated relative to the properties of atoms in their natural, or ground state.  One such property is that Rydberg atoms interact strongly with each other when separated by large distances, even though they have no net charge.  Normally, when a laser is shined on a group of atoms, the outermost electron in each atom is readily promoted to Rydberg states.  However, the interactions among multiple Rydberg atoms causes this excitation to be suppressed, or ""blocked,"" and leads to the creation of fewer Rydberg atoms than would otherwise be created.  This suppression of excitation may help enable the use of single atoms as the ""bits"" in computer (""neutral atom quantum computing"").  Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize data security and encryption.  The present project will focus on processes which make the Rydberg excitation blockade function less effectively (state-mixing interactions).  Essentially, if one tries to put atoms into a given Rydberg state using a laser, the atoms will mix into other states.  This mixing ""breaks the blockade"" and leads to an undesirably large number of Rydberg atoms.  The goals of the present research are to quantify the extent to which state mixing interactions reduce the blockade efficiency, to understand the physical mechanism which gives rise to the mixing, and to study the experimental parameters which lead to the best excitation blockade.  Understanding these issues will allow other researchers to use the blockade in a way that minimizes unwanted effects when developing a quantum computer.  The project also involves a significant educational component.  The PI will develop educational modules for a diverse group, ranging from general education students to advanced physics students.   The PI will also study the impact of metacognitive exercises on problem solving performance in the introductory physics classroom.  All work will be done at a primarily undergraduate university with a significant fraction of first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The Rydberg excitation blockade, a process whereby strong interactions among highly-excited atoms suppress laser excitation, has been at the heart of an array of recent experimental achievements.  It has been suggested that state-mixing interactions, which result from couplings among multi-particle Rydberg states near a Frster resonance, may compromise the effectiveness of the excitation suppression under otherwise favorable conditions.  Experimentally, however, the extent to which the blockade is compromised has been unknown, as large amounts of state mixing have always accompanied an improved blockade near resonance.  In this project, the extent to which state-mixing reduces the blockade efficiency will be quantified using state-selective field ionization spectroscopy of rubidium Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap.  This work will lead to a better understanding of the physical mechanism responsible for enhanced state-mixing.  Additionally, the project will include a systematic study of the experimental conditions for the best blockade near a Frster resonance. The PI will design an eduational module on laser cooling and trapping for a general education course as well as an advanced laboratory experiment on characterizing an ultracold atom cloud in a magneto optical trap."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland.  It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering these Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. Some of the BSM theoretical predictions include several different Higgs boson that have enhanced coupling to b-quarks. This award will allow an improved b-quark study using a multivariate regression technique to better estimate the b-jet energy scale and thereby improve on the Higgs boson mass resolution. This so-called jet substructure technique is important for all the physics results coming out of CMS, as many decay channels require improved jet energy corrections.  Another BSM search that this award provides is the search for a heavy vector boson (generally referred to as Z prime) predicted to decay to a ttbar pair of quarks. The final state of this ttbar decay is b-jets, again, benefiting from the jet energy correction work in this award. The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."

Light-induced charge dynamics, for example, is ubiquitous in catalysis, photosynthesis, the photovoltaic effect, radiation damage in biomolecules and atmospheric chemistry. With clock speeds of order 1 femtosecond (10^-15 s), the energy flow and correlated dance between electrons and atomic nuclei require subfemtosecond temporal resolution (e.g., 100 attosecond = 0.1 femtosecond) and carefully-designed experimental techniques to track reliably.  The University of Central Florida (UCF) - University of Maryland (UMD) collaboration has assembled the instrumentation and personnel to study such dynamics in important prototype molecules.  Specifically, charge dynamics will be probed experimentally by transient changes in the absorption spectrum of so-called core-level states (those closest to the nucleus) of the carbon atom. These novel measurements may lead to new understanding of key physical concepts, clearer pictures of fundamental processes and novel ways to control electron dynamics.   <br/><br/>Employing a few-cycle infrared intense (IR) pump and an attosecond soft X-ray probe in the water window (240 to 330 eV in this study) for transient absorption of core-level carbon atoms, the University of Central Florida (UCF) - University of Maryland (UMD) collaboration is investigating ultrafast dynamics in two important hydrocarbons.  One set of experiments is dedicated to tracking structural changes induced by the IR pulse in methane as it loses hydrogen atoms (deprotonization) with subfemtosecond temporal resolution.

One novelty of these studies rests in a forty-fold improvement in temporal resolution over previous transient absorption measurements in the water window.  The UCF-UMD collaboration is ideally suited to carry out this investigation because of the investigators' long history in building and operating state-of-the-art attosecond lasers (UCF) and probing and controlling atomic and molecular dynamics (UMD).  To ensure the best interpretation of the experimental results, the team works closely with UCF theorists running contemporary numerical codes such as XCHEM and MESA to help analyze the data.

The SM also describes most of what we know about the visible matter in the Universe.  The Higgs Boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, was the last ingredient in this theory.  Yet the overwhelming success of the SM seems only to emphasize its limitations.  There are many open questions remaining.   Why are there three families of quarks, elementary particles that make up the proton and neutron, and leptons, elementary particles such as the electron and muon? What is the nature of space-time itself?  Do the extra dimensions suggested by string theories and string- inspired models really exist? Where do dark energy and dark matter fit into our current picture of the universe? Answers to these key questions can only be found by including new physics beyond the SM. This group will work with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC to look for this new physics by searching for new particles emerging from proton-proton collisions.  An exciting feature of this program is that a number of undergraduate and Masters students from Fresno and other Cal State institutions will be involved.

The PI has considerable experience in jet physics and is well aware of the challenges this presents.

This question is central for understanding the very origin of our universe, the big bang.  Remarkable progress in understanding the big bang has occurred through the use of loop quantum cosmology (LQC), a simplified version of loop quantum gravity (LQG) for modeling the universe as a whole.  This award seeks to bridge the gap between LQC and full LQG.  Such a bridge would allow future comparisons of LQC with data to tell us exact details about the fundamental laws of quantum gravity. Bridging this gap requires answering a number of interesting fundamental conceptual questions.  A second part of this research aims to answer key questions regarding the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of loop quantum gravity, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way, and to bring this formulation closer to completion. By enabling graduate students to participate in frontier physics, and to interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term impact on the development of future scientists. The results of the research will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer reviewed publication and scientific lectures, as well as to the general public through public lectures and other means.<br/><br/>With this award, the observational, cosmological consequences of different proposals for dynamics in LQG will be studied.  To accomplish this, the PI will first find an embedding of LQC states into diffeomorphism invariant LQG states that satisfy the diffeomorphism invariant, quantum criterion for homogeneity and isotropy recently established by the PI's group. This embedding, appropriately regularized, will enable different proposals for dynamics in LQG to be translated into LQC, and thereby to distinguish their observational consequences using established methods. The task of finding the corresponding LQC dynamics will be simplified by the fact that the resulting possibilities are severely restricted by diffeomorphism invariance, as proven recently by the PI's group. The PI also plans to further develop the sum over histories approach to LQG, known as spin-foams.  In prior work of the PI, the prevailing EPRL model of spin-foams was modified to correct its semiclassical limit, yielding what is called the proper spin-foam model. Since then, other research groups have indicated how this modified model may solve a number of long-standing issues in spin-foams.  These possibilities, as well as other issues in spin-foams, will be investigated with the present award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, rigorous quantification of how life stores, processes and propagates information at the various levels of organization observed in biological systems has remained elusive. In this project the PIs will utilize recently developed information-theoretic tools from complex systems research, typically applied to artificial life systems, to assess how a real biological system manages distributed information to perform a collective computational task. This research will provide new applications of mathematical and computational tools for use by scientists and will provide important insights in issues of broader concern such as colony collapse disorder observed in honeybees. The results will be disseminated to the general public through a variety of media as part of the outreach efforts of the PI and Co-Is. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs focus on characterizing information storage, processing, and propagation in colonial decision making as a rigorous case-study for understanding the physics of collective computation in living systems. The aim is to address several outstanding questions in insect behavior, by applying a novel theoretical framework treating collective decision making as a computation to the problem of collective nest site choice by the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. To this end, the investigators will implement a novel synthesis of two levels of theoretical investigation, agent-based modeling and information-theoretic analysis of experimental and simulated data sets, with experimental manipulation to determine the mechanisms of information processing among individuals that lead to global, emergent computation in Temnothorax rugatulus colonies. With this novel framework, the PIs will address several important outstanding questions about the physics governing collective choice, including the role of negative feedback and under what conditions collective wins over individual rationality. The research will provide one of the first detailed studies expanding the wealth of knowledge on emergent computation in complex systems to the biological realm. This study will inform our understanding of fundamental aspects of biological computation that will provide new perspectives on the physics of living systems by illuminating how life stores, processes, and propagates information. Due to the ease of manipulation of individuals within eusocial-insect societies, the PIs will be able to probe the minimal set of individual-level features necessary for spontaneous distributed computation."

PWFA research has the ultimate goal of reducing the footprint, energy consumption, and cost of future particle accelerators by several orders of magnitude for applications ranging from X-ray free electron lasers to high-energy particle colliders.  Currently, no suitable diagnostics for the accelerator plasma source have been developed, and the problem approaches a research bottleneck for the field. The characterization of the plasma source must be non-intrusive and accurate to the few-percent level in order to avoid spoiling the quality of the accelerated electron beam. This necessitates the deployment of diagnostics capable of probing a macroscopic and transient plasma source with percent-level resolution, or better, which lies outside of the application of conventional plasma diagnostic systems.<br/><br/>This project will lay the groundwork for the development of an advanced, integrated system of diagnostic techniques intended to non-intrusively resolve the plasma source density profile (typical density range: 10^15 to 10^18 per cm^3) at the percent level in a single shot, with a spatial resolution of ~mm and a temporal resolution of ~ps. The individual diagnostic sub-systems will be based upon known and proven techniques that are run in tandem with one another to significantly reduce the systematic errors of the full system. The three primary diagnostic sub-systems rely on the principles of Stark broadening, Thomson scattering, and optical emission (""plasma glow""), respectively. The goals of the project are 1) to build detailed models and simulations of the expected signals for each of the diagnostic systems, 2) to test and optimize each system individually using a small, well characterized test plasma source, 3) to integrate all systems and perform simultaneous measurements of the test plasma source, and 4) to develop the analysis framework that combines the data collected by all of the diagnostic systems and minimizes the systematic errors in the recovered plasma density profile. The success of this project will point the way forward for an intended future project that incorporates an imaging spectrometer to provide a single-shot, spatially resolved plasma filament density profile. This will be combined with the use of an ultra-short laser probe pulse, and a fast-gated CCD camera to provide the best possible temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At such extraordinary conditions, atomic nuclei collapse and neutrons and protons are squeezed so tightly together that even their building blocks (quarks) may be released.  The aim of this project is to study the role of quarks for newly formed neutron stars and to identify possible signatures in astrophysical observables. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in areas of physics that are richly interdisciplinary and enrich their educational experience beyond what they learn in the classroom. Students from local middle and high schools will benefit from the PI's research in the form of public lectures and multimedia presentations. This research will support the physics program at state-of-the-art astrophysical instruments, such as FAST, skA, ATHENA, and NICER, that promise the discovery of tens of thousands of new neutron stars at different stages of their evolution.<br/><br/>The principal aim of this proposal is to study quark matter under conditions characteristic to proto-neutron stars, using the non-local 3-flavor Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (n3PNJL) model to describe hot and dense quark matter, and to explore the role of quark matter in the evolution of proto-neutron stars to neutron stars. The n3PNJL model is an effective model of quantum chromodynamics that allows for a state-of-the-art modeling of quark matter.  The model accounts for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and mimics quark confinement via the Polyakov-loop potential. It provides a versatile and numerically-treatable approach to quantum chromodynamics. The best available data from heavy-ion collisions and neutron star observations will be used to constrain the equation of state of (proto-) neutron star matter, which will be computed and made publicly available online at CompOSE and StellarCollapse.  Already existing, fully general relativistic numerical 2D rotation and 2D cooling codes will be used to study the rotational evolution of hot proto-neutron stars to cold catalyzed neutron stars self-consistently.

Wakes are observed in the bow shock of a neutron star speeding through interstellar gas, in cloud patterns as air flows past ocean islands, and behind rocks in flowing streams. Cyclists take advantage of the wake created by their teammates, riding close behind each other to conserve energy.  This research investigates the wakes formed by positively charged ions flowing past negatively charged dust particles in a complex plasma. The micron-sized dust particles in a complex (dusty) plasma have the ability to self-organize into a wide variety of structures. Much like drafting cyclists, dust particles trapped in the flowing plasma tend to line up downstream of each other.  The energy savings due to dust alignment in the wakefield has an effect on the dynamics and the stability of dust structures. Complex plasmas are an excellent system for studying dynamic effects such as structure formation, as they allow direct observation at easily accessible space and time scales. An investigation of the modes of oscillation and structural transitions in a complex plasma can also provide insight into the dynamics of other finite systems which cannot be easily imaged.<br/><br/>Many dusty plasma experiments utilize dust grains suspended in the sheath formed between the plasma and a bounding surface.  The electric fields present in the sheath accelerate the plasma ions towards the bounding surface, leading to an ion wake downstream of the grains.  The primary objective of this research is to investigate the effect of the plasma wakefield interaction on the self-organization, dynamics, and phase transitions in self-assembled dust structures within a complex plasma environment. This research merges computational and experimental techniques. A dynamic computational simulation is needed, as forces, charges, and wakes all change with particle location and the proximity of other particles. Numerical models will provide self-consistent calculations of dynamics, charging and anisotropic screening of dust particles in an ion flow. Charging and wakefield formation will be linked to the plasma environment, defining the response of the plasma to boundary conditions. At the same time, experimental techniques are needed that can produce specific particle structures in a controlled manner. Laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques designed to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and crystals with defined characteristics.  Experimentally, dust particles will also be used as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment providing data for use in the numerical models."

The accelerating charged particles are produced by the interaction of low energy (but very high intensity) laser pulses with dense jets of hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas has all of its electrons stripped off by the laser pulse, forming a plasma, and radiation pressure from the laser pulse then pushes the free electrons out of the way. This produces an electrostatic disturbance that moves as a wave in the plasma (a 'plasma wave') and is so strong that it can accelerate its own electrons from rest to nearly the speed of light in the form of directed beams. These beams of accelerated electrons are useful for medical and scientific imaging. One of their intriguing, exciting, and potentially useful byproducts is radiation flash emission, which takes place over just one half cycle of the radiation emission itself, making it of sub-femtosecond duration (less than 1/1000000000000000 second long). Such a light source, in addition to its fascinating internal relativistic dynamics, can act as the fastest-ever optical strobe source for capturing images, for example, of electrons in mid-flight in their orbits in an atom.<br/><br/>This project will develop and characterize a new source of intense, coherent, sub-femtosecond pulses (or flashes) in the optical range. These pulses arise directly from wave breaking of relativistic plasma waves and are only indirectly driven by a pump laser field. The radiation flash appears to arise purely from classical acceleration of charged particles exposed to the enormous electric and magnetic fields inside relativistic plasma waves. Their spectral and coherence characteristics are strongly affected by the plasma density, which sets the group velocity of the plasma waves, the spatial scale of the radiating bunches, and the laser energy required for relativistic self-focusing of the initiating laser pulse. Such flashes are consistent with unidirectional acceleration of electrons from rest to nearly the speed of light.  The project will consist of detailed measurements of flash coherence properties, temporal pulse structure, and exploration of timing control of this radiation. Accompanying the experiments will be extensive 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations. A new 1 kHz, 10 mJ laser system will enable experiments at a much higher repetition rate, improving shot-to-shot reproducibility and allowing high data collection rates, both of which lead to better signal-to-noise and more precise measurements."

Protons and neutrons, in turn, are made of quarks, which are held together by what is known as the strong nuclear force. However, how the strong force holds the quarks together is still one of the most puzzling questions in physics. It is in our national interest to answer this question as it will advance our knowledge about one of the fundamental aspects of nature, namely the origin and structure of matter. This project will develop new techniques that will shed light on the nature of the strong nuclear force.  In general, this force is poorly understood primarily because the theory that explains it, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD), has a complex mathematical structure.  Professor Anber seeks to modify QCD by adding new deformations that will make it possible to study the strong force by analytical means.  This research project will also have significant broader impacts on undergraduate students and the broader community. Professor Anber will recruit highly motivated students to collaborate with him, making special efforts to reach out to women and underrepresented minorities. Professor Anber will also design two courses on field theory and computational physics, and several meaningful examples from his research will be brought to the classroom. In addition, he will present the results of his research in workshops and conferences and will give talks at other universities and liberal-arts colleges. The undergraduate students who will participate in the proposed research will disseminate their contributions through talks and posters in conferences. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Anber proposes to deform QCD by compactifying QCD on a circle and/or adding matter in various representations, which introduces an infrared cutoff that brings the theory into a weakly coupled regime and makes it amenable to semi-classical treatment. The deformed theory is not the real world. It is hoped, however, that by studying this class of models, one will gain new insights into real-world QCD. Surprisingly enough, studies of this class of theories have shown that various physical observables have the same qualitative behavior both in the strongly- and weakly-coupled regimes, suggesting continuity between weakly- and strongly-coupled theories. This conjectured continuity is tantalizing. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of this continuity, and ample evidence in support of or even against it has to be collected before such an understanding can be reached. The proposed research program will enhance our understanding of the structure of compactified gauge theories and inform us about the limitations of and/or reasons behind the conjectured continuity. The proposed study aims to (1) classify all confining gauge theories on a circle and understand the structure of the molecular instantons that form in the vacuum of this class of theories, (2) study the phase diagram of thermal gauge theories on a circle, (3) track the behavior of physical observables as we decompactify the circle, and (4) compare and contrast the topological field theories that describe the extended objects (confining strings) in the weakly- and strongly-coupled regimes. Confronting the results of the proposed study with the available lattice data may yield a new perspective on the structure of confining gauge theories."

A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.

The discovery of a nEDM would imply a violation of time reversal invariance and a violation of charge-parity symmetry that, depending on its magnitude, has implications for the particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the universe. Measurements of the particle electric dipole moment provide some of the tightest constraints on extensions to the Standard Model.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter.  The LHC is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson, and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC has as one of its primary functions to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will contribute to the upgrade necessary to handle the higher energy of the newly-restarted LHC and to analyze data from the CMS experiment to look for BSM physics through the search for two candidate theoretical particles for BSM physics, a heavy charged Higgs boson and the so-called Wprime particle. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. The physics studies enabled by this award are the searches for Wprime and Heavy Charged Higgs, two candidate theoretical particles for BSM physics. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."

Their findings extend our understanding of the universe, and inspire the next generation of scientists. The process of parameter estimation requires that the observed wave be compared to many millions of gravitational waves generated by theoretical models. However, this poses a major challenge: the software currently used for this task is far too slow, requiring up to 1,000 years to estimate parameters for a single detected gravitational wave. This grant will support an effort to improve this software platform performance by a factor of 10,000, which will greatly increase the usefulness of this state-of-the-art and widely-used model for LSC parameter estimation. The grant will also support the implementation of an automated software validation system for the LSC, to prevent certain types of software ""bugs"" from influencing parameter estimation.<br/><br/>For cases where the sources of interest are spinning black-hole pairs, the LSC primarily makes use of two highly-reliable theoretical models based on supercomputer-generated solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity. One of these models is called SEOBNRv3 (short for Spinning Effective One Body-Numerical Relativity model, version 3). The SEOBNR series of gravitational waveform models are among the best available for parameter estimation (PE) of spinning black-hole binaries, filling gaps in perturbative waveform approximants with results from numerical relativity simulations. Despite their great efficiency and reliability when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, SEOBNR codes are still far too slow to be directly useful for standard Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based PE.

By monitoring the change in velocity for atoms due to absorbing or emitting light, this team will measure a fundamental constant of nature known as the fine structure constant. The experiments will be performed with an atomic gas that is cooled to very low temperatures in the laboratory, at which point it transforms into an exotic state called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Like a laser beam, the BEC can be split into multiple parts and then recombined, to make an interferometer for atoms.  By observing BEC interference fringes, this team will precisely measure the velocity change for atoms due to absorbing or emitting light quanta (photons). The results will provide information regarding possible refinements to the underlying theory of quantum mechanics that describes this fundamental process.  The students working on this project will gain experience with lasers, electronics, and atomic physics research.  The students will also gain experience analyzing data, modeling complex systems, and connecting experimental results with theory. This will form good preparation for them to join the work force in academia and industry as part of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  <br/> <br/>The kinetic energy of an atom recoiling due to absorption of a single photon will be precisely measured as a frequency.  This will be done using the contrast interferometry technique with a ytterbium BEC interferometer.  This recoil frequency, combined with other measurements, will be used to accurately determine the fine structure constant, and to test the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The fine structure constant is ubiquitous in nature, and QED theory extends across many sub-fields throughout physics. Improving the accuracy with which the fine structure constant is known and the precision with which QED is tested are both of fundamental importance. The contrast interferometer utilizes pulsed optical standing waves to split, manipulate, and recombine BECs. The interferometer signal is obtained by monitoring the contrast of the resultant interference pattern via reflection of an optical traveling wave. In addition to testing QED, this project will also advance BEC preparation, manipulation, and probing methods."

This research studies double photoionization of water molecules in which a single photon ejects two electrons.  A sophisticated measurement method is used in which the ejected electrons and the ionic fragments are detected in coincidence to determine how they share energy and in which direction they move away from each other.  The details of those measurements will help theoretical physicists refine quantum mechanical models of molecules that absorb ionizing radiation.

The characteristic timescale of this lifetime is determined by the laws of nature, and is one of the fundamental properties of the molecule.  It is typically a few tens of nanoseconds (billionths of a second).  The lifetime of sodium molecules is  measured in this project using very precisely pulsed lasers in a technique called ""time-resolved spectroscopy."" When the lasers are pulsed on, a high-speed electronic stopwatch is switched on to record the amount of time that lapses between the absorption and the emission of the photon. The data obtained has applications in fields such as astrophysics (determining what kind of molecules are in space and how they formed), plasma physics (determining the temperatures of very hot materials), and laser physics (helping to predict what materials could be used to make better lasers). <br/><br/>This project focuses on experimental studies of radiative lifetime measurements (for a variety of rotational quantum numbers) of the excited ion-pair state of sodium molecules from direct fluorescence decay using a time-resolved spectroscopic technique.  Sodium molecules can exhibit exotic behavior since their structural and radiative properties vary strongly as a function of internuclear distance.  This is due to the effect of the ion pair character, which causes the formation of double well in the molecular potential energy curves. Recently, the radiative lifetimes of some of the ion-pair states of sodium molecules have been calculated and mapped out. This provides benchmark values against which the reliability of recent theoretical approaches can be tested in the laboratory. Measurements of excited state lifetimes play an important role in understanding the interplay between molecular potential energies, molecular electronic structure, and related quantities such as transition probabilities, oscillator strengths, and line intensities. The experimental approach is to create sodium molecules in a heatpipe oven and excite them by a two-step laser double resonance excitation to reach the ion-pair state. Molecular fluorescence detection, atomic fluorescence detection from dissociating molecules (a process which happens on different time scale than molecular radiative timescale), and polarization of atomic fluorescence from predissociating molecule will be measured. If a dissociated molecule is detected, polarization measurement will provide detail information about the nonadiabatic dynamics of the predissociation process. Thus, the time-resolved spectroscopic technique provides a tool for studying the intramolecular vibrational energy distribution in molecules and the dynamics of atomic motion in a molecule."

It is surprising that we do not better understand how electrons work together. This award supports studies of a novel substance, an ultracold gas of strongly interacting atoms, which behaves in many ways like electrons. For example, just like a metal becomes ""superconducting"" at low temperatures and starts to conduct electricity without resistance, the atomic gas becomes ""superfluid"" and atoms flow without friction. However, scaled to the density of electrons in metals, superfluidity would occur in the atomic gas already far above room temperature, thanks to the strong interatomic interactions. Just like electrons, but also protons and neutrons, the atoms belong to the class of particles called fermions, which cannot share one and the same state. This requirement makes computations extremely difficult and experiments indispensable to learn about the behavior of fermions. Confined in an artificial ""box"" of light, the atomic Fermi gas will be a pristine platform to learn about the equation of state of strongly interacting fermions, as they occur in modern materials, for example high-temperature superconductors, but also in neutron stars and nuclear matter. With the help of these and other studies, we might be led to an understanding on how to realize room temperature superconductivity. The project also holds the potential for observing new states of fermionic matter such as a supersolid--a superfluid that is also ordered like a crystal. The research will present a stimulating learning experience for graduate students.<br/><br/>Ultracold Fermi gases of atoms represent a paradigmatic form of fermionic matter, where all details of the interparticle interaction, the external confinement, and the spin composition are precisely known and under the control of the experimenter. This project employs a Fermi gas of Lithium-6 atoms to try to answer long-standing questions about 1) the thermodynamics of two- and three-dimensional systems, 2) the fate of fermionic superfluidity in the presence of spin imbalance and 3) non-equilibrium dynamics in fermionic superfluids. The Fermi gas will be confined in tailored potentials, in particular a homogeneous box potential and a hybrid harmonic-box potential. Creating a homogeneous Fermi gas will take away many of the existing experimental limitations in obtaining accurate thermodynamic information. The box potential allows accessing new phases of fermionic matter that have not been observed before. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid in two dimensions features algebraic order that would be masked in an inhomogeneous trap. A homogeneous 3D Fermi superfluid in the presence of spin imbalance should spontaneously break translational symmetry by forming a train of solitons, where excess fermions reside in the nodes of the order parameter. This describes the famous Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state, a supersolid phase of matter that has not been conclusively observed despite five decades of research. In the present work, soliton trains will be directly created in the presence of spin imbalance, thereby engineering the LO state."

Rydberg highly charged ions, in which the remaining electron is in a highly excited state, will be the focus of this project. These systems provide test beds for measurement of fundamental constants, quantum information processing schemes, precision tests of quantum electrodynamics, and precision X-ray wavelength standards.

Light-induced charge dynamics, for example, is ubiquitous in catalysis, photosynthesis, the photovoltaic effect, radiation damage in biomolecules and atmospheric chemistry. With clock speeds of order 1 femtosecond (10^-15 s), the energy flow and correlated dance between electrons and atomic nuclei require subfemtosecond temporal resolution (e.g., 100 attosecond = 0.1 femtosecond) and carefully-designed experimental techniques to track reliably.  The University of Central Florida (UCF) - University of Maryland (UMD) collaboration has assembled the instrumentation and personnel to study such dynamics in important prototype molecules.  Specifically, charge dynamics will be probed experimentally by transient changes in the absorption spectrum of so-called core-level states (those closest to the nucleus) of the carbon atom. These novel measurements may lead to new understanding of key physical concepts, clearer pictures of fundamental processes and novel ways to control electron dynamics.   <br/><br/>Employing a few-cycle infrared intense (IR) pump and an attosecond soft X-ray probe in the water window (240 to 330 eV in this study) for transient absorption of core-level carbon atoms, the University of Central Florida (UCF) - University of Maryland (UMD) collaboration is investigating ultrafast dynamics in two important hydrocarbons.  One set of experiments is dedicated to tracking structural changes induced by the IR pulse in methane as it loses hydrogen atoms (deprotonization) with subfemtosecond temporal resolution. The second study focuses on IR-induced isomerization of acetylene into vinilydene also with subfemtosecond resolution.  One novelty of these studies rests in a forty-fold improvement in temporal resolution over previous transient absorption measurements in the water window.  The UCF-UMD collaboration is ideally suited to carry out this investigation because of the investigators' long history in building and operating state-of-the-art attosecond lasers (UCF) and probing and controlling atomic and molecular dynamics (UMD).  To ensure the best interpretation of the experimental results, the team works closely with UCF theorists running contemporary numerical codes such as XCHEM and MESA to help analyze the data.

The theory of Classical Mechanics tells us how bridges, cars, and all parts that make up the objects in our everyday world, behave at a macroscopic scale. Unifying the two in a smooth way, to arrive at a consistent theory of both the microscopic and macroscopic scales is an unsolved problem (the ""Quantum Measurement Problem"") that has perplexed scientists for about one century. To solve this problem, objects at an intermediate scale, in between the microscopic and macroscopic, need to be studied. This is what the project: ""Coherent Electron Control"" is aiming to do. Electrons are placed close to a controllable amount of material in a wall, so that the description of how the two interact is neither easily described by Quantum Mechanics, nor Classical Mechanics. The best provisional description available, which is called decoherence theory, can be tested to its limits in this way. On the practical side, the interaction between electrons and walls has stopped the development of sensitive devices based on electrons, called electron interferometers. The walls destroy the useful quantum mechanical properties of the electrons. If this ""decoherence"" can be overcome, electron devices can be constructed that measure small changes in magnetic fields, and may thus assist, for example, in the detection of submerged submarines that distort the Earth's magnetic field. <br/><br/>Nanofabricated gratings are used as devices that split electron beams into two parts. These two parts are recombined and show quantum mechanical interference. Walls of doped silicon, gold, and other materials such as graphene and superconductive materials will be placed close to the electron beams used to decohere the electron beams, which causes the quantum mechanical interference to disappear. Four different existing microscopic theories can be tested by the experimental data that will be collected; decoherence theory is an integral part of all four.  The knowledge gained will be used to control and reduce the decoherence and be applied to enlarge the size of existing electron interferometers. In this way it will be attempted to construct the largest and most sensitive electron interferometer in the world. This research project provides experience to graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students in the new research area of free electron quantum optics."

Quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the microscopic world--elementary particles, atoms, molecules, photons and so on--allows particles to be at many places at the same time, a property called superposition. If several particles are in a superposition state, then their individual properties may become ""entangled"" in such a way that detecting one of the particles will affect the other particles even though there is no direct physical connection between them. Dubbed ""spooky action at a distance"" by Albert Einstein, this property has no classical physics analog, and its understanding is essential for verifying the validity of quantum mechanics. This seemingly esoteric property also has important practical applications and implications for a rapidly developing new technology: quantum computation and quantum communication. Quantum computers should be able to break computational speed records using exotic algorithms; their very existence requires strong quantum entanglement between the quantum bits, or ""qubits"", which form the basis of their operation. Quantum communication channels can transmit data with the highest possible levels of security; the reliability and range of these channels depends crucially on the ability to generate entanglement.<br/><br/>The PI's will use trapped Ba ion qubits and the ion-photon entanglement protocol to generate long distance entanglement between the ions. The long (~1 km) range is needed to close both the locality loophole (which requires the measurements on the two qubits to be outside of each other's light cone) and the detection, or fair sampling, loophole (which requires that the detection efficiency is high) in the same experiment. The photons emitted by the ions will be sent though optical fibers and measured in a partial Bell state analyzer, a process which in turn entangles the distant ions via entanglement swapping."

In contrast, the cores of compact stars are so dense that a tiny box containing neutron-star matter would have a mass of about 13 million tons. Neutrons in such a dense medium get so squeezed that the quarks inside them become liberated. Quite often this stellar dense matter will be also subjected to very large magnetic fields. A special class of neutron stars, known as magnetars, can have surface magnetic fields that are fifteen orders of magnitude stronger than the magnetic field of the Sun and even much stronger fields in the core. In this context, an important goal of the nuclear theory community is to understand the phases of matter under extreme conditions in order to make theoretical predictions that can then be compared with observational data and experimental measurements made on Earth. In particular, this project will explore the properties of matter under extreme conditions by studying results from heavy-ion collision experiments carried out at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Experiments at RHIC produce matter at temperatures a thousand times hotter than the Sun and magnetic fields eighteen orders of magnitude stronger than the Sun's magnetic field.

This project will investigate some of these problems. The PI and his collaborators will use nonperturbative methods in quantum field theory to investigate the influence of a magnetic field on the transport properties of quark matter at high temperatures and low densities (in the QGP phase); and at high densities and low temperatures, where the spatially inhomogeneous phase known as the Dual Chiral Density Wave phase and axion electrodynamics are realized. To carry out this project, the PI will formulate the kinematics of relativistic plasmas with anomalous transport associated with a Berry curvature produced by quark quasiparticles with asymmetric spectra. In addition, the PI will extend recent work on inverse magnetic catalysis in the weak-coupling limit to the strong-coupling regime case to complete the analogy between analytical calculations beyond the mean-field approximation and lattice QCD results. These studies will give new insights on probing the microscopic physics of high dense quark matter through macroscopically observable signatures. These studies will help establish connections between nuclear physics, condensed matter, and astrophysics."

Such a candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum Chromodynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. The Axion Resonant InterAction DetectioN Experiment (ARIADNE) is designed to search for axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions between nuclei at sub-millimeter ranges. The experiment involves a rotating non-magnetic mass to source the axion field, and a dense ensemble of laser-polarized He-3 nuclei to detect the axion field by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. <br/><br/>While participating in this research, a team of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate researchers will be broadly trained in the techniques of experimental atomic physics, optical pumping, nuclear magnetic resonance, low-temperature physics, micro-fabrication, magnetic shielding, vacuum systems, and modeling. This will be valuable preparation for work in basic or applied research, either in the U.S. or international work force or scientific community.<br/><br/>The signal from an axion field can be resonantly enhanced by properly modulating the axion potential at the nuclear spin precession frequency. The goal of this award is to complete construction of the experiment, bring it through its commissioning phase during which possible systematics will be evaluated, and start the early data taking stage, exploring new parameter space for the PQ axion. The method has the potential to improve previous experimental and astrophysical bounds on axions by several orders of magnitude and probe deep into the theoretically interesting regime for the PQ axion. The experiment is also sensitive to more exotic axion-like particles. The new method can ultimately exceed present laboratory constraints on spin-dependent short-range forces by up to 8 orders of magnitude and can improve on the combined laboratory/astrophysical limits by a factor of 10^4 in the axion mass range of ma between 10 micro-eV and 10 milli-eV, probing deep into the traditional ""PQ-axion window"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize the full potential of this approach and determine the supramolecular structures of protein complexes, as well as their relative concentrations, dynamics and spatial distributions Inside a cell or tissue, one must obtain three pieces of critical information at image pixel level: the concentrations of donor and acceptor molecules, and the FRET efficiency occurring between the two. Acquiring this information necessitates exciting the sample at two distinct wavelengths. Existing laser-scanning microscopes (including confocal, two-photon, and FLIM microscopes) perform two-wavelength excitation scans in a serial fashion. This leads to a long time delay (10-100 s) between the two successive scans on a pixel level. As membrane proteins can diffuse in and out of a pixel within 0.100 s, the two excitations are scanning different molecules, thereby compromising the molecular-level resolution. Furthermore, reducing the number of molecules per pixel requires increased spatial resolution, which is not available using current FLIM, confocal, or two-photon microscope technologies.  Availability of this cutting-edge technology will open up a new avenue of research in cell signaling and provide an untapped source of pharmacological targets, which in turn may improve public health. The design of the instrument will be made available to other researchers, while the instrument itself will be made available for use by interested research groups. We will also partner with US companies to bring this instrument to the market. Besides to impacting the research programs of investigators around the nation and abroad, the proposed instrument will provide exquisite training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate trainees in interdisciplinary research across the boundaries between biology, biochemistry, pharmacology and physics. This instrument also will be used for new education initiatives developed by the PI, which bring practical applications of physical and mathematical concepts to elementary and high school students as well as college freshmen, including underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>In this proposed instrument development project, we will design and construct a two-photon optical micro-spectroscope capable of quasi-parallel excitation of tens of focal spots spread in one or two dimensions, and rapid switching between two different excitation wavelengths. This instrument will present several advantages over existing ones: (1) The parallel excitation of multiple sample voxels will lead to dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio of 20X to 100X compared with single point-scan microscopes. (2) Spectrally resolved fluorescence will be collected at two excitation wavelengths separated by 10 ms; this switching time is 100-1000X faster than existing technology and will enable the currently unattainable determination of the localization of differently sized oligomeric species together with their size distribution (e.g., monomers, dimers, tetramers) on a pixel level. (3) Finally, this instrument will present both reduced out-of-focus blur and increased axial resolution (by about 2X) compared to existing two-photon microscopes. The dramatic improvement in temporal and spatial resolution as well as data accuracy will provide biologists with a means to determine how protein oligomerization and function affect one another. The multidisciplinary team assembled by the PI is ideally suited to develop and validate this technology, since it combines exquisite technical expertise, facilities, experience with developing and running an imaging facility, and close collaborations between physicists, biologists and other life scientists."

These data are needed to understand astrophysically important systems and processes such as neutron rich matter, neutron stars, supernovae, and r-process nucleosynthesis and neutrino scattering.  The quantum many-particle methods developed within this project have broad applications across many areas of physics. These include the nuclear physics aspects directly relating to the project, cold atomic gas research, and electronic structure. Methods previously developed within this project have been applied in each of these areas.  The project will train both undergraduate and graduate students, give them exposure at national and international conferences, and provide for dissemination of the results.<br/><br/>This project will continue work developing and using accurate techniques to calculate the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter using quantum Monte Carlo methods, i.e. stochastic sampling methods for the large number of quantum degrees of freedom. A primary aim is to develop auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo methods to sample both the space and spin-isospin degrees of freedom of protons and neutrons in nuclei with all important parts of the nuclear interaction.  These include both the spin-orbit and three-body interactions. New wave functions which can be efficiently evaluated for nuclei are being developed, with the goal of obtaining accurate properties for medium to large and neutron rich nuclei. Superfluidity has major consequences in neutron star matter. The investigator and his students will use the same methods to study both the nuclear systems and the related phenomena in cold atomic gases. Many of the pairing and superfluid mechanisms important in nuclei and nuclear matter can be studied and verified in these systems where detailed experimental measurements can be made using table-top experimental setups."

One direction for improving the security of future information systems is to utilize quantum communication lines. Based on laws of nature, such lines do not allow non-traceable copying of the information transmitted. But the same physics that makes them secure (i.e. the non-cloning theorem) also forbids the use of classical repeaters, which in turn limits communication distance and speed. This issue may be overcome by using quantum repeaters, the key ingredient of which is a quantum memory device.  The aim of this project is to develop a novel solid-state quantum memory based on quantum states of color centers in diamond.  This project will utilize theoretical and experimental advances developed at Texas A&M University both for the memory access protocol and for its physical implementation.  This research project will strengthen the US presence in the field of optical ensemble-based solid-state quantum memories. It will also help train the next generation of scientists in this dynamically developing interdisciplinary field of research. Graduate and undergraduate students will get involved in the investigations through participation in the experiments, developing theoretical models, programming, collecting and interpreting experimental data, and numerical simulations. The investigators will also incorporate the obtained results into courses.<br/><br/>This project focuses on new color centers, namely, Germanium Vacancies and Silicon Vacancies in diamond (GeV and SiV) for pioneering experimental realization of an ensemble based broadband quantum memory in diamond. This realization will be achieved using a new approach to quantum memory based on a discrete spatial chirp of a control field that has recently been suggested by the co-PIs. The outcome of this work, a single-photon solid-state interface, will be a milestone on the way to a scalable universal optical quantum computer. In comparison to existing technologies, like rare-earth doped crystals and nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond (NV), SiV and GeV have stronger optical interaction and less spectral diffusion (and inhomogeneous linewidths). The stronger zero-phonon line gives more efficient interaction of a single photon with a single silicon-vacancy, while a narrow inhomogeneous line broadening favors ensemble-based quantum memories. Other advantages of GeV and SiV are the presence of polarization selection rules and large (160 GHz and 50 GHz accordingly) energy level splitting in the ground state. The last one allows for large storage bandwidth. It is worth pointing out that multi-GHz vs MHz bandwidth is a key advantage of an optical over RF quantum networks (i.e. superconducting circuits (SCC)). The only disadvantage of GeV and SiV is a shorter electron-spin coherence time. However, it has been shown that this can be dramatically increased, up to 13 ms, by cooling SiV down to 100 mK.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This experiment will address the proton-radius puzzle by scattering muons and electrons off the proton.  Through detector development, simulations, management of complex experiments, and data analyses, they will shed light on some of the most profound questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon?  What are and how can we excite its internal degrees of freedom?  Once excited, in which way does the nucleon decay back to its original state?  Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter?  The experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying theory."

The GW signals observed so far have been short-lived, and from the final stages of black holes and neutron stats orbiting into one another.  This project is aimed at detection of long-lived GWs from rapidly spinning neutron stars, extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city, spinning tens to hundreds of times every second.  The main targets for this search are neutron stars in binary orbits with lower-mass stars.  The neutron stars attract material from their companions, which powers their rotation and emits X-rays, allowing a multimessenger analysis.<br/><br/>This project will involve faculty and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology, who will broaden the multimessenger effort to search for GWs from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in several ways: 1) ensuring the search for Scorpius X-1, the brightest LMXB, is as sensitive as possible with algorithmic improvements and mock data validation, 2) expanding the search to other LMXBs, and 3) implementing a hierarchical followup to existing searches for unknown neutron stars in binary systems.  The group will also enhance the sensitivity of a variety of continuous-wave searches by incorporating an improved detection statistic into the LSC algorithm library.  The search for the Sco X-1, as well as accreting binaries J1751-305, Cygnus X-3, and 4U 1636-536, is considered a highest priority by the LIGO scientific collaboration, and this award will be instrumental in maximizing its success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such merger of two neutron stars has recently been observed in gravitational waves and across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Astronomers now know that such events happen and that they release tremendous amounts of radiation and material, but exactly how this release happens in a merger aftermath remains unclear. Numerical simulations that include general relativity are the only way to predict how merger processes unfold, but these simulations are made incredibly difficult by the presence of turbulence, which creates fluid flow and magnetic field features across a wide range of length scales.  Small-scale flows do drive changes in the merger remnant at large scales and so cannot be ignored.  Although computer simulations cannot yet directly capture all of this dynamics, a great deal can be learned with current computing capabilities by parameterized exploration of unresolved small-scale effects and post-merger initial states.  This project will pursue these strategies to shed light on how these exotic and violent events produce their outflows and radiation.  Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events.<br/><br/>The Washington State University will study three core problems of numerical relativity--inspiraling binaries, differentially rotating neutron stars, and hyperaccreting black holes--using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino transport.  Inspiral simulations will study equation of state effects on gravitational waves, and improvements to evolution algorithms and smooth, causal equation of state parameterizations will be explored.  Post-merger dynamics of NSNS systems will be modeled, focusing on the case of a hypermassive neutron star remnant.  Simulations will track the secular evolution to collapse under the influence of neutrino radiation, large-scale magnetic fields, and subgrid-scale turbulence.  Finally, neutrino effects around black hole-torus systems will be analyzed using neutrino transport methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying the mechanisms that generate matter flows at the edge of rapidly rotating black holes and how the electromagnetic fields originate and organize in space can significantly advance our knowledge in mathematical physics, gravitation, and astrophysics. Recent measurements suggest that nearly extremal (i.e., spinning at almost the maximum theoretical limit) black holes exist in nature, and consequently nearly extremal black holes could be detected in future astrophysical experiments. The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) model - a mechanism for electromagnetic energy extraction from a rotating black hole - is considered to be the most promising framework to explain the energy observed in quasars and, as the numerical simulations indicate, the most efficient way to extract energy from a rotating black hole. In spite of these findings, few theoretical works have systematically addressed the BZ energy extraction mechanisms for (near-)extremal black holes, and it still remains difficult to develop an intuitive picture of how the electromagnetic fields originate and organize in space. It is the overall aim of this project to amend this situation.<br/><br/>This award supports research on relativistic outflow mechanisms near Kerr black holes. Firstly, it will provide BZ models with a general theoretical framework by constructing an action principle for the electromagnetic fields. Secondly, it will study the genesis of energy extraction in black hole by defining the solution space and domain of operation at the edge of (near-)extreme black holes. Lastly, it will develop an intuitive picture of how the flow of electromagnetic energy and charge current originates and organizes in space by finding extensions and novel solutions of the newly discovered purely electromagnetic version of the BZ process. Realizing these proposed goals will open a new window on the study of general relativity in the strong field regime and outflow processes at the edge of black holes. Combined with the unprecedented observational data that will soon become available the present interdisciplinary theoretical research has the potential to radically enhance our knowledge of the fundamental theory and to impact the astronomical measurements of spinning black holes."

The weak nuclear force is important because it powers our sun and helps determine the abundance of elements in the universe.  Neutron decay in particular is important because it plays a key role in the formation of helium in the early universe.  Additionally, neutron decay involves only a single nucleon and that makes it possible to calculate very precise predictions from the Standard Model of fundamental particles and interactions without complications from other nucleons.  With very accurate measurements of neutron decay, we can perform a kind of particle physics forensics, looking for discrepancies in the Standard Model that can indicate the presence of new forces but without using high energy particle beams.  This research is a part of the ""precision frontier"" for physics, and defines the cutting edge of our knowledge of the weak nuclear force and possible new interactions.<br/>An important aspect of this research is the training of students and post-docs.  This contributes to the spreading of technical methods and expertise.   This training comes from the specific nature of the projects, which use nuclear physics analysis and technology, and from the many opportunities students have to perform research at our national laboratories and nuclear facilities. Some of the techniques used have real-world applications in energy generation and medical imaging.<br/><br/> <br/>One of the experiments supported by this award, Nab, will use an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons at the Spallation Neutron Source from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to measure the angular correlation between the decay electron and the neutrino, with the goal of improving the precision of this correlation by over an order of magnitude improvement.  The other two experiments, UCNA and UCNtau, are situated at the ultracold neutron (UCN) source at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The UCNA experiment measures the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the decay electron momentum (called the beta-asymmetry), and aims for a factor of 3 improvement over the precision of the global data set for the axial form factor. UCNtau is designed to measure the lifetime of the neutron, with the goal of a 1 second uncertainty during the proposal period.  These programs will impact: (1) knowledge of the axial form factor at the level required for a the establishment of the CKM matrix element Vud from the neutron at the same level as the super-allowed decays, (2) knowledge of the neutron lifetime at a level such that it will not limit tests of cosmological 4He abundance models for some time, and (3) limits on tensor couplings at or above the level expected from CERN.  For each of these experiments, the group brings its experience in beta decay measurements to bear on key sources of systematic error by developing instrumentation and analysis required by the experiments."

This model succeeded in classifying all the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has.  One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC, which remains the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator, operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project will analyze data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of beyond the Standard Model. The work that will be accomplished with this award will impact three broad areas: 1) Upgrading the highly technical components of the CMS detector 2) workforce development and outreach to the broader community and 3) furthering the analysis techniques that might well discover new physics at the LHC. With the strong cooperative education program at Northeastern University, the group will continue to routinely involve undergraduates in meaningful six-month projects at CERN. The PIs will also continue their involvement with the Boston Area QuarkNet group (now in its 14th year) where they are able to reach out to local high school teachers and their students. The group members also share the excitement and knowledge of the discoveries and results with the broader public through lectures and presentations to audiences outside of particle physics. <br/><br/>The work funded through this award will search for a number of new particle physics sectors where there are theoretical models of beyond the SM physics. A discovery of leptoquarks would provide a link between the quark sector and the lepton sectors and help to explain why both sectors contain three generations of matter. Detection of substantial invisible decays of the Higgs boson would answer important questions about the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Invisible decays of the Higgs are a signature of various beyond the standard model physics theories. In these, the Higgs can interact with new heavy particles which decay into particles that are usually not detected by the experiment (like neutrinos). Limits on the invisible decay rate of the Higgs boson also provide constraints on models of Dark Matter. This project's studies also include measurements of the differential cross section measurements of Standard Model processes, such as ZZ production, and W+jets production, that have sensitivity to new physics. These studies are tightly coupled with the new physics searches because the processes they measure are important backgrounds to the specific searches targeted. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics."

The PI will address two problems in cancer research: (a) how the interplay of distinct types of somatic mutations impacts tumor evolution and (b) what is the mechanism of origin of tumor heterogeneity. Solutions to these problems, which are relevant to all cancers, using physics-based models and analytical tools based on concepts in glass physics will be sought. The outcome of this work will provide a quantitative and integrated picture of a few key important issues in cancer research. The results will provide a platform for analyzing clinical data, as the initial studies already demonstrate. The PI will provide training of the next generation of students and postdoctoral research fellows in the area of theoretical research on cancer in which physics concepts and quantitative methods will play an increasing role. The training of these scientists will include sustained efforts to integrate the field of glass physics into cancer research.<br/><br/>Two major issues will be investigated: (1) Role of beneficial passenger or mini-drivers mutations on cancer progression: According to the somatic mutation theory, cancer is caused by clonal expansion of cells due to accumulation of mutations over a life time that gives fitness advantage to tumor cells. Much of the focus has been on driver mutations as the cause of cancer, and very little attention has been paid to passenger mutation. The PI will use models that consider the interplay of driver mutations as well as deleterious and beneficial passenger mutations to obtain quantitative predictions for tumor evolution and cancer dormancy in terms of mutation rates, population size, and fitness of mutation types. (2) Physical models for Cancer Heterogeneity: There is a resurgent interest in understanding the origin of non-genetic cancer heterogeneity, although its importance in affecting cancer therapy was appreciated decades ago. Clarifying the origin of heterogeneity requires creating three dimensional models accounting for the birth and death of cells. In addition, the proposed models must include physical inter cellular forces, allowing us to quantify tumor microenvironment and its evolution with realistic dynamics. The PI will use two models that explicitly account for both spatial migration (characteristic of cells that have lost or have reduced E-cadherin expression) and adhesive forces as found in epithelial cells. The PI suggests that some of the theoretical concepts rooted in glass physics are necessary to fully understand cancer heterogeneity. The expected results will not only bridge the two fields but also provide a way to describe quantitatively the migration of cancer cells from their sites of origin to distant sites."

The results of atomic collisions research are widely used in fields such as plasma physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and many other areas. In addition to providing a better overall understanding of heavy-ion collisions, which is the principal focus of the effort, this work will bring a well-known technique from other areas of physics into atomic and molecular collisions research, and possibly lead to additional overlap and collaborations between the atomic collisions community and other related fields. Another important aspect of this project is the inclusion of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. By participating in this project, students will gain valuable hands-on research experience through code development and data analysis. They will also present their results at regional and national conferences, which will hopefully give them a more global view of scientific research.<br/><br/>The few-body problem is one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in physics. When more than two particles interact through the Coulomb force, the dynamics of the system cannot be described exactly. As a result, theory must resort to approximations, and any discrepancies that result between theory and experiment must be a result of the approximations. A comparison of current theoretical models with recent experimental results reveals some striking limitations of the current models. In particular, the dynamics of collisions in which some of the collision fragments are found in a full 3-dimensional geometry is not understood. The underlying mechanism behind these 3-dimensional collisions is known to be a result of quantum mechanical effects, but current theories cannot accurately describe the collision dynamics. The objective of this project is to develop a novel quantum mechanical theoretical model for the study of ion-impact atomic collisions through the use of the path integral technique. The path integral method is a well-known technique used in other areas of physics, but has not been applied to the study of heavy-ion collisions. This particular technique will allow for the inclusion of important quantum mechanical interactions, as well as provide an intuitive understanding of particle trajectories during the collision. <br/><br/>The technical details of the project include the development of a computational model using the path integral method for ionization and capture processes with heavy-ion projectiles. The method will utilize an expansion of the Lagrangian around the classical path, where the deviation from the classical path represents the quantum fluctuations of the particle. For electron capture collisions, the role of the projectile-nuclear interaction and target electron correlation will be studied. Electron capture collisions with high projectile energy and large scattering angle will also be studied with the objective of better understanding the Thomas mechanism, and determining if possible diffraction effects exist in these collisions. For ionization processes, collisions in which the ejected electron is found outside of the scattering plane will be studied, with a focus on projectile-nuclear interactions and the role of close collisions between the projectile and the target nucleus."

With a realistic discovery potential, XENON100 has already reached a world-leading sensitivity, and continues to accrue data at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy towards its ultimate sensitivity reach.

The worldwide race towards direct dark matter detection has been dramatically accelerated by the remarkable progress and evolution of LXeTPCs. They have shifted the scale of target mass from a few to tens of kilograms whilst simultaneously reducing both electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds to extremely low levels.

This phenomenon, called chemotaxis, in the E. coli bacteria is one of the most extensively studied biological response. The E. coli chemotaxis network has become a paradigm for cellular behavior and signal transduction pathways and in this project the PI aims to understand signaling and behavior in E. coli considering them in the context of their function and the specific challenges they have evolved to address. The current experimental project is motivated by a recent theoretical work by the PI, which applies advanced tools of statistical physics to such biological problems. In the proposed experiments, a chemotaxis assay of a new type will be specially built to test those key predictions of the new theory. This project has the potential to change a widely accepted part of the paradigm of E.coli chemotaxis and possibly change the perspective on directed motion of other cells and organisms. The study synergistically combines theoretical analysis, innovative microfluidic technology, microbiology and molecular biology techniques, quantitative experiments with cells, and advanced microscopy and data analysis. The PI and Co-PI have complementary areas of expertise and have known each other for more than a decade from their previous work on mixing in chaotic and turbulent flows. Graduate students will be trained in cross-disciplinary environment and benefit from the synergism of the two groups involved in the proposed project with their complementary areas of expertise. The PIs will also continue to be involved in education, instruction and training that closely interface with the proposed work. <br/><br/>The project is an experimental study of the role of adaptation in chemotaxis of Escherichia coli in different types of gradients of chemo-attractants and of adaptation in aerotaxis and pH-taxis of E. coli. A remarkable feature of E. coli chemotaxis is the perfect adaptation to changes in the concentration of aspartate, a commonly used attractant. The response of E. coli to a short-term change in aspartate concentration has asymmetric positive and negative lobes, with the integral equal to zero. The proposed experimental study is driven by a recent theoretical analysis by the PI, showing that the main advantage of the perfect adaptation is optimal navigation through environments with time-varying, complex spatial distributions of nutrients. Environments of this type are likely to be present in liquid E. coli cultures at the entry to the stationary phase, where E. coli motility is at its maximum. This analysis represents an alternative to a common narrative that the main function of the perfect adaptation is the retention of sensitivity to shallow gradients over a broad range of background concentrations. The theoretical predictions will be tested with a two-pronged experimental approach. First, chemotaxis of freely swimming wild-type and mutated E. coli will be studied in static linear profiles of attractants, for which the perfect adaptation is predicted to be non-optimal. Therefore, perfectly adapted E. coli are expected to have lower chemotactic efficiency than some of imperfectly adapted E. coli. Second, E. coli chemotaxis will be studied in a custom-built microfluidic device, which creates time-varying spatially non-uniform gradients of attractants. Based on the theory, the perfectly adapted E. coli are expected to outperform all competitors, securing highest average concentrations of the attractant along their swimming trajectories. The experiments will be facilitated by a technique recently developed by the PI that extracts temporal responses from trajectories of freely swimming cells. The proposed study will also apply this technique to the analysis directed motion of E. coli in well-defined gradients of oxygen and pH in a microfluidic device recently built by the Co-PI."

The main physics program supported by this grant is to study of the quark structure of nucleons. More information is needed about the details of this quark structure. One aspect that is particularly interesting is the existence of anti-quarks in the proton, which is a consequence of quantum mechanics. An experiment called Seaquest uses high-energy protons from the Fermilab accelerator to study these anti-quark distributions in the nucleon and in nuclei. This experiment will achieve unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the anti-quark distributions. Beyond the field of particle physics, these distributions are useful in cosmology as they seek to understand matter at the galactic scale.  Beyond the scientific goals, the proposed detector commissioning, data acquisition and analysis activities will continue to offer education and research experience to undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/>This three-year research program will study the ratio of anti-down quarks to anti-up quarks in the nucleon and in nuclei using the Drell-Yan reaction at Fermilab. At high momentum fraction these poorly known anti-quark distributions may provide a partonic understanding of the well known ""pion cloud"" model of classical nuclear physics. The reaction in nuclear targets will also be used to study quark energy loss. The Colorado group has nearly completed a new tracking detector for the Seaquest spectrometer, providing a larger acceptance and higher rate capabilities, and plans to complete, install, and commission this detector."

One of the key notions in this new era is the quantum-mechanical property of entanglement, which characterizes how quantum particles are correlated with each other purely as a result of their quantum-mechanical nature. The influence of inter-particle interactions on entanglement is a challenging question, as interactions (in particular strong ones) drive phase transitions and are responsible for intriguing properties of matter. Information-related quantities, such as the entanglement entropy, play an essential role in quantum phase transitions and are central to seemingly disparate areas, such as quantum computation and black holes. The PI will leverage computational progress in atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics to pursue a deeper understanding of strongly interacting superfluid systems at the interface between those areas, where entanglement properties remain largely unexplored. This project will provide precise predictions of entanglement and its correlation with thermodynamic observables across a wide variety of systems. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged at multiple levels, with emphasis on an ongoing curriculum and track-developing collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.<br/><br/>This project aims for a precise characterization of a wide range of strongly coupled, non-relativistic, few- and many-fermion systems of relevance to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. The systems considered here will include multiple spatial dimensions, free space, harmonic traps, and weakly to strongly interacting regimes. Thermodynamic properties (static, dynamic, structural, and pairing correlations) and their connection to entanglement (entanglement entropies, mutual information) will be determined using non-perturbative approaches, including numerical lattice field theory methods as well as semi-analytic expansions (e.g. the virial and operator-product expansions). To this end, advanced computational methods and algorithms will be implemented and new approaches will be explored to calculate entanglement entropies. The methods (codes, scripts, technical notes) and the data (from auxiliary field configurations to the physical results) will be made available online."

Fundamental research is required to accelerate the development of new technologies for neuroscience and near engineering in order to address important societal needs with respect to the development of new ways to treat, prevent, and cure brain disorders. In this larger context, this collaborative project will extend methods of statistical physics to bridge from microscopic neurobiological observations of neurons, axons and dendrites to the mesoscopic images of brain organization seen in diffusion MRI images of the entire primate brain. A particular focus will be to address the question of how the processes of the brain might exploit this special architecture for the representation and processing of information, and in particular, how this regular structure might support time-coding and synchronization of information across the brain.<br/><br/>Joining a physics laboratory, a neurobiology laboratory, and an MRI laboratory, this team will investigates the hypothesis that brain connectivity is geometrically organized, with connectivity generally aligned with the axes of a curved, but essentially orthogonal coordinate system or 3D grid. The idea that the brain of all species with bilateral symmetry is based on an orthogonal plan is not new. It has been recognized in embryology and evolutionary biology for nearly 100 years and more recently has been validated in detail in studies of gene expression. Preliminary studies have suggested that this orthogonal motif pervades the structure of the brain, and particularly connectivity, from macroscopic down to a cellular level. In this interdisciplinary project, the investigators will quantify this phenomenon by looking at structural data from both diffusion MRI and advanced methods of 3D light microscopy and then apply the ideas and tools of condensed matter physics to characterize the structure and circuits of the brain as organized matter. As a first example, having observed 3 orthogonal fiber directions at each point in the brain that vary smoothly, it is natural to model this as a liquid crystal with a deformation energy and temperature. Then, one can investigate its scaling in the brain, and transitions such as those from white matter to gray matter. Functionally, we hypothesize that this rectilinear grid, may provide a new mechanism for neural activity to be temporally correlated, owing to its extremely high degeneracy of path lengths and transmission delays, which we will model as a directed percolation."

Strikingly diverse topics in physics, ranging from the study of magnets to the dynamics of the strong force to the mysteries of quantum gravity, have been unified within a single framework: Conformal Field Theory (CFT).  Roughly speaking, CFTs are quantum theories that combine special relativity with scale invariance, or invariance under the uniform stretching of space and time.  The research funded by this award will use foundational principles to study CFTs and apply these discoveries to phenomenology, quantum gravity, and black hole physics.<br/><br/>By applying the bottom-up methodology of effective field theory (EFT)and the CFT Bootstrap to the study of holography, the PI will uncover the robust features of quantum gravity.  He will expand on nascent programs characterizing general holographic dualities in terms of bulk EFT, and universal long-distance Anti de-Sitter (AdS) physics in terms of the large spin CFT bootstrap.  He will adapt his expertise from the study of scattering amplitudes and the bootstrap to make previously intractable computations simple.  The relationship between CFT and canonical gravity in AdS will be investigated to develop a deeper understanding of the emergence of bulk dynamics.   New discoveries will also have significant payoffs for phenomenological models and for the broader understanding of Quantum Field Theory (QFT).  The study of EFT in AdS has motivated new techniques for the solution of approximately conformal QFTs, and these methods will be deployed in order to study theories of relevance to phenomenology and condensed matter.<br/><br/>Specific goals are to understand the space of well-defined local quantum theories of gravity in AdS, to perform new non-perturbative studies of physically interesting CFTs, to study the robustness of black hole thermality and the CFT data that encode non-thermal corrections, and to build concrete connections between the holographic CFT and older descriptions of canonical quantum gravity, such as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, in order to understand the interior of black holes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  With help and input from students, the PI will develop his materials on the ""AdS/CFT from the Bottom-Up"" into<br/>extensive published course notes.  The PI will also develop footage leftover from the documentary ""Particle Fever"" into short films for the education of high school students and the general public.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces and the development of concepts that now constitute what we call physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  This award supports research that addresses those questions that dominate BSM physics.   The research will be carried out at the LHC, which is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.<br/><br/>LHCb is the first experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at a hadron collider. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, are manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, which would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. In direct searches for new particles, the accelerator's energy must be high enough to allow the particle to be produced. In indirect searches effects of new particles can be seen even if they have a much higher mass than can be seen directly, because the effects are quantum in nature, and appear in Feynman diagrams where the particles are"" virtual"", so they are emitted and absorbed over short times.<br/><br/>LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010.  This award will allow the study of rare decays of heavy quark systems. These decays provide a unique window into physics at an energy scale well beyond that accessible by explicit production of new particles at colliders. This is increasingly important as the limits for new physics by CMS and ATLAS increase, the only window may turn out to be in the studies of rare decays. This work will concentrate mostly on charm quark physics, the expertise of the group. These charm channels can show BSM physics in CP violation and other parity violating asymmetries.  Any discovery of BSM physics would be a huge step forward in our understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe. In addition, this award will facilitate a small part of the ongoing LHCb detector upgrade that will improve the overall ability of the detector to fully exploit the LHC data."

The objectives include: (1) to compare event generator predictions with experimental data, focusing on comparisons with measurements that the Virginia Tech group and collaborators will perform in Liquid Argon using the MicroBooNE detector; (2) to determine the impact of nuclear models, correlations and neutrino interaction uncertainties on the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector and the experimental determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters; (3) to include state-of-the-art nuclear models in the neutrino interaction simulation and (4) to determine the level of detail needed in these models to achieve the required sensitivity to observe CP violation.   The proposed research is potentially transformative, by altering and refining the scope of the GENIE neutrino event generator to predict events more precisely and interface it with the GLoBES simulator to understand the effect of neutrino interactions on the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters for past and future neutrino experiments worldwide.<br/><br/>In parallel with the research, the program includes important educational components, directed at high school and more advanced levels.

For example, stellar burning is responsible for the production of elements up to iron, and neutron capture processes create most of the heavy elements. However, the origin of heavy, proton-rich nuclei above iron is one of the greatest puzzles of stellar nucleosynthesis. The most likely scenario for creating these isotopes is the p-process: a complex network of photodisintegration reactions and their inverse (proton-, alpha- and neutron-capture) that occur during the explosion of a supernova. A vast network of 20,000 nuclear reactions for the p-process relies on models to provide input of nuclear properties and reaction rates for all the nuclei involved in the network. The goal of this project is to identify the reactions that are key for the p-process and to measure them directly, so as to minimize the uncertainty for those rates and provide constraints for the model predictions. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to understanding of the stellar p-process by measuring cross sections for proton and alpha capture reactions of relevance for Pd-102, Cd-108, Cd-110, Te-120 and Te-122. Those reactions have not been measured before, and have been identified as key for the p-process by two independent sensitivity studies. Studies have shown that the variations of those rates within the current model uncertainties have a significant impact on the production of the p-nuclei. The project will utilize a newly purchased detector (HECTOR) to employ the &#947;-summing technique. The impact of the measured reaction rates on the final abundances of the p-nuclei will be verified using network calculations whose results will be compared with the solar abundances. Additionally, the measured cross sections will be compared with model predictions and will be used to identify the model inputs that best reproduce the data."

To discover the nature of this so-called dark matter is a major open question in physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Dark matter has been detected only by means of the gravity it generates, and has properties that are completely different from those of any other known physical matter. Establishing the nature of dark matter may have implications as important as the Copernican revolution that shifted the Earth's place in the Universe away from its center, this time by relegating the material substance humans are made of to a minority component. Research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental aspects: discovering the nature and composition of our physical universe. In their research, Professors Gondolo and Sandick aim to further our understanding of dark matter and our ability to sort viable dark-matter models on the basis of their observable effects. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts, including educating and exciting the local non-academic community about science and training early-career scientists. The project will also support a long-standing and successful outreach program at a local science museum and in local schools that reaches thousands of young students with the goal of attracting them to science in a fun, energetic, and engaging way.   At the same time, this project supports efforts to recruit and retain talented women and minorities in the physical sciences through a suite of outreach and professional-development programs at the University of Utah, in the broader community, and at the national level.<br/><br/>Technically, Professors Gondolo and Sandick will conduct individual research programs with elements in common.  They will (a) explore theoretical explanations for the dark matter in the Universe and for theories of new particle physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics; (b) better understand the assumptions and the uncertainties inherent in the relevant calculations; and (c) determine and suggest robust strategies for the identification of dark matter and, potentially, other new physics. These objectives will be achieved through phenomenological studies of collider and dark-matter signatures in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and in simplified models, the development of the DarkSUSY software to address generic weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) models, and the pursuit of a minimal number of assumptions in the particle physics and astrophysics of dark matter through astrophysics-independent methods and general interaction lagrangians."

The focus of WiPPL is the science of plasmas, the fourth state of matter. Comprised of two large plasma research devices, the Big Red Ball (BRB) and the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST), the vision for WiPPL is to experimentally advance the fundamental understanding of terrestrial, space, and astrophysical plasmas, thereby advancing a major physics frontier. The addition of the new power supply provides for substantially more flexible and sophisticated plasma experiments at WiPPL. Hence, the facility will be able to push even farther into the frontiers of plasma science, attracting users from the U.S. and abroad. A power supply of this design could also serve as an invaluable tool in other laboratories, given the supply's flexibility and modularity. The strong local enhancement of the research infrastructure afforded by this power supply is matched by the equally important enhancement to education of the UW-Madison's diverse community of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows at WiPPL. <br/><br/>This new power supply is digitally programmable and feedback controlled, and it has a wide array of both present and future applications for WiPPL, providing electrical current of varying magnitude and virtually arbitrary waveform. This current will drive electromagnets that help confine and control the BRB and MST plasmas, but the current will also be used to create, sustain, heat, and manipulate the plasmas themselves. Some experiments will be accomplished much more readily and quickly with this supply, but it also enables other experiments that would range from difficult to impossible without it. The research on WiPPL includes the plasma generation of magnetic fields, plasma-driven tearing of magnetic field lines, and charged particle acceleration. These processes and others occur in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial plasmas, and much of the research at WiPPL is inspired by astrophysical and space plasma phenomena. Hence, this research will help bridge the gap between plasma science in the laboratory and astrophysical and space plasma science. This new power supply will substantially enhance and broaden the basic plasma science research that can be carried out at WiPPL.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For nearly a century, physicists have used quantum mechanics to understand many properties of the physical world, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the nuclear forces that govern sub-atomic particles. Predictions from the theory have matched experimental observations to impeccable accuracy. Conceptually, however, the theory includes some strikingly strange features. Among the most curious is known as ""quantum entanglement."" According to quantum mechanics, particles that have been prepared in a special way can retain a connection, even after they have moved arbitrarily far apart from each other--a property which Albert Einstein dubbed ""spooky actions at a distance."" Nowadays entanglement is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies, including quantum encryption and quantum computing. Yet every experimental test of quantum entanglement to date has been subject to various loopholes: alternative explanations, different than quantum theory, that might account for the long-distance correlations in the particles' behavior. In this project, the principal investigators aim to address the most stubborn, and least studied, of these loopholes, known as the ""setting independence loophole."" To shield against any unintended coordination between the particles and the measurement apparatus--coordination that could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics--the selection of which properties of the particles to be measured will be determined by real-time observation of some of the oldest light in our universe: light that was emitted from astronomical objects so far away from Earth and from each other that neither object would have been able to receive any signals from each other prior to the moment they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. The new series of experiments will thus test entanglement on an entirely new scale. If, as expected, the results match the predictions from quantum mechanics, then any alternatives will be ruled out or severely constrained, and new technologies such as quantum encryption will be placed on the strongest possible footing. If, on the other hand, the experiment finds novel departures from predictions, that could point toward profoundly new physics.  This project also has an informal education component that will take place through exhibits and programs at the MIT Museum; these will connect the public to the experiment as it evolves in real time, and will be evaluated and widely disseminated. <br/><br/>Experimental tests of Bell's inequality have been subject to several loopholes which hold out the possibility, however slim, that individual particles could possess simultaneously sharp values for noncommuting variables. Such behavior would be at odds with quantum mechanics, and would subject quantum-encryption protocols to new vulnerabilities. The most subtle loophole is known as ""setting independence."" In any test of entanglement, one must select detector settings on each side of the experimental apparatus, choosing to measure, for example, a particle's spin along the x-axis, the y-axis, or some intermediate angle. The usual assumption is that no third party, acting in the shared causal past of the entangled particles and the measurement apparatus, has affected the joint probability distribution for detector settings. Yet even a tiny coordination among detector settings and the entangled particles could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics. In this series of experiments, the principal investigators aim to address the setting-independence loophole using real-time observations of distant astronomical sources, such as quasars--sources that were causally isolated from each other and from the worldline of the Earth at the time they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. Any non-quantum-mechanical coordination among elements of the experiment would thereby be pushed back billions of years, in some scenarios back to the big bang itself, an improvement of 20 orders of magnitude over current constraints."

Approximately 30,000 accelerators are currently used to diagnose and treat diseases, to improve manufacturing processes (ion implantation for electronics; hardening surfaces and materials; welding and cutting; and treating waste and medical material), and to address energy, environment and security issues (biofuel production and oil and gas exploration; cleaning flue gases of thermal power plants; and inspecting cargo and improving the monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance).

(i) A study will be undertaken to understand the science that underlies dramatic improvements in the quality factor of superconducting, radio-frequency cavities via nitrogen doping.  This could reduce capital and operational costs. (ii) A proof-of-principle experiment for accelerators with highly non-linear components will be performed.  This could lead to a significant suppression of the instabilities that have plagued intense beams. (iii) New mechanisms will be developed to produce intense X-rays, an indispensable tool for studying the atomic and molecular arrangement of materials."

The project will promote the progress of science by advancing fundamental understanding of excitons at trapping defects and realizing a single-photon source that operates at room temperature and can be driven electrically.  In addition to advancing an emerging frontier across chemistry, physics, quantum information science, and engineering, the work in this project is anticipated to also have a positive societal impact. First, the work will contribute to the development of next-generation computing and information technology by building interfaces between electronics and single-photon optics. Second, the project will provide exciting opportunities to engage students and reach a broader community. Particularly, this collaborative project will provide unique training opportunities for the next-generation workforce in quantum information science and technology through close collaborations with IBM and LANL, which are expected to enrich graduate training in this quickly evolving interdisciplinary field. <br/><br/>This RAISE project will focus on probing and controlling the radiative recombination of electrons and holes at organic color-centers with the goal of achieving electrically driven single-photon sources that work at room temperature. Because the color centers are directly created in a carbon nanotube semiconductor host that can be controlled with established semiconductor technologies, electrons and holes can be electrically injected and directed to the color center where they recombine to produce single photons. This hypothesis is strongly supported by preliminary results and will be fully verified by experimental and theoretical efforts. The work is potentially groundbreaking and technologically transformative. First, organic color-centers provide a chemical pathway to synthesize high-quality single-photon sources. Unlike other color centers, which typically occur as native defects, organic color-centers can be synthetically created with molecular precision, thus opening vast opportunities for chemical innovation. Second, organic color-centers act as a two-level system in a semiconductor, effectively providing a ""desktop atomic physics"" laboratory for studying quasi-particles such as excitons and trions in trapping defects. Third, single-photon sources that can be driven electrically and work at room temperature will be an enabling element for quantum information science. Single photons are ideal quantum bits because they exhibit nearly infinite coherence time and can propagate over long distances. However, currently available solid-state single-photon sources suffer from limited scalability. Organic color-centers can be synthetically created in a semiconductor with molecular precision, opening up the possibility to address this significant challenge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting will bring together 75 researchers and 75 graduate students, drawn from both biological and physical science, to discuss this topic, broadly construed. The meeting will take place in the Bulgarian town of Varna and will last six days. The two initial days will consist of tutorial lectures for the trainees as well as informal gatherings by the senior participants. Afterward there will be four full days of scientific lectures on the state-of-the-art of both experimental techniques and modeling approaches to this extremely exciting topical area. This award will fund the participation of the US scientists in this meeting as well as some overall logistical costs. In recent years, there has been growing excitement about using ideas from physical science to make sense of genome structure in eukaryotic cells.  This workshop will be devoted to the basic mechanisms underlying chromatin dynamics and to the methods available to investigate these mechanisms. At the same time, it is clear that basic understanding will go a long way toward being able to understand, and perhaps affect for the better, the role of chromatin in diseases such as cancer and in the aging process.<br/><br/>There are a variety of broader impacts that will arise from this meeting. For the training aspects, the organizers will recruit students either directly from the labs of senior participants or through the Physics of Living Systems graduate network.  Next. Bulgaria has a long scientific tradition, and a visit to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences reveals that one of the main focus areas is chromatin structure. The Academy members welcome the opportunity to integrate their research in this area (and their students being trained as part of the research) with the overall international community  and have allocated funds for the Bulgarian participants in the meeting.  Thus an additional broader impact will be to broaden the international community in a manner which would clearly be helpful to everyone.<br/><br/>The structure of the DNA molecule and its associated proteins (commonly referred to as chromatin) is of great interest, both because of the intrinsic problems of how it can be fit into the nucleus and go through various stages as the cell cycle progresses and because it has a major effect on the accessibility of genes and hence couples to cellular differentiation. The excitement has arisen due both to the increasing recognition of the importance of chromatin dynamics for cell function and to the invention of a variety of extremely powerful experimental techniques for determining chromatin properties. This meeting will bring together many of the individuals from around the world leading this field and should have the ability to accelerate focused research in this area for the coming years. The combination of cutting-edge science will enable the organizers to attract a large number of leaders in the field and make this meeting a seminal event.

Such new capability will enable access to new regimes of high-energy density science, including studies of materials under extreme conditions that exist in stars and planetary interiors.  The constraints on laser intensity arise because conventional optical components are damaged or destroyed when exposed to high intensity lasers. This research will investigate how these limits can be overcome when  conventional optical elements are replaced with plasma structures.  At a fundamental level, the project investigates the control of nonlinear systems with large numbers of interacting components as a theme that runs through many branches of physics and is one of the greatest challenges in modern science.  This research is also expected to have a significant impact on optical science by allowing for new regimes of optical manipulation of intense laser pulses and may lead to new ideas for inertial fusion and plasma-based ion accelerators. <br/><br/>Unlike conventional structures, where an electric field triggers changes in structure behavior, plasma can be sculpted using light manipulation techniques to create novel, robust, optical elements on nanosecond timescales. Within this broad area of inquiry, the research supported by this award will focus on generating Bragg reflectors by manipulating ion acoustic waves. Theoretical research will examine structure dynamics and their utility for intense pulse compression. Such structures may be stationary or moving.

Continued advances in laser science have enabled the development of more energetic and more powerful lasers that can provide unprecedented access to ultrafast time scales and to temperatures and pressures once reserved for the Sun. The utility of these lasers is limited by conventional laser optics, typically made of glass, which break down under high incident laser energy flux. In order to support high-energy lasers using conventional materials, special large-aperture optics are required to reduce the energy per unit area.  The spatial limitations, complexity, and costs associated with such optics are a roadblock to the development and deployment of high-energy and high-peak-power lasers.  Plasma-based optical devices offer an alternative to the conventional optics because they are not limited by material breakdown.  The laser and x-ray technology enabled by plasma-based optical devices would be used in a wide range of applied research from materials science to biology to medicine.<br/><br/>Development of plasma-based photonic devices from proof-of-principle concepts to an enabling technology for next-generation lasers requires improved understanding of their performance capabilities and limitations. The highest-level objective of this research project is to understand the plasma physics of photonic devices by demonstrating and fully characterizing ellipsoidal plasma mirrors (EPMs) for implementation in kilojoule (kJ)-class laser systems to produce high-quality laser pulses with modified temporal durations, increased laser contrast, and controllable focusing geometry. This work will include a series of experiments with detailed measurements of both the EPM performance and its effect on the laser properties. The advantage of the EPM technology is that it can be employed in existing lasers systems to increase their performance without having to modify the laser infrastructure. EPMs are an excellent option to control the focusing of ultrashort-pulse (< 100 fs), kJ-class lasers and could enable the high intensities necessary to explore emerging high-field scientific areas such as quantum electrodynamics and attosecond science.  This award to support an undergraduate student is made under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering and is complementary to a DOE award made under the joint program."

Understanding of the fundamental interaction<br/>between thermionic emission and microplasmas will be advanced by this research in order to pave<br/>the way for microplasma-TEC devices. First principles theory and simulations will be used to reveal<br/>the inter-dependence between a microplasma and thermionic emission, and experiments will be<br/>conducted to confirm the enhancement of thermionic emission by a microplasma necessary to realize<br/>improved energy conversion efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes, including diamond and carbon<br/>nanotubes, will be synthesized using a microplasma jet processing technique and used as electrodes<br/>in microplasma-TEC experiments. In addition to the efficacy of microplasma-TEC being established<br/>by this research, fundamental studies will also advance the basic understanding of plasma/electrode<br/>coupling, where there are persistent questions that affect a wide variety of technologies from highintensity<br/>discharge lamps to arc-based materials deposition.<br/><br/>Direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion can be used to convert solar, nuclear, and waste heat<br/>to electricity, and energy conversion technologies will play an important role in creating a more<br/>energy efficient and independent nation.

The task of engineering and controlling quantum systems to perform interesting information-processing tasks is one of the grand challenges for 21st Century science and technology. If successful, it will have far ranging implications for many technologies, including computation, communications, and environmental sensing. The Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) is a research center headquartered at the University of New Mexico, with an experimental node at the University of Arizona. Research at CQuIC focuses on the development of tools for the control of quantum systems and the application of those tools to information-processing tasks. Under this five-year award, CQuIC becomes a Focused Research Hub in Theoretical Physics (FRHTP). The activities of the FRHTP are centered on a stable of three postdoctoral research fellows who will, first, work with CQuIC's senior scientists and research students on projects generated by the FRHTP's Project Directors and, second, bring new expertise to CQuIC and introduce new research projects into the portfolio of quantum-control projects.  The chief outreach activity under the FRHTP is CQuIC's sponsorship and organization of the Annual Workshop of the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology Network. Held every February, the Workshop is attended by 150-225 scientists, with an emphasis on participation by undergraduate, graduate-student, and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>QIS is a large, diverse field that draws from a variety of disciplines in the sciences and engineering.  To do effective research in this field requires knowledge and expertise from many different backgrounds and attention to learning new theoretical concepts and experimental techniques as they are developed within or brought into the field.  CQuIC leaders categorize research projects in this diverse field in two ways.  The first focuses on the type of quantum system to be controlled. This encompasses the control and measurement of complex quantum systems, where the complexity arises because systems have many interacting parts (many-body systems), have Hilbert spaces of moderate to large dimension (qudits), or have complex dynamics by virtue of contact with environments or ancillas (open quantum systems).   The second categorizes the work according to objective, such as the development of tools for the control and measurement of complex quantum systems or on their application to specific computational, communication, or metrological control tasks.  Within this general framework, CQuIC pursues several research directions: foundational investigations in quantum information, control, and measurement; control of qudit atomic and optical systems; quantum control and squeezing of collective atomic spins; and analog quantum computation and simulation. Through close collaboration with experimental partners both within CQuIC, and within the larger SQuInT network, CQuIC advances both fundamental and practical aspects of quantum information science."

A revolutionary approach to computing is under development using quantum information processing.   However, there is still a gap between the testbeds for quantum information processing that exist today, and the more perfect hardware needed for an ideal quantum computer.  This project seeks to fill this gap by finding ways to use variable amounts of quantum behavior to incrementally improve computing systems.  The project will examine how to use quantum effects in order to provide benefits in terms of speed, energy, and hardware efficiency for applications in signal processing and machine learning.  The project will produce open source software for modeling quantum networks and will train graduate students to develop quantum information processing systems.<br/><br/>This effort builds on work designing circuits for autonomous continuous-time quantum error correction and ultra-low power information processing systems in photonic architectures.  The theoretical component of the project will provide tools to study quantum feedback in various computer architectures operating with open quantum systems.

The program has two goals: 1) to better understand matter in extreme conditions, and 2) to provide students with research experiences that stimulate an interest in science and technology, exposes them to techniques used in experimental high energy physics, allows the development of global relationships, and prepares them for careers in science and technology.  The project on which the students will work is focused on understanding the behavior of extremely dense matter, similar to that existing a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.  This is achieved by colliding atomic nuclei at very high energies and studying the remnants of these collisions using highly sophisticated detectors.  The students involved in this project will analyze the resulting sub-atomic particles generated by these collisions, and will contribute to the design of the sophisticated detectors that detect the particles emanating from these collisions.  Collaboration with a large international laboratory such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN allows students to work with world-class scientists and state of the art technology, thus, preparing them for STEM careers.   Additionally, a program such as this has the potential of creating a cadre of students who become ambassadors for STEM; students who demonstrate to their peers the benefits of pursuing careers in science, engineering, math and technology. Students who participate in this program may serve as mentors and role models for students of high school age and younger, thereby contributing to the creation of a pipeline of students actively preparing for careers in STEM.  <br/><br/>The focus of ALICE at CERN is to understand the behavior of matter at very high density, similar to the matter that existed a fraction a second after the Big Bang. This state of matter, consisting of a very hot and dense medium of quarks and gluons, is often referred to as a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By colliding nuclei at very high energies it is possible to create a QGP in a controlled environment that facilitates the study of its properties. Chicago State University (CSU) students will perform physics analysis of events triggered by jets detected in ALICE's Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EmCal) sub-detector. The students will investigate the flavor characteristics, specifically strangeness, of jets resulting from high-energy proton-proton, proton-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, as well as investigating the use of jets as probes in the study of QGP formation.  In addition, CSU students will participate in a research and development program devoted to the upgrade of the ALICE trigger detector known as the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT), thereby, participating in the hardware development of an important component within the ALICE experiment.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering."

These revolutionary achievements were enabled by sub-attometer position measurement technologies made possible over multi-kilometer baselines through the Advanced LIGO detector.  This new initiative, the  ""A+ upgrade"", can offer five times the gravitational wave event detection rate over the existing Advanced LIGO design. The enhanced capabilities afforded by A+ will be able to, among other science goals, illuminate the origins and evolution of stellar-mass black holes, allow precision tests of extreme gravity, enable detailed study of the equation of state of neutron stars, and permit new tests of cosmology, including fully independent constraints on the Hubble constant.  The A+ upgrade will also foster expanding community participation and enhance opportunities for education and public understanding of science. Both aspects of LIGO technology targeted by A+ are expected to be of keen interest to diverse communities, including quantum optics, quantum information theory, materials science, optical technology, precision metrology and physical standards.<br/><br/>The A+ upgrade addresses two technical limitations that have constrained the Advanced LIGO design target sensitivity: quantum mechanical uncertainty and classical Brownian noise in mirror coatings. The improved A+ instruments should reach observational readiness as soon as mid-2024, enabling LIGO to continue its leadership of the worldwide effort to open and exploit this new mode of observation. The A+ plan builds on the expertise and synergy of the joint international team that successfully delivered Advanced LIGO.  Approximately 35% of A+ hardware will be contributed by UK and Australian LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) groups, along with significant commitments of effort by UK and Australian personnel.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The William and Mary Group is searching for evidence of CP Violation (related to the imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe) with the NOvA experiment and is studying how neutrinos interact in normal matter with the MINERvA experiment.   The group is also engaged in R&D for DUNE, the next generation, long baseline neutrino experiment with endpoints at Fermilab in Illinois which provides the neutrino beam and the Sanford Underground Laboratory in South Dakota which is home for the detectors.   Presently under test are large detector prototypes called ""ProtoDUNEs"", which are massive liquid-Argon based detectors called Time Projection Chambers.  The testing is underway at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, and will guide the development of the massive detectors that will be built for DUNE in the next decade.<br/><br/>The William and Mary group is committed to engaging undergraduates in research as a vital component of their undergraduate education.   Beyond promoting science education at the College, the group operates a successful Emerging Scholars  program at a local elementary school. This ten-week, after-school program exposes students who are from communities historically underrepresented in the sciences to practicing physicists and exciting science activities. The program was developed in consultation with the Coordinator for Gifted and Talented Students of the Williamsburg- James City County schools and has grown and been strengthened based on feedback from follow-up discussions with the students and notes from in-session observations by specialists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology.

The local community will be broadly engaged in Chicago by integrating high school URM students of the Space Explorers Program and of the STEM Science Inquiry and Research program in a stimulating research environment, by enhancing the RISE program for URM middle-school students and by communicating science to older adults via the Life-long Learning program.<br/><br/>DAMIC at SNOLAB will stride to the forefront in the search for low-mass (<5 times the proton mass) WIMPs by the end of 2018.

Quantum defects in crystals have been shown to exhibit some of the characteristics needed to realize a scalable quantum network; however finding a system that simultaneously exhibits all of the requisite optical and quantum properties remains challenging. Based on promising preliminary results, single donor defects in zinc oxide (ZnO) may satisfy these criteria. This project is to demonstrate single ZnO donor creation and detection with complete control and characterization of the donor electron and nucleus. The goal is to determine the outlook of this system for scalable quantum information applications. In addition, the study of single donor impurities in ZnO may lead to new techniques for studying dopants in semiconductors and will train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in quantum optics and nanotechnology, preparing them for careers in national laboratories, industry, and academia.<br/><br/>Defect-based quantum information processing is attractive due to the potential for device integration, the possibility of spin-photon transfer, and the long quantum coherence time in high-purity crystals. For defect systems with optical radiation, measurement-based protocols can be utilized to create quantum networks between non-interacting, remotely separated qubits. This project will investigate a defect system with favorable optical properties, i.e. the donor system in ZnO, which has homogeneous optical transitions and near-unity radiative efficiency in the zero phonon line. Prior studies in an ensemble of donors showed the potential for long coherence times of the donor system if isotopically purified ZnO crystal is available. Here, different techniques will be utilized to isolate single donors: growth of single ZnO nanowires with small diameters, and nano-scale masking or focused ion beam etching combined with epitaxial ZnO layers of low donor density. The isolation of single donors will be confirmed by a photon autocorrelation measurement. Optical pumping and microwave pulses for high-fidelity coherent control will be used to study the optical and spin (electron and nuclear) coherence properties of single ZnO donors, testing the suitability of this system as a qubit candidate.  Due to the effective mass nature of the donor, it may be possible to generalize the quantum properties found in ZnO to the entire class of donors in direct band gap semiconductors, furthering the impact of this research.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program in the Physics Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in the Division of Materials Science in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to take advantage of quantum computation for simulating matter, new tools and methods must be developed to map model systems of fermions (e.g. electrons and certain nuclei) onto quantum computers. This project will develop models that incorporate topological ideas that aid qubit-based quantum computers to simulate the fermion systems found throughout chemistry, physics, and materials science. The nature of topologically inspired fermion-to-qubit mappings opens new possibilities for simulating electronic structure on the qubits of a quantum computer. This allows local addressing of information that is stored non-locally which helps to simplify the algorithms for quantum simulation.  The goals of this project include designing and implementing new algorithms that can be tested on early quantum hardware and incorporated into open-source code collections. The outcomes of this project will serve the broader scientific community by introducing tools that will be incorporated into rapidly developing quantum technology on the path to outpacing traditional computers. This project also include efforts to increase the inclusion of underrepresented groups in science and technology by inviting female freshmen and sophomore interns in conjunction with the Women In Science Project. <br/><br/>As part of the long-term goal to understand how best to utilize a quantum computer, the Topological Fermionic Quantum Simulation project aims to flesh out topological quantum simulation algorithms. The central hypothesis of this work is that topological approaches can enhance the efficiency of quantum simulations. This hypothesis has been formulated based on this team's preliminary findings demonstrating benefits for fermionic encodings based on locality of the encoded spin operator. The proposed work has three major directions. The first delves into automation and implementation of the Bravyi-Kitaev Super-Fast model and explores its close connections to the toric code. The second area is to consider auxiliary fermion methods where additional modes are included to reduce the locality of the spin operators. Third, group theoretic approaches to black box simulation are ripe to explore and integrate with this growing area of quantum simulation. There are two cross-cutting themes that overlap with all branches of the project: local basis set design and benchmarking with numerical tools and with existing quantum hardware. The basis sets play a vital role in determining the efficiency and accuracy of any simulation while actual implementations provide metrics for success. Extension of quantum simulation algorithms based on topology has the potential for an immediate impact on the use of quantum computers. Additionally, this project opens questions about the nature of fermions, provides insights into the limitations of simulating them, and informs the requirements for the quantum simulation path to quantum supremacy.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics Experiment program in the Division of Physics and the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry (both Divisions are in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences) as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF EPSCoR program).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the quantum Grover algorithm can find a marked item in a completely unordered list -- the proverbial needle in a haystack -- provably faster than any classical algorithm.  Practical search problems, however, typically have more structure than existing quantum algorithms exploit.  It is an outstanding open question exactly where speed ups can be found, and where they will be unachievable. This research aims to address these questions by drawing inspiration from the physics of disordered systems, where there are many known structural mechanisms which produce slow, or 'glassy', dynamics.  The project further aims to elucidate the physical consequences of one of the most dramatic quantum mechanisms for slow dynamics: many-body localization (MBL). Although first postulated over 50 years ago, this mechanism has only recently come into sharp theoretical and experimental focus as large-scale isolated quantum systems such as ultracold atoms, ion traps, and superconducting qubit arrays have been built. It is particularly intriguing as localization prevents the emergence of classical behavior. From an quantum algorithmic point of view, the role localization plays is thus unclear. On the one hand, it leads to very slow dynamics and presumably very slow search behavior. On the other hand, one can only hope to achieve quantum mechanical speed ups in systems which do not behave classically! This suggests that one needs localization to obtain such speed ups. Whether this is true and, if so, how to exploit it are crucial open questions.<br/><br/>Thus, this CAREER award supports theoretical research and educational activities on two interrelated foci: 1) the computational complexity, typical structure and algorithmic approaches to quantum optimization problems; and, 2) the phenomenology of many-body localization (MBL) and its role in quantum computation and glassy dynamics. Theoretical methods include the cavity method, random matrix theory, large-N and many-body perturbation theory while numerical approaches include quantum Monte Carlo, the density matrix renormalization group and large scale diagonalization. Specifically, the PI proposes to investigate the phase diagram and transitions, geometrization and clustering of the configuration space in quantum satisfiability and related classical constraint satisfaction problems. The PI expects this study to aid the development of heuristic quantum algorithms for approximate optimization and landscape exploration. Many-body localization (MBL) constitutes a fundamental breakdown of quantum statistical mechanics in the presence of quenched disorder and protects quantum coherence out of equilibrium. The project addresses foundational questions about the theory of the delocalization transition and the influence of disorder versus quasiperiodic modulation, dimensionality and the range of interactions on localization. It also seeks to apply these ideas to understanding the behavior of quantum annealing applied to NP-hard optimization problems.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory (CMMT) Program in the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Algorithmic Foundations (AF) Program in the Computing and Communications Foundations Division in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An experimental setup limited by both radiation pressure and shot noise in a low noise cryogenic environment will be developed. To achieve this in a small scale prototype, micro-fabricated mechanical resonators (of order 100 nanograms) will be used as one mirror of a high finesse optical cavity inside a low vibration cryostat, cooled to below 10K. A series of experiments will then be performed to verify models of quantum noise, and to test methods for its reduction. Specifically, a homodyne detector will be used to perform a variational readout of the resonator's position, to exploit the ponderomotive squeezing, and to evade the radiation pressure noise at a single frequency. A filter cavity will then be introduced to evade the radiation pressure noise in a wide frequency band. Advanced LIGO and other second generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to be limited by quantum noise across the majority of their detection frequency band. At low frequencies, the test masses are driven by radiation pressure and at high frequencies, shot noise limits the phase precision of the measurement. Together, the radiation pressure and shot noise represent a significant limit on the sensitivities of future gravitational-wave detectors. Collaboration with other groups within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration will provide access to a source of squeezed vacuum states, which will be used to directly reduce the radiation pressure noise. Alternative topologies, such as the speedmeter and dual-carrier readout, will also be explored. By using a combination of optical trapping and cooling, the mechanical resonators will be placed into low noise states, with decoherence rates less than their oscillation frequency, allowing for the resonators to be placed in non-classical states, as a test of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>This research program will substantially enhance the on-campus research activities of the experimental gravitational physics program at Louisiana State University. Because of LSU's proximity to the LIGO Livingston Observatory, and the PI's other research activities within the LIGO project, there will be substantial personnel and intellectual overlap between LIGO commissioning, other on-site work, and R&D activities. Integration among these activities will strengthen the LIGO project and reduce risk, as well as advance the frontier of gravitational-wave science. Students and post-docs with experience in both small scale lab experiments and large scientific collaborations will be trained. The nature of this work naturally leads to collaboration between the GW community and the fields of quantum optics and quantum information. The thermal noise characterization experiments will have wide ranging applications to many systems limited by thermal noise. A summer research and education program aimed at undergraduate juniors will be developed, with the goal of encouraging and helping underrepresented groups in the region enter and succeed in graduate school within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. This program will contain both a research and an education component, and will work strongly with existing programs including the LIGO Science Education Center, Southern University Baton Rouge's Timbuktu Academy, and the outreach group in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to develop the educational program and to attract students."

During inflation, quantum fluctuations in the energy density of the Universe were imprinted on cosmological scales, seeding the structures that eventually became galaxies.  We do not know why inflation happened or why it ended.  Moreover, inflation left the Universe devoid of all matter and radiation, yet the measured abundances of light elements imply that the Universe was filled with extremely hot radiation one second after inflation ended.  Professor Erickcek aims to fill this gap in the cosmological record by studying the smallest gravitationally bound clumps of dark matter, which is an unknown source of mass that currently makes up about 25% of the energy density of the Universe.   In addition to improving our understanding of the early Universe and the properties of dark matter --- thus advancing the national interest by promoting the progress of science --- this project will also have significant broader impacts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will contribute to this investigation and will receive training both in physical cosmology and in widely applicable mathematical and computational techniques.  Professor Erickcek will also bring the excitement of this research to high-school students by working with educators at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center to develop an inquiry-based curriculum module that incorporates the evidence for dark matter into lessons on Newtonian mechanics, thereby exposing students to one of the great mysteries of cosmology.  This module will be made publicly available, and Professor Erickcek will lead professional-development workshops at North Carolina teaching conferences to train high-school teachers to use this module in their classrooms.  Finally, Professor Erickcek will share her research with the general public by hosting Morehead's Carolina Science Cafe and Teen Science Cafe.<br/><br/>More specifically, the smallest and earliest-forming dark matter halos provide a window into the gap between inflation and the hot Big Bang because their abundance is affected by the properties of the density fluctuations created during the final stages of inflation and the evolution of the Universe during its first second.  Professor Erickcek will extend her prior work on how gamma-ray observations constrain thermal dark-matter production during an early matter-dominated era to other thermal histories and dark-matter creation mechanisms.  This investigation will narrow the field of potential dark-matter candidates by restricting their production mechanisms and breaking the degeneracy between relic abundance and thermal history.  In particular, it will determine if gravitationally coupled moduli fields with masses around the TeV scale are compatible with neutralino dark matter, and may rule out super-heavy hidden-sector particles as dark-matter candidates.  This investigation will also determine how enhanced small-scale inhomogeneity generated during inflation affects the microhalo abundance and the dark-matter annihilation rate.  Professor Erickcek's group will then derive robust constraints on small-scale primordial fluctuations that will improve our understanding of inflation.  Both of these tasks will utilize small-box, high-redshift simulations of microhalo formation.  Finally, Professor Erickcek will explore how observations of the cosmic microwave background, 21cm tomography, and measurements of the temperature of the intergalactic medium may expose the existence of early-forming microhalos and allow us to close this gap in our understanding of the early Universe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract  students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.<br/><br/>There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process.

A well functioning virtual network could give students at local nodes the ability to take advantage of global educational and research opportunities in PoLS. PoLS is a diverse field, and is composed of researchers and students from varied backgrounds. No single institution can offer (1) the breadth and depth of research and (2) courses that both cover the relevant intellectual landscape and provide in-depth training for students. Such training is critical to create the next generation of researchers who can contribute quantitatively to biophysics, with the ability to move between biology, physics, mathematics, and engineering; PoLS students have important roles to play in this next generation. In addition, no single institution has the range of equipment needed to study PoLS on the enormous range of time and length scales encountered in biological systems. Finally, few single institutions can fruitfully integrate science and engineering to inspire biomedical, robotic and prosthetic devices that will result from basic PoLS research. The HF-SRN will create an environment for students in which they can work among various disciplines while maintaining the physics mindset (simplified systems, few parameter predictive models) and developing new physics. This network will train students (paraphrasing Philip Nelson in his 2008 Biological Physics textbook) ""who can switch fluidly between both kinds of brain: the `developmental/historical/complex' sciences and the 'universal/ahistorical/reductionist'."" As significant collaborative and educational flux develops within the HF-SRN, successful activities will be broadened to the other US nodes (ultimately with the expectation to engage PoLS SRN international partners). The evaluation plan will help guide aspects of the HF-SRN that could increase flux in other programs in the NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes initiative. More broadly, PoLS SRN students can be leaders in the next generation of researchers who blend biology and physics research seamlessly. Such students will create materials which will seed future K-12 as well as university PoLS curricula. Efforts will be made to extend the educational and research efforts developed within the HF-SRN (and entire SRN) to a broader community including local minority serving institutions. Advances in PoLS can lead to advances in applications such as genome editing, cancer dynamics, robotics and human-assist devices, among others.<br/><br/>During the last period of funding as part of the SRN, the Georgia Tech, Harvard and Maryland nodes have advanced their respective PoLS programs, developing cohesive local communities. The goal of this project is to further develop opportunities for students (and their ideas) to ""flow"" more easily within the SRN and thereby discover working principles of increased human network flux that can be transferred into the larger SRN. To do so, significant interactions (and evaluations of those interactions) will be developed among three existing SRN nodes (adding Emory as a subcontract to Georgia Tech), forming a ""High Flux SRN"" (HF-SRN). The HF-SRN will engage in activities such as 1) Collaborative Focused Research Projects, which span nodes and are ""built to succeed"" by leveraging student and faculty expertise in current projects; 2) Student-Led Dynamic Working Groups (e.g., in biomolecular, microbial, cellular and organismal physics) leveraging faculty research strengths and student interest to develop cross-node communities for these topics. 3) Student-Led Bootcamps: intense 2-3 day tutorials (e.g., microscopy, robophysics, image analysis) with cross-subgroup cutting themes, open to HF-SRN members and held at a particular node; 4) Student-Led Workshops: composed of talks, poster and discussion sessions, inviting the entire PoLS SRN; 5) Curriculum development via open-source course materials, integrating complementary expertise across nodes. All activities will be evaluated and assessed by a Council composed of the lead PIs at each node.

The award will continue NSCL's national and international leadership in<br/>these areas by supporting its operation as the nation's premier user facility dedicated to the<br/>production and study of rare (short-lived) isotopes. The award will also allow the NSCL to exploit<br/>the scientific opportunities newly available with the recently commissioned and world-unique<br/>ReA3 beamline accelerator that enables experiments at energies that have not been explored with<br/>rare isotopes and are relevant to supernovae and the structure of nuclei. These opportunities have<br/>strong overlap with the stated scientific goals of the 2015 NSAC Long Range Plan, and form a<br/>coherent trajectory towards the next generation accelerator, FRIB, which is being constructed on<br/>the NSCL site. Approximately 80% of those conducting research at the NSCL are from outside<br/>MSU and the support of NSCL will serve a broad scientific community. As the nation's largest<br/>university-based user facility for nuclear physics, the NSCL will continue to provide unique handson<br/>learning opportunities for educating the next generation of nuclear scientists, accelerator<br/>physicists, and engineers. Approximately 10% of all nuclear science PhDs awarded in the United<br/>States are based on research carried out at the NSCL, and approximately 100 undergraduate<br/>students are actively involved in research at the NSCL each year. The laboratory has extensive<br/>outreach activities, including facility tours for over 4000 people each year.

The<br/>isotope of choice for a specific experiment is selected by means of a fragment separator: a magnetic<br/>chicane that permits only a specific charge and mass through its pathway. The nuclei emerging<br/>from the fragment separator form a new beam for use in studying various nuclear reactions.

The NSCL can<br/>also bring the unstable isotopes to a complete stop using a dense gas; this in turn enables<br/>experiments such as mass measurements using trapping techniques also used in atomic and<br/>molecular physics. The ReA3 beamline accelerator reaccelerates stopped isotopes to low energies<br/>(well below in-flight levels) for experiments that are important for nuclear astrophysics, including<br/>the origin of stellar energy production as well as the dynamics of the birth and death of stars.

The ability to image ever deeper in the brain with optical methods is a key enabling technology in our ability to decipher neuronal anatomy and circuit function as well as neurovascular function. Optical tools, together with labels of specific brain structures, are the only means to probe the geometry and state variables of single cells, e.g., voltage and second messengers, and the dynamics of brain vasculature in a noninvasive or partially invasive manner in vivo. The current method of choice for in vivo imaging makes use of two-photon microscopy with a 100-femtosecond pulsed laser sources to observe structure and dynamics throughout the upper ~ 500 micrometers of cortex of mice. Yet there is a clear need to image throughout the full depth of cortex, 1.0 to 1.2 micrometers in mice, to determine the complete flow of information in cortical processing. There is also a need to image deeper still into hippocampus and other subcortical structures without excavated overlying tissue, as well as to determine the loci of vascular control throughout gray and while matter. The initial proposed experiments, all of which depend on the proposed instrument, address topics in fundamental brain science as well biomedicine. Fundamental issues revolve around neuronal plasticity and memory formation and include: the formation of motor memories, where the learning of a behavioral task is believed to follow from the formation of patterns of correlated neuronal output in motor cortex; the transformation of sensory signals in cortex into memory traces, such as learned fear via the amygdala and induction of depression via the habenula; the role of specific gene products, known as inducible transcription factors, in synaptic plasticity; and understanding how the prodigious adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb is integrated into ongoing olfactory function. More applied issues concern the role of exposure to nicotine alone in changing the basis for memory formation, as well as issues in vasodynamics, including the locus for neuronal control of its own nutriment supply through the cortical vasculature and the impact of microinfarctions on cell death within the white matter, where myelinated fibers traffic information from sensory to motor areas that span the cortical mantle. Realization of this system will permit training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in state of the art in vivo optical imaging. UC San Diego, along with the greater La Jolla scientific community, supports a large and highly collaborative neuroscience community with graduate students and fellows who will pursue careers at institutes throughout the county, even the world. They will be inspired to think of new experiments based on the capabilities of imaging new vistas in the brain, as well as new associated technologies, particularly in the design of optical probes of yet unmeasured variables. Lastly, the high density of potential users within this community will facilitate unanticipated refinements of deep imaging and perhaps transform the proposed development project into a turn-key design for the benefit of the global neurosciences communities. <br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes to build an instrument, whose design is motivated by three threads of work, that enables two- and three-photon imaging throughout the full depth of cortex and into deeper structures. First is the use of 100-fs pulsed laser light at wavelengths of 1.3 or 1.7 micrometers, where scattering is minimized but absorption by water is still weak; second is the use of an optical amplifier to increase the energy per pulse and drive fluorescence at greater depths, and third is the use of aberration corrective optics to counteract distortion of the incident beam with increasing depth into brain tissue."

Although General Relativity provides an extremely well-tested framework for describing gravitational effects at large distances, it cannot provide consistently a description of gravity at small scales where quantum effects are prevalent. The development of a quantum theory of gravity is a central goal of fundamental physics, with broad implications for our understanding of particle physics and the mysterious nature of the ""dark energy"" that appears to permeate the universe. Many theories attempting to provide a consistent microscopic framework for gravity (e.g., those involving extra dimensions) predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law at sub-millimeter distances. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitational interactions at microscopic distances.  This project represents an attempt to do this.   At the same time, while the direct scientific goals of this program are clearly central to the development of modern physics, the general investigation of the technique should enrich many other fields of science and technology. The ability to trap and control small objects in vacuum using laser beams is being explored for applications in quantum control, quantum computing and in the general area of detection of small forces. In addition the work will require the detailed understanding of residual electromagnetic interactions between the microspheres and the materials composing the attractors, and it is conceivable that progress in this area may enable new techniques for measuring properties of surfaces that are not yet accessible by probes such as Atomic Force Microscopes. Finally, the students (graduate and undergraduate) exposed to the project will receive a very complete training in many areas of science and technology.<br/><br/>Previous measurements at these distance scales have employed techniques derived from human-size devices in which mechanical springs are used as force sensors. We propose in this project to develop a drastically new technique, using the light field of a laser to confine and measure the motion of micron (or, eventually, submicron) size quartz nanosphere. This technique takes advantage of the modern development of optical tweezers, which has produced significant advances in biology and polymer science. By confining the nanospheres in vacuum and cooling them to low temperatures through active feedback of the trapping laser, the nanospheres can be decoupled from the room temperature environment, significantly reducing thermal and vibrational noise sources. The nanosphere oscillates in the harmonic potential of the optical trap, and its interaction with attractor masses positioned several microns away can be measured by studying the motion of the microsphere. The use of a light field in lieu of a mechanical spring affords much greater flexibility. Backgrounds can be mitigated through careful selection of the materials used for the attractors and the coating of the attractors with appropriate shielding layers. We have already cooled 5 micro-meter diameter microspheres to mK temperatures and demonstrated force sensitivities of 10^-17 N/sqrt(Hz).  We have recently published a paper in Phys Rev Lett showing that the nanospheres can be easily discharged and setting a new limit on the existence of particles with very small fractional charges. In the course of this project we expect to be able to study the Casimir effect and, in general, residual electromagnetic interactions between the nanospheres and the attractors and perform a first competitive gravity measurement."

This has led to a deep understanding of the physics that distinguishes between, for example, superconductors and magnets, while also informing why the former is essential for biomedical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the latter used in electrical transformers. These insights are typically rooted in the assumption of thermal equilibrium. When equilibration fails, so does much of our understanding. This CAREER award supports basic research into utilizing quantum mechanical building blocks --- composed of atoms, ions, molecules and photons --- to explore new phases of matter that can emerge in strongly-interacting systems which are out-of-equilibrium. To this end, the PI will explore two complementary directions. The first direction focuses on quantum mechanical systems where strong disorder prevents equilibrium from ever being reached. A key question in this context is whether one can realize novel, intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases of matter. The second direction focuses on understanding the way in which quantum systems that do equilibrate, manage to do so. A particular question of interest is whether there exists a ""speed limit"" on equilibration and if so, whether experimental AMO systems with long-range interactions can reach this limit. Alongside these research goals, the PI will implement a multi-layered outreach program aimed at training, recruiting and retaining high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the physical sciences. A particular focus will be the establishment of a research immersion initiative and summer internship program aimed at helping undergraduate students from two-year colleges gain hands-on research experience. The project also includes funding for a tailored mentorship program focused on teaching undergraduate and graduate students effective skills for science communication, enabling them to become advocates for science literacy in society. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: The last decade has seen the atomic, molecular and optical physics community make remarkable progress in the controlled manipulation of individual quanta. These advances have opened the door for the bottom-up realization of quantum many-body systems as well as the development of novel quantum technologies. This CAREER award supports basic research focused on utilizing the quantum optics toolbox associated with cold-atomic gases to explore topological phases, thermalization, and quantum dynamics in non-equilibrium systems. The non-equilibrium dynamics of entanglement and correlations remain some of the most poorly understood facets of quantum mechanics. To this end, the PI will explore new ""universality classes"" of quantum phases and dynamics, using a combination of analytic theoretical tools, state-of-the-art numerical computations, and experiments. In particular, the PI will characterize symmetry breaking and topological orders in strongly-interacting, periodically-driven, Floquet systems. While such periodic driving has emerged as a versatile tool in the quantum engineering of modern atomic systems, it remains an open question what specific types of novel phases can be realized in such Floquet systems. In addition, the PI will investigate foundational issues associated with the local quantum control of many-body systems. The proposed study will focus on leveraging tools from atomic and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, such as quantum phase estimation and quantum non-demolition measurement, to manipulate many-body excitations in disordered out-of-equilibrium systems. These research directions will also help to strengthen interdisciplinary connections between AMO physicists and condensed matter / quantum information scientists, as well as to provide a bridging dialogue between theoretical concepts and experimental implementations."

This project will thus ultimately contribute to the scientific community's ability to understand and model space weather, which includes disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that have the potential to damage power grids. In addition, this project will contribute to the training of future scientists by supporting the research team's involvement in, and organization of, the annual Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) Workshop. This Workshop attracts roughly 200 attendees, of whom approximately 60 are students. The Workshop provides students with specialized training in space science and helps integrate students into the community of space-science researchers. The principal investigator of the project will teach in summer schools for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the fields of plasma physics and space physics. The principal investigator will also incorporate research findings from this project into his teaching of physics and astronomy at the University of New Hampshire. These activities will contribute to the development of a strong science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM) workforce, which will benefit society at large.<br/><br/>The particular scientific focus of the project's turbulence research is on the phenomenon of intermittency and its effects upon solar-wind turbulence.  Intermittency is a property of turbulent flows in which random fluctuations in, for example, the velocity of the medium (``eddies'') become concentrated into a decreasing fraction of the volume as the size of the eddies decreases. Intermittency profoundly impacts almost every aspect of solar-wind turbulence, from the rate at which it heats the interplanetary medium to the mechanisms by which turbulent energy is transferred to the different types of charged particles contained in the solar wind. To tackle this problem, the research team will employ a range of methodologies, including mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and they will test their theoretical predictions using spacecraft measurements."

When gas is compressed, its temperature increases. However, the increase in temperature might be less if there are other degrees of freedom that absorb the energy.  Suppose, for example, that the gas energy resides mainly in whirling eddies, rather than in completely random motion. We ask the question whether there are conditions under which compression of the gas might increase this eddy energy. The significance of this question is that energy in eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction. That means that there would be fewer times that gas molecules would make high-impact head-on collisions.  Important processes such as nuclear fusion depend on this relative motion, so the fusion reactions would be fewer in gases where the energy resides in whirling eddies rather than in random thermal motion. If this were true, then one might also speculate that the effect could be used advantageously in controlling nuclear fusion in a highly compressed plasma.  <br/><br/>This project investigates the possibility of storing and then suddenly releasing the energy that can be deposited into turbulent fluid eddies in a plasma. It is conjectured that, under compression on a time scale in which viscosity may be neglected, the energy in such eddies might increase. Also, if the energy resides in hydrodynamic eddies rather than ion temperature, it means that it is unavailable to electrons through collisions. Thus, this energy cannot be easily captured by electrons and radiated. If the compression increases eddy energy more than the random energy, a new paradigm for storing energy in a highly compressed plasma might be advanced in which the energy content is increased under compression in a non-radiating plasma, and then suddenly released under viscous dissipation. To test these speculations, particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to describe compressing turbulent eddies, with guidance obtained from Z-pinch experiments that already appear to exhibit certain features of a turbulent inviscid plasma.  This work will involve a collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation.

However, there also exist many examples where a reductionistic method does not provide a complete picture.  As more and more parts are added, new phenomena may emerge at different stages and these new phenomena cannot be fully understood from the properties of the simpler system that precedes it.  Such emergent behavior is well known in science.  <br/><br/>The system of cold atoms represents an ideal platform to investigate the emergent phenomena.  Experimentally, several labs have developed techniques to accurately control the number of atoms in their atom traps, from one, to a few, to many.  This is made possible by the exquisite controllability of cold atoms.  The proposed research aims to provide a theoretical understanding of various cold atomic systems.  The central theme is to study how the properties of single atoms affect the physics of a few-atom or a many-atom system. <br/><br/>This research is of fundamental nature --- the basic science of cold atoms.  Fundamental issues that will be addressed include: How does an atom or an ensemble of atoms interact with a quantum field of light?  Will an ensemble of atoms that are interacting with each other and prepared out of equilibrium reach equilibrium?  If so, how?  When the inter-atomic interaction becomes very strong, what exotic properties will emerge?  Many of these issues are at the forefront of the field of cold atoms and quantum many-body systems.  This work will therefore significantly advance the relevant fields.                                                                                                                                                                    <br/><br/>In this project, the connection among single-body, few-body and many-body physics using the platform of cold atoms is investigated. There are four main topic areas: cold atoms inside an optical cavity, coupling both the internal and the external degrees of freedom of the atoms; cold atoms subject to synthetic spin-orbit coupling; quantum magnetism with 1D quantum gases; and far-off-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Each of these topics represents a relatively independent research direction, though there also are strong connections among different topics.  A number of different theoretical techniques will be used to tackle these problems, including the mean-field method, the variational method, perturbation calculations, exact diagonalization, time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) for example."

A study of the fundamental mechanisms of complex and inter-related processes by which a plasma discharge initiates, interacts and sustains in the liquid medium will also have substantial benefits outside the field of plasma science. Unique and critical technologies envisioned to have the greatest impact are biomedical - wound healing and sterilization, electronics - nano-particle synthesis, and energy efficiency - high-efficiency combustion from liquid fuel reforming.<br/><br/>This project will computationally investigate plasma discharges in liquids using advanced numerical methods in conjunction with high-performance computing resources.

A multi-dimensional, multi-physics model will be developed and employed to determine the role and importance of low-density region/bubble for plasma discharge in non-polar and polar liquids, production and spatiotemporal evolution of reactive species in a multi-phase medium, and phase change due to coupled ponderomotive forces and ohmic heating effects.  The main outcomes of this effort are expected to be a major leap in the predictive modeling capability for non-thermal plasma discharges in liquid/dense medium, new course material on multi-physics modeling to increase the education impact for engineering students, ""YouTube""-based introductory short modules on plasma science, and outreach activities to inspire under-represented students and the general public towards STEM."

Examples of DFT applications range from inventing materials of specific functions, to understanding chemical reactions for better products, to designing drugs to cure cancers. The success of DFT relies on the accuracy of the approximation of how particles in a material interact with each other, the so-called exchange-correlation (XC) free-energy density functional. So far, most of the available XC-functionals have been limited to zero-temperature cases. In this research project, finite-temperature XC-functionals will be developed to significantly improve the predictive capability of DFT for plasma-physics and materials studies. The outcome of this research project is expected to make a significant difference in a variety of scientific fields and applications such as planetary science, astrophysics, fusion-energy and national defense applications, as well as to make a positive impact on the society through delivering tools for discovering better materials and designing efficient drugs.<br/><br/>Matter at warm dense conditions exists vastly in the universe -- from shocks and inertial confinement fusion implosions created in laboratories to planetary cores and astrophysical objects such as brown and white dwarfs. Thorough understanding of the properties of warm-dense matter, non-ideal and ""exotic"" plasmas hold the key to unravel many mysteries in planetary and astrophysical sciences; for example, the possible H-He demixing on Saturn. Reliably predicting the transport and optical properties of matter at such extreme conditions heavily depends on the accuracy of XC functionals required by the DFT method. In this project, a three-step research program will be established to develop accurate finite-temperature hybrid XC-functionals by: (i) Assessing the available thermal free-energy functional performance to identify the state conditions wherein those current functionals fail; (ii) Developing thermal-hybrid and thermal-screened hybrid XC functionals that correspond to those proven to be accurate for the energy gap in the zero-temperature case; and (iii) Applying the developed thermal hybrid XC-functionals to warm-dense-plasma simulations to benchmark with experiments and deliver a useful software to the broad computational science community. In particular, the PIs will release the resulting software package as open source and incorporate it into the standard distribution for the existing Quantum-Espresso and ABINIT computational packages. This will allow a wider growth of the project.

Plasma assisted materials processing is largely responsible for the impressive progress that continues to be made in production of microelectronics devices of ever increasing capability. Plasma etching is the only known, industrially implementable method to fabricate the nanometer sized features in logic and memory chips. During plasma etching, fluxes of ions and neutral particles are directed towards the wafer being processed. The energy and angle of impact of the particles onto the surface of wafers are the critical parameters for the fabrication of microelectronic devices, as well as nanostructured and biocompatible materials. Control of these parameters allows for finer control of the surface composition and, in microelectronics fabrication, etch rate. Low temperature plasmas for plasma materials processing have traditionally used continuously excited plasmas. However, all major semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers are predicting that pulsed plasmas will be the enabling technology for achieving sub-10 nanometer feature sizes.  The most direct impact of this research is addressing fundamental science issues that are of paramount importance to the plasma processing of high performance microelectronics, nanostructures and biocompatible materials. In addition to the technological broader impacts, this project will be highly focused on educational outreach.  Prof. Gekelman is one of the founders of LAPTAG (Los Angeles Physics Teachers Alliance Group) and several LAPTAG students and will be involved in these plasma processing studies. Prof. Kushner, director of the Michigan Institute of Plasma Science and Engineering, will leverage those resources to launch the Plasma Picture of the Day website with the goal of providing informative images of plasmas to educate the general public and school children about plasmas.<br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of pulsed plasma systems is the current impediment to widespread adoption. For example, instabilities and waves are nearly universally observed in pulsed plasmas, and particularly in electronegative plasmas, which sometimes prevents operation in desirable parameters spaces. The sources of these instabilities and the means to prevent them are not understood. Pulsed plasma processing can be arbitrarily complex. For example, modern capacitively coupled plasma etching tools may be driven by up to 3 separate power supplies at different frequencies which can be pulsed independently at different repetition rates and different duty cycles. The combinations of parameters can number into the millions. This extremely large parameter space places a large premium on having a fundamental understanding of pulsed plasma processing and so be able to predict plasma performance. In this research project, a highly collaborative experimental-modeling effort will investigate the fundamental properties of pulsed plasmas as used in materials processing, with an emphasis on instabilities and waves, diagnosing and modeling the dynamics of the transition from interpulse afterglow to powered plasma, and the means to improve uniformity through pulsing. Laser induced fluorescence will be used to characterize the trajectory of ions as they are accelerated through the transient sheaths produced by pulsed plasmas; and will be correlated with Langmuir probe measurements of plasma properties. Multi-dimensional computer modeling will be validated by these measurements and will be further used to illuminate fundamental issues related to plasma transport in pulsed systems."

Understanding the properties of these materials is paramount to developing numerical models capable of predicting star formation and planetary collisions.  These models also help scientists to assess the potential for life on planets outside of our solar system.  Currently, the scientific community knows very little about interstellar body materials since they do not occur naturally on Earth.  However, pieces of celestial-like matter can be produced and studied in the laboratory using the type of instrumentation to be developed by this project.  The instrument to be developed, High Amperage Driver for Extreme States (HADES), can generate power equivalent to hundreds of electrical power plants in a fraction of a second, requiring very little energy to produce matter under extreme pressure.  HADES' novel design combines an efficient architecture with a compact footprint, packing this extreme power in a device slightly bigger than an automobile.  Thus, HADES can be used in a university setting, which normally does not have the capacity to study matter under these conditions.  The system will also be sufficiently mobile to be placed at other facilities, where more diagnostics may be available for measuring the properties of matter under extreme pressure.  Understanding such materials will have a profound impact on many areas of life, such as developing new materials, harnessing fusion energy, and the discovery of life on other planets.  The innovative design of HADES, its construction, and its operation will also foster new talent in physics and engineering, keeping the U.S. at the forefront of fundamental science and discovery. <br/><br/>The frontiers of physical exploration have come to understanding the infinitely small (quantum mechanics), and the infinitely large (astrophysics): the physics of extremes.  The next step in ground-breaking discoveries faces a big challenge: studying matter that does not exist naturally on Earth because it is too dense to be stable at atmospheric pressures or much too large to fit in a laboratory.  To solve this problem, scientists need to develop new instruments capable of handling the high-energy densities required to produce such matter.  The High Amperage Driver for Extreme States (HADES) is a 250 GW pulsed-power driver designed to produce and investigate this kind of matter.  This driver can generate currents of 1.2 MA in 250 ns.  The driver's innovative design is compact and can be moved to any major US facility where x-ray light sources can probe the matter HADES will generate.  The intellectual merit of the research program enabled by HADES is grounded in three complementary research directions, in harmony with NSF's vision for future scientific investments: quantum-degenerate materials, exotic astrophysical objects, and astrobiology.  The high-power density and versatility of HADES promotes a symbiotic, diversified research program across physics, astrophysics, engineering and planetary science by defining the physical properties of macroscopic samples of warm, quantum-degenerate matter, studying the impact of intense magnetic fields on hot, turbulent astrophysical flows, and understanding the connections between geochemistry and planetary habitability. The experimental investigation of extreme states of matter using HADES will have broader impacts on the scientific community and the public. Transport coefficient models, validated experimentally, will be directly applicable to astrophysics, inertial fusion confinement, and planetary science.  The construction and operation of HADES, as well as the research it enables, are also instrumental in training new generations of students in extreme-state physics and pulsed-power engineering.  Ultimately this project will strengthen the national research program in extreme state physics and allow heretofore inaccessible physics of the Cosmos to be studied in the laboratory."

Plasmas in and in contact with liquids are one of the most exciting and important intellectual frontiers in plasma science, with broad potential applications ranging from environmental remediation and green chemistry to biomedical applications. The complex interaction of plasmas with liquids offers a rich source of short-lived chemically reactive species, many of which are critical for chemical and biological applications. Plasmas are often considered to be an advanced oxidation technology for liquid waste treatment and also have great promise in the destruction of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. The presence of these pharmaceuticals in the water supply is an increasing public concern and for several cases no alternative technologies exist to remove them from drinking water. In addition, plasmas in liquids can be used for environmentally friendly chemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen and even nanoparticles. Producing hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide from water with better energy efficiency than electrolysis or other chemical processes would be a major step forward.  The nanoparticles in the context of advanced material science could also strongly affect energy research that increasingly uses complex nanostructured materials. <br/><br/>Since energy efficiency is often a bottleneck for applications of plasmas in liquids, a better understanding of the reactive species production in these plasmas is the necessary step to lead to a breakthrough in technologies based on plasmas in liquids. To date, progress in the field of plasmas in liquids has been hindered by the lack of quantitative correlations between plasma properties and the plasma induced liquid phase chemistry. The key idea of this project is to generate a non-equilibrium plasma filament in liquid water by a nanosecond pulsed high voltage supply in a needle-needle electrode geometry. This offers an excellent control of the plasma dynamics and allows detailed investigation of a stabilized plasma filament. The short-lived reactive species production mechanisms will be investigated both temporally and spatially resolved by a combination of advanced laser diagnostics. In addition, plasma induced liquid reactivity will be measured and a direct link between plasma chemistry and liquid phase chemistry will be established. This is expected to lead to the necessary knowledge for optimizing and establishing many promising applications as stated above.  This project enables education of students and a post-doctoral researcher in the cross-disciplinary field of plasma engineering. The outcomes of this work will be used to extend an existing graduate course on Plasma Technology to cover non-equilibrium liquid phase plasmas including laboratory demonstrations.

Bose fireworks occur when dense samples of ultracold gas known as Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) emit jets of matterwaves in different directions, making formations reminiscent of fireworks.   Such behavior is stimulated by subjecting the BEC to periodic modulations in potential energy.  This project will investigate in detail how Bose fireworks occur, and how correlations between the strength and direction of the jets develop.   This can serve as a model for universal behavior of a quantum many-body system driven far from thermal equilibrium, and may pioneer a new type of quantum simulation.  This is important because it can address fundamental issues in nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and even cosmology.   Graduate students engaged in this project will be trained in cutting edge atomic physics research techniques.  This team will also disseminate research excitement to broader audiences, including underrepresented minority (URM) K-12 students and undergraduate students on the south side of Chicago via an outreach activity that provides week-long science activities in summer.  Another educational activity as part of this project will be the establishment of a new undergraduate-led laboratory for innovative experimentation, called ""Undergraduate Research Center on Levitation Science"".   The laboratory will offer unique opportunities for many talented undergraduate students to innovate and be involved in the development of new ideas that can potentially impact fundamental science and interdisciplinary applications.<br/><br/>This project will study novel correlations of matterwave emissions recently observed in driven Bose-Einstein condensates. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering length, a firework-like emission of matterwave jets is found to reveal rich, intricate correlations between the populations in different momentum modes. The emission resembles the matterwave version of superradiance in a dense sample, and is theoretically predicted to be a universal signature for driven quantum many-body system far from thermal equilibrium. This team will investigate the stimulated emission of matterwaves in both Bose condensates and Bose-Fermi mixtures. The fireworks can be a powerful tool to probe weak quantum fluctuations and correlations. This team will also develop a new scheme to realize an interaction-dependent synthetic gauge field by combining the modulation of scattering length and the shaking of a 2D optical lattice. This will test a prediction that the scattering length modulation will hybridize the Floquet bands in the two lattice directions and will lead to an interaction-dependent D4 and D2 symmetry breaking that would not occur for non-interacting bosons. The interaction-driven gauge field is an essential step to couple matter and gauge fields and to explore quantum simulation of dynamical gauge fields and anyonic excitations based on atomic quantum gases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of weakly interacting particles is at the forefront of both fields and is the primary objective of experiments at the Lab.  The Lab is hosted in a Minnesota State Park, where each year approximately 4,000 of the Park's visitors venture 2,341 feet underground to see the facility. The main experiments include the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS).   MINOS is a long-baseline neutrino experiment designed to observe the phenomena of neutrino oscillations, an effect which is related to neutrino mass. The CDMS detectors operating at Soudan are for a series of experiments designed directly to detect particle dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).<br/><br/>Two high school science teachers and three undergraduate interns will work in the lab over the summer. Their primary duty is to help give the twice-daily ""physics tours"" and explain the lab and the science to visitors of the park. They will then use this experience and their science education skills to improve the lab's outreach program and develop lesson plans and educational materials for use by the many school groups which visit the lab on field trips during the school year. They will also participate in research projects with the experiments in the lab, not only the larger MINOS and CDMS projects but several smaller ones involved with Research and Development for low background measurements. A half-time outreach coordinator works year round with school and community groups.  This award will also support the annual Open House at the lab."

Many diseased cellular states (including cancer and autoimmunity) are associated with aberrant regulation of transcription of genes regulated by super-enhancers (SEs), large clusters of enhancers that regulate the transcription of genes important for cell type specific processes in both healthy and diseased (e.g., cancer) states.. Therefore, the proposed fundamental studies are of significance to the design of therapies for diseases that have a large toll on human health. The immediate potential impact of the studies concerns inhibitors of SEs that are currently being tested in clinical trials to treat cancer and other diseases. This effort also has an important training component.  Undergraduate research is an integral part of labs at MIT. Formal mechanisms such as the MIT Undergraduate Opportunities Program (UROP), the MIT Summer Research Program and Amgen Scholars Program for underrepresented minorities, will be used to recruit undergraduates to the PI's laboratories. One PI will also participate in ACCESS, a weekend at MIT for underrepresented minority students designed to make them aware of opportunities for graduate study. The impact of this research on science and technology will be disseminated to the broader scientific community through the production of a video learning module targeted at both the broad community of citizens and specifically the K-12 educational audience.  MIT has been at the epicenter of research at the convergence of the physical, life, and engineering sciences. The PIs will teach courses wherein this interdisciplinary work will be highlighted.<br/><br/>Super-enhancers are occupied by an unusually high density of interacting molecules, and are able to drive higher levels of transcription than typical enhancers. Several lines of evidence suggest that they form via cooperative processes, and SEs are far more vulnerable than typical enhancers to perturbation of components that are commonly associated with most enhancers. Recently, the PIs proposed that a phase separated multi-molecular assembly regulates the formation and function of SEs (Cell, 2017). They suggested that some puzzles associated with SE function are consistent with such a model. These results provide just a starting point to explore the role of phase separation in gene control in mammals. By bringing together sophisticated theoretical studies (rooted in statistical physics) and biological experiments, the PIs now aim to study their novel proposal with the goal of developing a conceptual framework for understanding gene regulation in mammals, and why SEs evolved to regulate key genes. The mechanistic insights thus gleaned will also apply to diverse processes in eukaryotic cells that are mediated by phase separated membraneless organelles. By bringing together approaches rooted in physics and biology, the PIs aim to address the following significant questions: 1] What are the fundamental physical and biological principles that determine how SEs form and function to regulate gene transcription in mammals? 2] Why have genes with the most prominent roles in cell identity evolved to be regulated by SEs? 3] Why do cancer cells have SE-regulated oncogenes, and why are these so vulnerable to drugs that inhibit certain transcriptional regulators? In order to take steps toward answering these questions, the PIs propose to study two major topics: 1] Understanding the nature of the phase transition and its implications for gene regulation. 2] Understanding how super-enhancers nucleate and form.<br/><br/>This RAISE project is being jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, by the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate, and by the Office of Integrative Activities."

The ACP also organizes between five and eight one-week Winter Conferences, bringing together as many as 100 researchers each week to respond to rapidly breaking developments in areas of current interest in physics and interdisciplinary research.  As a result of this intense activity, each year over 500 journal articles, book chapters and scientific manuscripts explicitly acknowledge the ACP for the birth of new ideas, for the formation and nurturing of collaborations, for the opportunity to concentrate on advancing or completing work, and for essential ingredients contributed by fellow researchers to overcome roadblocks to progress.   Thus funding for the ACP advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science across a variety of subdisciplines of physics. <br/><br/>In both summer and winter, participating physicists also contribute to a rich and visible science outreach program.  Each winter conference features a free public lecture with a typical attendance of 200, preceded by a ""Physics Caf"" in which two to three conference participants engage with an audience of 50 to 100.  Each summer, ten to twelve free public talks are held on the ACP campus, with typical attendance close to 100.  All lectures and talks are recorded, shown on local television, and made available on the ACP web site.  Weekly ""Physics is for Kids"" summer barbeques, co-hosted with the Aspen Science Center, feature hands-on activities and an interactive demonstration/talk by an ACP participant.  Also in the summer, 14 top physics students from local high schools work at the ACP for a week each and meet one-on-one with physicists to discuss STEM interests and careers."

The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples. It is possible that evidence for BSM physics could emerge at this higher energy and with the higher event statistics from the current run and by means of further upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS to follow.<br/><br/>Analytically, the NYU group will be studying Higgs decays, searching for evidence of supersymmetry and exotic new states of matter through several approaches, including the reaction process known as Vector Boson Fusion, and will be developing novel approaches to the reconstruction and study of high energy Jets.  NYU will partner with the Weizmann Institute of Science through support from the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation program to search for the decays of Higgs boson decays to charm quark pairs, through heavy flavor tagging.   Here the joint NYU-Weizmann effort will exploit advanced machine learning techniques to identify and select such challenging final states in Higgs decay. <br/><br/>Technical projects include improvements and refinements of the ATLAS trigger for missing energy, a key variable in the searches for new physics, and track triggering, an essential technique for dealing with reconstruction of events in very high rate collisions, which are endemic at the LHC.  The group also helps to lead a smaller experimental effort called milliQan, whose objective is to search for fractionally charged particles that might be produced at the LHC.<br/><br/>The NYU group's broader impacts efforts are extensive.  For general audiences, the NYU exhibit on the LHC is estimated to reach large numbers of school-age children, and the ""Higgs Hunters"" project has engaged users from a variety of age groups in significant numbers.  For secondary school educators, workshops are also planned at NYU to familiarize and educate teachers with some of the state of the art tools used in the particle physics domain, to provide them with background to bring new knowledge to the classroom.

Advancements in nonlinear optical spectroscopy and metrology that rely on intrinsically quantum mechanical effects are of broad scientific interest to the chemistry, physics and engineering communities. The methods and research so developed will create new opportunities that may be utilized in the expanding interdisciplinary field of quantum information science. The supported research will facilitate the dissemination of results at international meetings and workshops, and the tools developed will be made readily available to the scientific community. The three PIs will collaborate on all aspects of the proposed work, and will co-advise the PhD students working on the projects. The students involved will thus enjoy a unique and broad exposure to research training that spans quantum optics, ultrafast molecular spectroscopy, and biophysics.<br/><br/>An interdisciplinary team spanning chemistry, physics, and engineering in the Oregon Center for Optical, Molecular, and Quantum Science, will carry out experiments to demonstrate that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-like entanglement of photons in the time-frequency domain can provide a significant quantum advantage in spectroscopy and metrology. Time-frequency entangled photon pairs (EPP) are tightly correlated in time while being anti-correlated in frequency, such that the sum of the energies of the photon pair is sharply defined. Such quantum states of light offer the ability to circumvent classical Fourier time-bandwidth limits when employing photon coincidence events, either in detection, as in standard quantum optics, or in two-photon excitation of molecular complexes, as in nonlinear spectroscopy. The research will investigate potential quantum advantages in the context of four related optical schemes in metrology and nonlinear spectroscopy: 1) Quantum illumination (sensing of an object's presence or absence); 2) Multi-parameter estimation of complementary parameters (e.g., estimating the distance and velocity of a reflecting object); 3) Two-photon interferometric nonlinear spectroscopy; and 4) Entangled photon-pair 2D fluorescence spectroscopy. The commonality that unifies the four schemes is the use of broad-band (multi-spectral-mode), time-frequency EPP produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), coupled with interferometer configurations that exploit quantum interference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AMO Physics is also an enabling discipline connecting with several areas of science in condensed matter physics, chemistry, astrophysics, plasma and nuclear physics, and biology. With a new quantum revolution underway, spurred by remarkable advances in exquisite precision and control of interactions between atomic species and manipulation and study of the coherent properties of light and matter, a center of excellence in AMO theory will serve as the integrator of activities in helping lead this revolution in quantum technologies.

New experimental and theoretical tools are needed to develop a predictive understanding of the regulatory processes that control the outputs of these complex cellular networks. Current approaches focus on correlations between the components of the system (such as genetic composition, expression levels, metabolite concentrations), however such correlations alone are usually insufficient to develop strategies for robust control of the state and function of diverse microbial communities. In this project the PI will use multiscale approach that combines theoretical predictions with precision experimental tests to quantitatively understand how individual and groups of cells reach decisions to coordinate global behavior within microbial ecosystems. Tackling modern societal challenges related to health, agriculture, and the environment will benefit from a predictive understanding of how multiple components of a network work together, particularly for complex networks involving many densely connected components. To inspire the next generation of scientists to take up problems on the physics of systems and complexity, the PI has partnered with a local science non-profit to design and implement hands-on learning activities related to the biophysics of signal exchange. Students will gain an intuitive understanding of the physical principles that govern cellular networks, including insight into how network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals within a population. Themes of this research will also appear in an undergraduate general education course focused on training undergraduates from diverse background, including non-science majors, in essential quantitative skills intrinsic to the physical sciences.<br/><br/>The PI will examine the exchange of variant quorum sensing signals within diverse microbial networks to understand how signaling interactions between individual strains give rise to emergent properties of the network. An artificial neural network model predicts the impact of crosstalk between cell types on system-level signaling states. The stability of these signal-driven regulatory states will be examined in both models and experiments to gauge the potential to direct the outputs of multispecies networks through perturbations of species composition or signal exchange pathways. This combination of theory and experiment illuminates how systems-level behaviors such as robustness emerge from the collective action of multiple cell types working together.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To continue this growth, it is critical to explore and vet new approaches for increasing computational power. Quantum computers are a promising form of advanced computational power, providing unmatched advantages in code breaking and scientific simulation problems in fields such as molecular chemistry and materials science. Quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, and the hardware development is nearing a level of sophistication where it is possible to construct a quantum computer that may outperform classical computers in solving certain problems. The Software-Tailored Architecture for Quantum co-design (STAQ) project brings together a group of physicists, computer scientists, and engineers to construct a quantum computer capable of showing an advantage over current computer technology.  The project also supports the development of educational tools and a quantum information workforce.<br/><br/>A quantum computer can exhibit an advantage over standard computers when the quantum computer is large enough that brute force simulation strategies become infeasible and a quantum algorithm is sufficiently complex that approximate computational methods do not provide accurate results. The STAQ project aims to utilize this quantum advantage by building ion trap quantum computers with 64 or more qubits and developing quantum algorithms suitable for noisy quantum devices.  This ambitious task will be enabled by a software stack that optimally maps the quantum algorithms onto the ion trap device and allows for the algorithms and hardware to be designed together. The project requires a wide range of expertise to achieve the scientific goal. The team consists of ion trap experimentalists, quantum information theorists, and computer architects.  STAQ will organize a Quantum Ideas School, which will recruit a diverse group of students into quantum information and help retrain current industrial scientists for this emerging field. This project advances the objectives of two of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: ""The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution"" and ""Growing Convergent Research at NSF"". The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known. This project also advances the third objective of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI), an effort aimed at developing new technological capabilities in the post-Moore's Law era.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research in string theory in the past three decades has led to exciting new insights in physics and mathematics. Considering string propagation in nontrivial backgrounds produces physical interpretations for mathematical structures in spacetime. The interplay between mathematical and physical intuitions and techniques has enriched both fields. A notable example of this is the discovery and the many applications of mirror symmetry, a surprising relation between two distinct spaces that lead to indentical physics when used as string backgrounds. Plesser's research will build on these results and on recent progress in both fields to pursue these studies in new regimes. This work will be done in collaboration with physicists and mathematicians around the world, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in a particularly interdisciplinary direction.   Plesser will also train graduate students and involve undergraduate students in the research.  Plesser will also collaborate with local public schools to enhance science teaching and generate enthusiasm for science in young people through visits to the classroom to present specific curriculum materials developed in concert with the schools. These curriculum materials are made broadly available for use elsewhere.  Moreover, the regular public stargazing events conducted by Plesser for the past decade will be enhanced by including astrophotography capabilities.<br/><br/>More technically, Plesser will pursue various approaches to better understand the structure of the moduli space of string vacua with four unbroken supersymmetries. This includes perturbative heterotic vacua and the (0,2) superconformal field theories associated to these, as well as F-theory and M-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Each of these formulations gives a simple description of a region of the moduli space, and the relation between the two descriptions in regions of overlap is of particular interest."

CeNTREX is a collaborative effort to detect evidence for new types of fundamental forces and particles, through precise measurements of magnetic resonance signals from nuclei embedded in the polar molecule thallium fluoride. The goal of the CeNTREX experiment is to detect a particular deformation in the shape of an atomic nucleus, known as a nuclear Schiff Moment. This will advance the progress of science because a Schiff Moment along the spin axis of a nucleus can arise only in the presence of fundamental interactions that are not symmetric under reversal of the direction of time. Interactions of this type can be mediated by new, as-yet undetected, particles that are predicted to occur in some theoretical models that extend the current Standard Model of particle physics. A Schiff Moment of size large enough to be detected with the projected sensitivity CeNTREX could indicate the existence of new particles with mass well above that of the heaviest known particles - and even beyond the reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Hence, CeNTREX will provide one of the few known ways to search for physics beyond the Standard Model associated with particles too massive to be created at the LHC.  An experiment with the fundamental discovery potential of CeNTREX can also capture the interest of the general public and raise the level of excitement about science. In addition, design and construction of the CeNTREX apparatus will provide opportunities for training several young scientists in instrumentation development. This type of precision measurement science exposes students to a wide range of intellectual and technical subfields, and provides unusually broad training in experimental physics that benefits development of the scientific workforce of the nation.<br/><br/>The existence of an asymmetric charge distribution such as an electric dipole moment (EDM) or a Schiff moment (SM) along a particle's angular momentum axis requires violation of time reversal (T) symmetry, which is equivalent to the more widely-discussed phenomenon of CP violation.  Observation of an EDM or SM within a few orders of magnitude of current limits would be evidence for phenomena outside the Standard Model of particle physics theory.  Furthermore, there are strong motivations from particle theory and cosmology to expect an EDM or SM in this experimentally-accessible range.  Discovery of an EDM or SM could illuminate the mechanism responsible for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, which remains one of the grand challenges of cosmology and particle physics.  Moreover, new physics at the TeV scale (the range of energy not being explored at the LHC), carrying new CP-violating phases, naturally give rise to EDM and SM near the current experimental limits.  Hence any advance in sensitivity to SMs pushes the frontier of particle physics in a manner complementary to current efforts at the Large Hadron Collider.   The CeNTREX apparatus will be developed by integrating a wide array of subsystems - many custom designed and built - including vacuum systems, a molecular beam source, lasers, optical control and detection systems, microwave control and transmission systems, precise magnetic field measurement and control systems, and high voltage systems. The conceptual design of CeNTREX builds from recent advances using the properties of diatomic molecules to amplify signals due to new fundamental forces, and in precisely detecting and manipulating molecules.  This novel apparatus will use a cryogenic beam of diatomic molecules to make the world's most sensitive measurement of a SM.  Detailed estimates of the first-generation measurement using CeNTREX are projected to yield a 30-fold increase in sensitivity, relative to the current state of the art, to certain types of time-reversal symmetry violating interactions that could be responsible for the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CeNTREX is a collaborative effort to detect evidence for new types of fundamental forces and particles, through precise measurements of magnetic resonance signals from nuclei embedded in the polar molecule thallium fluoride. The goal of the CeNTREX experiment is to detect a particular deformation in the shape of an atomic nucleus, known as a nuclear Schiff Moment. This will advance the progress of science because a Schiff Moment along the spin axis of a nucleus can arise only in the presence of fundamental interactions that are not symmetric under reversal of the direction of time. Interactions of this type can be mediated by new, as-yet undetected, particles that are predicted to occur in some theoretical models that extend the current Standard Model of particle physics. A Schiff Moment of size large enough to be detected with the projected sensitivity CeNTREX could indicate the existence of new particles with mass well above that of the heaviest known particles - and even beyond the reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Hence, CeNTREX will provide one of the few known ways to search for physics beyond the Standard Model associated with particles too massive to be created at the LHC.  An experiment with the fundamental discovery potential of CeNTREX can also capture the interest of the general public and raise the level of excitement about science. In addition, design and construction of the CeNTREX apparatus will provide opportunities for training several young scientists in instrumentation development. This type of precision measurement science exposes students to a wide range of intellectual and technical subfields, and provides unusually broad training in experimental physics that benefits development of the scientific workforce of the nation.<br/><br/>The existence of an asymmetric charge distribution such as an electric dipole moment (EDM) or a Schiff moment (SM) along a particle's angular momentum axis requires violation of time reversal (T) symmetry, which is equivalent to the more widely-discussed phenomenon of CP violation.

This is important because it will lay the foundation for technologies that can improve national security and economic competitiveness. It will also advance the field of quantum information science.  Broader impacts of this project include training of a graduate student in theoretical quantum optics methods and providing research experience for undergraduate students who will become part of the next generation of scientists.

Developing a science of cities to complement traditional, more qualitative approaches is urgently required to address global sustainability. Can we maintain a vibrant, innovative society driven by ideas and wealth creation or are we destined to a planet of slums, conflict and devastation? The ever-increasing pace of life and increasingly rapid rate of change driven by positive feedback mechanisms in social networks induces serious stress across all aspects of life. Is this sustainable or are we headed for major disruptions to the socio-economic fabric? To address these issues a new conceptual framework is needed, encompassing a quantitative theory of cities, a Grand Unified Theory of Sustainability that integrates across the multiplicity of challenges we face.<br/><br/>This is an ambitious program that transcends conventional disciplinary boundaries, ranging across the mathematical, physical, biological and social sciences, with potentially important implications for addressing societal issues such as aging, cancer, urbanization and global sustainability. The two main categories to be explored are i) a generic theory of aging, damage, sleep and repair; and (ii) developing a science of cities, urbanisation and global sustainability. Although the overall goal will be to explore the development of a potential unified framework for quantitative understanding of how these diverse, highly complex evolving systems can be understood from a parsimonious mathematically quantifiable set of underlying principles and concepts, this will be carried out in the context of focusing on several specific problems such as: how are lifetimes whose scale is years generated from microscopic molecular time scales associated with genes and respiratory enzymes? Why is the half-life of US publicly-traded companies about 10 years? Why, on average, do all companies and organisms stop growing and die but almost all cities keep growing and remain viable?

The materials stem from triply periodic constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces and their complements which form wire networks. This gives an effective theory for the Dirac equation on the CMC surface, the computation of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace operator on the graph of the wire network, the probing of a previously found noncommutative/commutative duality and the study of noncommutative topological invariants and the analogue of the quantum Hall effect for the wire networks.

The outcome may be useful in photovoltaics, leading to increased effectiveness of solar cells. <br/>The broader impact aspects of this project are inherent in its educational aspects and the subject matter of the proposed research which involves several fields of physics, as well as the interdisciplinary nature between the physical and mathematical sciences.

This innovative technique, dubbed SWAP cooling, employs extremely coherent lasers whose pure color is periodically modulated. Starting first as an accidental experimental discovery in the laboratory, this new technique promises to push back the frontier of what can be achieved in manipulating and controlling quantum gases, and to thereby have a broad range of potential applications in science and technology. This is not the first laser-cooling proposal; indeed the idea for using lasers to control and cool atomic gases has been explored extensively over the past two or three decades, and has led to the development of many methods that are used every day in atomic physics laboratories. However, this new approach has the potential to massively expand the range of atoms and molecules that can be considered for quantum science and quantum computation applications, and offers to improve state-of-the-art atomic clocks (used in such systems as GPS satellites for navigation). <br/><br/>The novel idea is based on the premise that the extreme coherence offered by systems that have two valence electrons (group-II elements and other similar atomic and molecular systems) offers a new and exciting frontier for laser sciences. In these systems, the presence of extremely weak dipole transitions causes the implementation of traditional laser-cooling approaches to be difficult due in part to the demanding stability requirements for the laser frequencies. The new idea here is that near-resonant laser fields can be used whose intensity or frequency may be modulated in time. This may amplify the effects of strong coherent forces while simultaneously reducing the role of dissipative and spontaneous scattering of photons that would otherwise increase the realizable temperatures. The aim is to achieve, say, a ten-fold improvement in frequency standards that translates directly into potential major improvements in current technologies, ranging from improved metrology, to advanced communication, to the next generation of precision devices for navigation and positioning systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments with elementary objects such as photons (constituents of light) or electrons (constituents of atoms) has led over the decades to many new technologies, including computers and lasers. The next generation of technology (called quantum technology), might create the means for ensuring perfect security of information on the internet, as well as computers that can solve problems unsolvable using today's hardware. Light, as a carrier of information, plays important roles in such technologies, so the ability to control light more and more finely is crucial for future success. The present study addresses the so-called nonlinear interactions of light that occurs in some substances or materials. For example, when very intense light of a certain color travels through a long solid-glass fiber, new colors can be created by nonlinear interactions. Such color-changing interactions have many uses, both in scientific research and in technological applications. A problem exists though, called ""Raman scattering,"" which leads to the production of many unwanted colors in addition to those desired.  In this type of scattering, energy is deposited in the vibrations of molecules making up the medium. These unwanted, randomly produced colors can degrade the purity of the light, so a means to avoid their production is an important goal. The present study is developing such a means by replacing solid-glass fibers with hollow glass fibers filled with xenon gas at extremely high pressure. Because xenon is a ""noble gas"" it does not form molecules, and so the Raman light scattering mechanism is absent. Optical physics and light-based information science (photonics) offer excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education.<br/><br/>From a more technical perspective, the project addresses the need in quantum optics research for attaining ideal interactions for generating and manipulating quantum-mechanical states of light, including single photons, entangled photons, squeezed states, and entangled states, as well as for performing quantum gate operations and implementing quantum communication methods. Toward these goals, this experimental project studies optical parametric processes using high-density atomic xenon gas confined in hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCF). Such a medium will open up the study of fundamental quantum optical processes without the often-deleterious presence of Raman scattering. Elimination of Raman scattering removes spontaneous photon emission background signals in single-photon sources, and removes Raman-induced frequency shifting in optical soliton propagation, which limits the degree of quantum noise squeezing that can be achieved. It also decreases pump-laser degradation. Such a system could lead to well-controlled nonlinear optical processes for quantum information schemes. Developing the means to manipulate and control the states of quantum systems is of broad interest in science and in quantum information technology, metrology, quantum chemistry, nano-mechanics, etc. The topic brings together quantum opticians with optical device scientists and material scientists."

Understanding the fundamental forces of nature has always been an important part of physics. While the first such force studied was the gravitational force and our understanding of this interaction is extremely precise for relatively large separations among the interacting bodies, its validity at short distances has only recently been tested. Furthermore, the possibility of undetected light bosons, elementary particles governing the interaction between spin polarized bodies, is very poorly constrained. The groups plans to undertake an effort to gain a better understanding of these issues. By combining sample development and very precise measurements of the interactions between a source and a test mass, a much better knowledge of the interaction strength and mass of potential light bosons will be gained. The PI and co-PI will continue to attract undergraduate and high school students in physics and engineering to participate in the proposed work. Graduate students involved in the project will also have supervisory duties over undergraduate students, improving their leadership skills. Both PIs are minority members, and they will recruit students to participate in this research from underrepresented groups in physics. In particular the PI will use his position as co-advisor of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)-IUPUI chapter to interest the Hispanic and Native American community in Science careers. Graduate students will be trained in two sub-disciplines in physics, precision measurements and magnetism. Demonstrations associated with the principles of forces, their actions at a distance and the decrease of their strength as the distance increases will be presented at community gathering events (School of Science Freshmen Picnic Day, Open Houses) and recruiting events and in the classroom environment.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal will: i) extend existing constraints for unpolarized masses at submicron range. This will be achieved mainly through a minor modification of the system previously used, ii) develop spin-polarized masses with no net magnetization. This development will be accomplished by the deposition of thin films in the required geometry, (iii) use the grown spin-polarized, zero magnetization films to constrain the existence of monopole-dipole interactions at short ranges, and (iv) study the systematic effect of the residual electrostatic forces present in the experiment. The ubiquitous problem encountered in the measurement of small forces at short separations arising from the effect of random electric potential on the surfaces of the test and source bodies will continue to be investigated."

One approach, called measurement-based quantum computation, requires ""resource states"" in order to work.  Resource states can be made with quantum mechanical systems such as ions, atoms, molecules, superconducting circuits, or elementary quantum states of light called photons. Yet there are still several open questions about how to characterize resource states.  This project will explore how different types of resource states are more or less resilient in the presence of noise. The project will also study how newly discovered phases in solids can be used as a resource states. The outcomes of this research project will promote progress by developing methods to characterize resources for quantum computation, and establishing intellectual connections between materials science and quantum information science. This project will also train students to develop new resources and designs for quantum computers. <br/><br/>Quantum computers boast exponential speedup for certain tasks compared to classical computers. To realize this, designs studied here such as measurement-based models of quantum computation use local measurements on highly entangled states. Entanglement is thus a resource.  However there are still several fundamental questions about this type of resource.  For example, in addition to the cluster state and its generalization, it is not known what other states or other types of entanglement can support universal quantum computation.  It is also important to quantify the extent to which some resource states provide more resistance to noise than others.   This project will address those questions.  It will also investigate if resource states can emerge from certain phases of matter.  For example some states of matter recently found in condensed-matter physics possess topological order, either intrinsic or that protected by symmetry, that may serve as a resource for quantum computing.  More specifically, various symmetry-protected topologically ordered states in one, two, and three spatial dimensions (and intrinsic topological order states in two dimensions) will be studied to see whether they enable quantum computation via construction of new quantum gates, or reduction by local measurement to known types of resource states. Physical properties that enable computation using these states will be characterized. Furthermore, the question of whether these resource states with certain topological properties can lead to new fault-tolerant schemes will be investigated. The outcomes of the project will establish further connections between ideas in quantum information science and condensed-matter physics, and will contribute to the challenge of completely characterizing universal resources for quantum computations. This will contribute to progress designing quantum information processing systems that can be reliably experimental realized."

Observational evidence indicates that our current understanding of elementary particles cannot account for it;  most dark matter is not composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons like the ""normal matter"" whose building blocks we understand well.  Uncovering the nature of dark matter will help us to better understand the contents of the cosmos and how our galaxy and solar system came to be.  An understanding of the identity of dark matter may also help to revolutionize our model of the building blocks of all matter.  Research into the nature of dark matter will thus advance the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental physical science.  The road to understanding the nature of dark matter will involve the synthesis of observations from a wide variety of particle and astrophysics experiments.  In order to derive meaning from observations --- especially when they come in diverse forms --- it is critical to understand the theoretical possibilities for dark matter and their associated phenomenologies.  In her research, Professor Gresham will investigate a compelling class of possibilities for dark matter that are also related to the currently unexplained fact that the vast majority of normal matter is in the form of particles rather than an equal share of both particles and anti-particles.  Professor Gresham's research activities will also have significant broader impacts.  They will enhance undergraduate education through direct involvement of undergraduates in her research and will increase her ability to make exciting contemporary particle astrophysics and cosmology topics accessible to undergraduates.  Professor Gresham will also help to increase the participation of women in physics through her mentoring of undergraduate women and girls in the community.  Finally, she will help to increase science literacy in her rural community by engaging in science outreach to the public schools.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Gresham will investigate the astrophysics and cosmology of dark-matter sectors with a matter/anti-matter asymmetry mirroring the matter/anti-matter asymmetry in the visible matter sector.  A distinctive possibility within such asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models is the clumping or collection of dark matter in other astrophysical objects;  by contrast, symmetric dark matter tends to annihilate (particle with anti-particle) in such circumstances.  Professor Gresham will begin by investigating a class of ADM models in which the formation of bound states of ADM may have rich implications for the formation of structures (e.g., galaxies and stars) in the universe.  Comparison of theoretical models to a diverse set of observations, including possibly observations of gravitational waves, will be necessary."

The usual process of decay is known as beta-decay, where the nucleus emits an energetic electron, thereby turning a neutron into a proton and, at the same time, emitting a ghostly particle called an antineutrino.  This process has been measured and theoretically modeled with excellent agreement.  In rare cases, some nuclei can emit two electrons simultaneously, along with two antineutrinos, in a process called double beta-decay.  This process is difficult to measure, because it is so rare, and difficult to calculate because of uncertainties in the nuclear structure.  The goal of this research is to reduce the uncertainties in nuclear structure by measuring nuclear reactions relevant to the double beta-decay process. This will help in the understanding of experiments on neutrinoless double beta-decay, a proposed beta-decay process in which no neutrinos are observed.  The search for this elusive decay mode has been identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee as one of the most important questions facing nuclear science, since those experiments would provide critical information on the fundamental properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos.<br/><br/>One potential background contribution to experiments of double beta-decay comes from neutrons hitting either the source material or nearby shielding materials.  These neutrons can create more neutrons, or can create gamma rays to mimic the desired signal.  Several current experiments are studying the neutrinoless double-beta decay of isotope xenon-136. A similar isotope, xenon-134, is also present as an impurity, which was recently discovered to emit a potential background event when hit with neutrons. The research conducted with this award will investigate this recently-discovered background using a highly-enriched gaseous xenon target. The gaseous xenon sample will be irradiated with neutrons at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, and then will be counted using a shielded high-purity germanium detector in the Low Background Counting Facility. The research performed under this award will extend our knowledge of potential double beta decay backgrounds in xenon, which will assist in planning the future ton-scale neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Since observation of neutrinoless double beta decay is a major component of the nuclear science long-range plan, gaining information regarding backgrounds is essential."

The overall goal of this project is to develop protocols that will quantify the build-up of quantum correlations and the storage of quantum information in a crystal of trapped ions. The research effort can be placed in the context of quantum simulation: First, theory will guide experiments in regimes where theoretical predictions can be made and used to benchmark experiments. Next, experiments will be done in regimes where the dynamics are inaccessible to current theoretical methods. Finally, these experiments will push the theory and enable the development of new numerical methods capable of reproducing the observed dynamic. These investigations will be foundational to a new generation of synthetic quantum materials, not necessarily limited to trapped ions, with applications ranging from precision sensing and navigation to quantum communication and quantum information science. Moreover, the investigations will train and provide research experience to a graduate student and a postdoc. They will work with the NIST/Boulder experimental ion trap group and the theory groups at JILA and the University of Colorado at Boulder, and thus will be exposed to a highly collaborative atmosphere that will promote advances in quantum information science.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the work is to develop new methods capable of describing the dynamics of quantum correlations and entanglement in trapped ion crystals. These numerical and analytic methods will be used to benchmark and guide the NIST-Boulder experiments where hundreds of cold beryllium ions are confined by a Penning trap in a two-dimensional triangular lattice geometry. In these experiments the spin degree of freedom is encoded in two hyper-fine states of the ions and the collective vibrational modes of the crystal, excited by laser beams, used to generate highly tunable long-range spin-spin interactions. By combining improved numerical techniques with better experimental protocols this team will push trapped ion experiments into a regime where they are able to create highly correlated quantum states and profit from the quantum advantage of these states for enhanced sensing and quantum information processing. These are challenging goals, but the synergy of interests and abilities of the investigators, with expertise spanning quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and theoretical and experimental atomic physics, will allow this group to delve into a broad range of problems motivated by the promise of new quantum technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature?  Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these?  To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions.  One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences.  The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies.  This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND.  Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier.  Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems.  These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC).  A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL.  <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons.  This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics.  Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements.   The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND.  <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."

It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award will provide funding for an astroparticle neutrino program at Drexel University. The goal is to resolve neutrino sources by developing new techniques and analyses to be applied to a new analysis in the southern sky, a hemisphere that has traditionally been a challenge for IceCube because of backgrounds created in the atmosphere reaching the detector without the Earth to act as a shield (as is the case for the northern sky studies).<br/><br/>The IceCube experiment is well suited for making a broader impact given its geographical location and the diverse yet accessible science topics it covers.

She has a long record of commitment to public outreach that will be applied to the many opportunities that Drexel University and the greater Philadelphia region offer.<br/><br/>The group is planning an innovative approach to perform the most sensitive search of Galactic sources to date. It will also perform two new analyses: one focused on measuring the large scale cosmic ray anisotropy in the northern sky using atmospheric neutrinos, and another on testing a high-energy neutrino emission model from the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).

The project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter to study the organization of biological membranes. The modeling efforts will develop new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations. The current understanding of how multi-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) respond to osmotic pressure differentials is incomplete, and experimental observations indicate that a non-linear model coupling membrane dynamics with 3D fluid flow is needed to fully explain the non-linearities of the system. Developing this theoretical framework and providing insight into the underlying physics is crucial for the understanding of how membranes undergo morphological transitions. These models will explain existing experiments and also predict membrane response to different osmotic loads and membrane compositions. Understanding this process is important for better experimental design of in vitro reconstituted systems such as vesicles and also cellular systems. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, using mathematics and physics in biological systems. Both fields will benefit from this approach to studying biological phenomena; the theory will be grounded in experiments and also make predictions to design future experiments. This research will be integrated into the teaching efforts of the PIs in developing new courses at the interface of engineering and biology. The PIs will continue their efforts in enhancing diversity in the UC system while pursuing the research program. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and proteins. A key characteristic of this heterogeneity is the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. This coexistence is thought to be the key organizing principle for the formation of lipid rafts. Studying the formation and organization of the different phases in cellular system is experimentally challenging, given the complex nature of the cells. Giant unilamellar vesicles with controlled compositions, allow us to study lipid behavior in bilayer membranes and gain insight into phase behavior which is important for understanding cellular membranes. Although GUVs are used widely experimentally, our theoretical understanding of lipid phase separation remains rudimentary, since existing models focus on the line tension between preexisting domains and not on domain growth and swell-burst cycles, which are the features observed experimentally. The objectives of this project are to formulate quantitative models of isothermal phase separation and swell-burst cycle in multi-component GUVs and test model predictions experimentally. STUDY 1-DYNAMICS OF SOLUTE EFFLUX. We will use theory, simulations, and experiments to understand the factors that control pore radius, vesicle radius, and the lifetime of the pore. STUDY 2-PHASE SEPARATION IN OSMOTICALLY STRESSED VESICLES. Using a viscoelastic model of multi-component lipid membranes, we will investigate the role of governing energetics in domain growth versus true phase transitions. We will experimentally test the model predictions by tuning the osmotic pressure difference, lipid composition, and sample temperature. STUDY 3-COUPLING BETWEEN DOMAIN FORMATION AND SWELL-BURST CYCLES. In this study, we will develop the mathematical framework to model the complete dynamics of the oscillatory phase separation coupled with the swell-burst cycle observed in the preliminary experiments. This model will combine the dynamics of pore formation outlined in Study 1, with the domain growth model including membrane viscosity in Study 2. The significance of the proposed activities lies in its promise to not only elucidate the fundamental properties of mixtures of lipids reduced dimensional, bilayer configuration but also furnish design principles for designing synthetic protocellular compartments for applications spanning in vitro production of proteins, chemistry in confinement, and delivery of biomedically relevant cargo (e.g., enzymes, drugs, and imaging agents). Using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, this work will be able to provide insight into the complexities of lipid membranes. The long-term impact of the proposed activities stems from the fact that the project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter. The modeling efforts outlined here will result in new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations."

Light-matter interactions at ultra-high intensities are the next frontier of the advanced accelerator research with the potential to enable development of novel accelerators and x-ray sources.  This regime has the potential to disrupt existing paradigms and advance accelerator science at a fundamental level. The prospect of generating copious quantities of energetic photons in laser-target interactions is of particular interest due to its many possible applications, including photo-nuclear spectroscopy, radiation therapy, and radio surgery.  The study is also of fundamental relevance to astrophysics, as it can pave the way to creation of matter and antimatter from light, thus providing valuable insights into the inner workings of the universe. The project will provide essential student training in accelerator science, plasma physics and high performance computing.<br/><br/>The novelty of the regime investigated by this project is that the extreme magnetic field couples three key aspects of laser-plasma interactions at high intensities: relativistic transparency, direct laser acceleration, and synchrotron photon emission. The key questions investigated by the project cover fundamental aspects of electron acceleration in Megatesla-level magnetic fields, including energy scaling with plasma and laser pulse parameters, and the mechanism underpinning generation of such a strong laser-driven magnetic field in a plasma. The project specifically examines the interplay between electron acceleration and photon emission. This interplay is the key feature of this regime, because, while the acceleration enhances the photon emission, the photon emission itself has a strong feedback on the microscopic electron motion. In addition to the synchrotron emission, the project also addresses the role of bremsstrahlung. The bremsstrahlung emission can become relevant due to high plasma density, but the presence of the Megatesla magnetic field can have a profound mitigating effect, suppressing photon emission."

The final result will be a theoretical and experimentally validated approach that can be generalized across many other cancer types. This project develops a new framework to address cancer as a deregulated complex dynamical system and it will lead to an improved understanding of adaptive and acquired drug resistance mechanisms. The project will make a significant contribution toward a major goal of cancer precision medicine, namely the identification of optimal high-order combinations for individual cancer patients. The project will also establish new connections between evolutionary theory and dynamical systems theory. The theoretical and methodological advances will be applicable or adaptable to other cancers and diseases in general, leading to potentially transformative impacts on human health. <br/><br/>This proposal is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division."

High-brightness x-ray light sources are indispensible tools to probe chemical, biological, and physical systems.  The x-ray source is driven by electron beams generated in an accelerator that relies on very intense laser beams to excite waves in a cloud of ionized gas, a plasma, on which electrons can surf to reach high energies. This technology has already shown that electron beams can be produced from devices that are only a few inches long compared to several-football-field-long accelerators using conventional technology.  In order for a lot of x-rays to be generated, the electron beam quality has to be excellent, and this project will demonstrate that such beams can, in fact, be produced. Success of this project will greatly reduce the size of x-ray sources and bring this tool to individual laboratories and investigators, promoting the advancement of science.   This project also supports the education of three graduate students, to be trained in the physics of ultra-short beams, laser-plasma interactions, and advanced accelerator concepts.<br/><br/>The project aims at developing a compact, ultra-fast (femtosecond), soft X-ray radiation source using beams produced by a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA). Intense radiation can be generated via the undulator radiation mechanism by coupling the ultra-short laser-plasma-accelerated electron beam into a conventional magnetic undulator. Transport of the electron beams will be performed with two magnetic lenses, incorporating recently-developed ultra-strong active plasma lenses, and a chicane for energy dispersion. The latter is critical to reduce the beam slice energy spread, enabling the observation of free-electron laser gain. By fielding undulator-based radiation diagnostics, the electron beam quality will be measured on every shot and will provide the necessary feedback to understand and control the requirements imposed on the laser plasma accelerator and transport lattice to deliver high quality beams. The project consists of three phases: (1) Operate the LPA in a stable and high-charge mode with the new 100-TW-class laser system. (2) Implement and demonstrate the LPA source-to-undulator transport system, and commission an undulator embedded with strong focusing. Ultra-short incoherent undulator radiation with on the order of 10^8 photons per shot in the 10-100 eV range is expected. (3) By tuning the chicane, coherent enhancement of the undulator radiation will be pursued. This light source is intrinsically synchronized to the laser driver, making such a compact source ideal for pump-probe applications in ultrafast science."

This research program by Cornell University implements innovative accelerator concepts in pioneering, working accelerator devices. Specifically, this program focuses on two transformational topics: (1) The development of very compact and energy efficient superconducting cavities for particle acceleration, which will enable a new class of powerful, compact accelerators, and (2) dramatic improvements in luminosity of particle colliders via a technique called optical stochastic cooling which promises to significantly improve the quality of particle beams.  Cornell University's work on pioneering accelerator technology paves the way for new accelerators that are ever more powerful probes of materials, biological systems, molecules, atoms, nuclei and the most fundamental particles in nature.  This program will impact accelerators for industry as well. In particular, the technologies that Cornell will develop are essential for the accelerators that are critical tools for medicine, national defense, and perhaps for safe nuclear energy. This research also contributes directly to the education of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge science, engineering and technology, a skillset urgently needed for the U.S. workforce. During summers, students from community colleges will be mentored in research in an environment that would otherwise be unavailable to them. For many it will be a life altering experience.<br/><br/>Superconducting RF (SRF) is the gold-standard for modern accelerators and the most energy efficient means of accelerating a beam of charged particles, but complexity, size, and cost of the current SRF technology until now have limited SRF cavity application to large-scale scientific accelerators. However, recent developments have resulted in drastic reductions of the RF surface resistance of SRF cavities, allowing for a new generation of compact SRF cavities. The SRF research part of this program will focus on the development of such very compact, high-frequency SRF cavities. These will enable completely new SRF-driven accelerators for small-scale university, industrial, national security, and medical applications, by offering robust, compact, energy efficient, and high beam power capable accelerating structures. Optical stochastic cooling promises many orders of magnitude faster cooling rates than conventional stochastic cooling systems that operate in the microwave regime. A cooler beam is more readily focused to high intensity. With cooled hadron beams, proton and heavy ion colliders can achieve significantly higher luminosities; and optical stochastic cooling is presently the only candidate technology for active cooling of electrons, positrons, and muons."

The research to be done will include theoretical studies as well as laboratory demonstrations. The projected results include dramatic simplifications of communication techniques that can come from exploitation of the principle of ""entanglement"", previously not associated with macroscopic light beams. Entanglement refers to the situation in which widely separated particles cannot be described independently of each other (or, mathematically, when the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to demonstrate the utility of entanglement at the non-quantum level. The simple existence of non-quantum entanglement is quickly becoming accepted. Utility will come, for example, from acquiring the ability to use classically entangled macroscopic light beams for communications protocols. This will avoid the strict requirements associated with generation and management and registration of individual photons. In practice, below-threshold diode laser light will provide macroscopically entangled light beams with exactly classical (thermal Gaussian) statistics, and power meters will provide detection capability without individual photon detection. This combination has already been demonstrated in the laboratory. Desirable classical features are the ability to obtain entanglement beyond the two-party level with ordinary lab devices, as well as the existence of stochastic randomness, available in every partially polarized macroscopic light beam. A new theoretical description of three-party additive entanglement inequalities, distinct from tangle-based monogamy, has already emerged from ongoing preliminary work. Two-way beneficial exchanges with the fields of quantum information and quantum optics appear desirable and feasible, for example in implementing protocols for optical multi-mode entanglement swapping at the macroscopic level.Experimental verification will elucidate the potential benefits of this new theory in practical applications."

The ability to use the higher dimensionality of the spatial degree of freedom of quantum states of light in a long-distance quantum network can bring about an analogous revolution to the field of quantum information science by making it possible to transmit large amounts of information through a quantum channel. This CAREER project will study the use of spatial quantum correlations in entangled beams of light to provide more control over the spatial degree of freedom with the goal of making it compatible with long-distance quantum networks. This will enable new possibilities for the use of this degree of freedom in applications that range from long-distance quantum communications to quantum imaging. The research will be integrated with an educational program that seeks to develop the problem-solving skills of the undergraduate students through their active participation in research and the introduction of quantum optics experiments in the undergraduate teaching laboratories. It will also provide educational outreach opportunities for the general public through the involvement of high-school teachers from the NSF RET program in the development of didactical quantum optics demonstrations. Active efforts will be made to involve underrepresented groups, such as Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, in the research and educational programs.<br/><br/>The spatial degree of freedom has been recognized to hold the promise for significant impact in the field of quantum information science due to its large dimensionality. However, this promise has largely been unfulfilled due to the limited capabilities that exist in terms of the control and manipulation of this degree of freedom and its incompatibility with long-distance networks. The goal of this CAREER project is to demonstrate the compatibility of the spatial degree of freedom of quantum states of light with long-distance quantum networks. This will be done through the control of the distribution of the spatial quantum correlations present in continuous-variable (CV) entangled twin beams generated through a four-wave mixing process in a double-lambda configuration in rubidium vapor. The focus on CVs will make it possible to overcome important limitations that result from the probabilistic nature of the more commonly used discrete domain approach. In particular, CVs allow for a deterministic implementation of quantum protocols. This is particularly important for applications, such as quantum repeaters, in which the low yield rate that results from the probabilistic occurrence of events leads to impractical constraints on the apparatus. Among other things, this CAREER project will provide a source capable of generating CV entangled states of light whose distribution of spatial quantum correlations can be engineered. This will enable the use of the spatial degree of freedom in quantum information applications such as secure communications, information processing, and distributed quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The natural response of some transparent materials, in fact, is to convert intense laser light from one color, or frequency, to another, enabling applications ranging from green laser pointers to laser-ignited fusion. Efficient conversion of laser light from one frequency to another requires careful and sometimes complex engineering of the material component in this light-material interaction. These techniques have been very successful for a large range of applications, but are limited by what materials can be engineered for this purpose. Instead of engineering materials in the light-material interaction, the research supported by this CAREER award explores how we can engineer the light. While the main application of this research is the development of new light sources, engineering of light fields could also reveal fundamental physics of the light conversion process, as well as provide an extremely precise tool for performing measurements of the materials themselves. This research will be integrated with education at a research-intensive liberal arts college through mentoring of undergraduates in experimental optical science, as well as the development of curricula for improved scientific literacy through an interdisciplinary first-year seminar course, and providing students early engagement with applications of optics in research through an intermediate-level Optics course. <br/><br/>The main challenge for the efficiency of nonlinear frequency conversion processes such as second harmonic generation is the chromatic dispersion of the nonlinear optical material. Recently, a novel method for correcting the dispersion effects has been developed, in which sequences of counterpropagating pulses are used to interfere periodically with the harmonic generation process, achieving an all-optical version of quasi-phase matching. While experimental demonstrations of this technique have been shown only for high-order harmonic generation, the technique should be applicable to a much wider range of nonlinear processes. In this project, direct experimental testing of current theoretical models will be performed for second harmonic generation, providing a better understanding of the physics involved in the interference. Building on this knowledge and in concert with development of numerical models, the efficiency of phase matching will be optimized using shaping of the ultrafast counterpropagating pulses. The results from these studies are applicable not only to low-order nonlinear optical processes, but also high harmonics, the major source for attosecond science. Additionally, the use of ultrafast counterpropagating pulses will be investigated as a high-resolution, in-situ probe of the dispersion properties of complex nonlinear materials, which may be used in the characterization of periodically-poled media or imaging of biological materials."

The proposed research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. The first real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes are just beginning to occur with experiments like LIGO. To confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO observes the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy.  Mergers of binary systems containing neutron stars may lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, as well as gravitational waves.  This opens the possibility of concurrently observing such events in multiple ways leading to greater understanding of such events.  The simulations will help determine the parameters of such binaries that lead to the strongest electromagnetic and neutrino signals, and the characteristics of these signals (timescale, strength, etc.) that may be important in developing optimal search strategies for detecting these signals. The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand. Relativity and black holes continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. Movies of simulations produced by the investigators will continue to provide public outreach.<br/><br/>To solve Einstein's equations, the investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.  One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes.  A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects, and magnetic fields. The investigators will also develop a new code for computational astrophysics that is designed to take advantage of upcoming exascale machines in a way that current codes cannot.  This new code will be based on discontinuous Galerkin methods and task-based parallelism. It will provide transformative capabilities not only for numerical relativity, but for many problems in computational astrophysics."

The impact on basic research was exemplified by the recent detection of gravitational waves emitted by colliding black holes, which confirmed Einstein's theory of gravity.  At the heart of this achievement is an optical interferometer detector. In general, interferometers have exquisite sensitivity for detecting small disturbances, be they gravitational waves propagating through space or the minute motion of an electron in an atom as explored in this project. The interaction of light and matter is also being exploited in applications that provide more tangible benefits to society, such as non-invasive surgery and future sources of energy. In these cases, the ability to direct large amounts of laser energy into matter in a precise and controllable manner is paramount.  Understanding the physics responsible for precisely sculpting the laser-matter interaction is a major thrust of this project. When a large amount of laser light is coupled into matter, the energy is dissipated by fragmenting the matter, releasing secondary particles such as electrons, ions, and photons. Analyzing the composition of the fragmentation process and the energy flow among the constituents provides a microscopic view of the elementary physics. In this project, sensitive detector configurations are used to allow the measurement of the type of particles, their energy content, and their emission direction, taking into account interference. <br/><br/>This program implements a detailed strategy of utilizing the scaling predicted by semi-classical and quantum models for exploring the global physics of a single atom response to an intense electromagnetic field. The critical scaling parameter is the color, i.e. frequency, of the laser light and the project outlines how novel wavelength lasers can extend the breadth of experiments into an unexplored regime and thus contribute to our overall understanding of nature.  More specifically, atoms and molecules are exposed to intense (atomic unit of field), femtosecond light pulses whose wavelength can be varied from 0.4-4 &#956;m. At these low frequencies, the electronic response, e.g. ionization, is highly nonlinear and the field energy that quivers the electron can exceed the binding energy of the valence electron. In the experiment, the ionized electrons are resolved in angle and energy, and studied as a function of laser intensity, polarization and frequency. The main objectives are to map the global behavior of strong-field ionization, observe how it evolves with scaled field parameters, provide stringent tests of theory and identify the invariant behavior in the physics.  In addition, the laser sources developed by this program have broad applications in science and technology. The interdisciplinary nature of this research coupled with state-of-the-art optical engineering provide an excellent training ground for both undergraduate and graduate students. Former group members are contributing to various areas of science and technology in academia, energy and defense laboratories, and the private sector."

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was further confirmation of this success.  However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory. The precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson at the LHC could provide insight into new physics beyond the Standard Model. This research focuses on exploiting Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to search for new particles, study the decay of Higgs bosons, carry out precision measurements of other Standard Model (SM) processes, use jet substructure to reconstruct high-momentum objects, and extend the capabilities of the CMS particle-tracking detector to increase its acceptance and tolerance to high collision rates. <br/><br/>This research will search for subtle signatures of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics using advanced methods for identifying rare signals and addressing systematic uncertainties.  These include detailed studies of the properties of the Higgs boson, extending the search program for BSM physics, and systematically improving techniques to maximize the physics potential. This research will also extend the capabilities of the CMS tracking detector to handle conditions at the High Luminosity LHC, extend its geometric coverage, and add tracking information to the far-forward particle flow algorithm. In addition, studies will be performed on the properties of highly Lorentz-boosted SM Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs to fully explore the Higgs coupling to quarks, as well as to search for new phenomena in unexplored signatures at higher masses.

Such systems generally cannot be fully described in closed analytical form (mathematical expressions that can be written down) for more than two particles, even if their individual properties and the forces between them are precisely known. This dilemma is well-known as the ""few-body problem"" and it limits the extent to which one can predict the states of the particles (e.g. their positions and velocities) for any time in the future. Therefore, advancing the knowledge of phenomena that emerge due to the complex interplay of several particles requires the joined theoretical and experimental exploration for a wide range of situations. In this project, few-body phenomena of quantum systems consisting of atoms, their electrically charged components (electrons and ions), and photons (the particles of light) will be studied. Such quantum systems represent an ideal testing ground of few-body physics for multiple reasons: First, few-body effects in these systems are ubiquitous and relevant to many research fields and numerous technical applications, particularly in areas such as materials science, quantum chemistry, biological science, and information processing. Second, advanced experimental techniques are available which allow manipulation of the parameters of the few-particle quantum state with a high degree of control and accuracy. Moreover, modern spectrometers enable snapshots to be taken of the state's change over time, allowing details of the state's dynamics to be analyzed. Techniques for the control of atomic few-body systems and for the analysis of their dynamics which have been developed in the past twenty years (largely independently of each other) will be combined in the present project for the first time. This will enable the observation of few-body quantum phenomena while being able to tune the system parameters, and it will allow benchmarking theoretical models.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, this project involves the control and analysis of atomic few-body systems using laser cooling and manipulation techniques to prepare a large variety of initial states, ranging from single excited or polarized lithium atoms to large ensembles of atoms that are cooled to quantum-degeneracy. Systems of only very few atoms can be confined in a micrometer-sized optical dipole trap and their interaction can be tuned close to Feshbach resonances. For the analysis, a ""reaction microscope"" will be employed allowing the coincident measurements of the momentum vectors of atomic fragments after ionization of the lithium atoms by femtosecond or attosecond laser pulses. In essence, there are three fundamental questions to be addressed in the proposed experiments: First, how do the ionization dynamics depend on the relative orientation (or helicity) of an ionizing laser field and a polarized target atom? Such experiments will help to understand fundamental symmetries and ultimately control the interaction of laser fields with chiral (atomic or molecular) targets, which play a crucial role e.g. in biochemistry. Second, how is the disintegration of an atom due to the interaction with an ionizing field influenced by its environment? This is experimentally only studied for clusters or solid targets, but largely unexplored for more dilute systems. Apart from the fundamental importance of this question, the dependence of the ionization dynamics on the environment is relevant to the understanding of the damage of biological tissue due to radiation. Finally, how does the correlated wave function of a few-particle system change as a function of the particle number and interaction type and strength? The possibility to ""engineer"" simple few-body systems and observe such systems comprehensively would allow one to ""simulate"" and understand fundamental quantum phenomena that occur in natural or artificial materials."

Although Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the relevant part of the Standard Model of particle physics, is an established theoretical framework, it is extremely difficult to perform calculations for phenomena that extend over large distances such as the size of the proton. Lattice-QCD, a numerical  first-principles technique that relies heavily on high-performance computational resources, is able to calculate accurately only certain properties of particles such as protons and neutrons. For other properties, researchers rely on physically well-motived phenomenological models. In this broader context, the investigator and his students will develop and apply improved QCD models to study the distribution of constituent quarks and gluons in subatomic particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons. These efforts provide theoretical support to ongoing experimental efforts at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Graduate students involved in this research will be trained in theoretical nuclear physics and will have the opportunity to work on research problems at the forefront of nuclear science, thereby receiving training that prepares them for entering the much-needed workforce in the nuclear science arena. <br/><br/>The Dyson-Schwinger equations approach to nonperturbative model building in QCD preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of QCD, while modeling in the infrared domain is guided by an empirical approach that preserves the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking known to generate at least 98% of the mass of visible stable matter in the universe. This approach is checked against established results of Lattice-QCD and is used to extend and complement Lattice-QCD for domains where lattice results are not presently available. This work will analyze and interpret experimental results about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles and elastic and transition form factors. This project will also develop an improved practical method for solving the QCD bound state equation for excited state mesons and will explore the limitations of a recently proposed approximate approach to parton distributions for Lattice-QCD."

The ability of the MPT to trap various kinds of plasma for laboratory studies will be explored by conducting experiments and computer simulations.  The MPT project at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) is the centerpiece of the UAA Plasma Lab, which supports undergraduate research experience across several STEM fields.

Prior work has shown that radio-frequency (RF) structures of varying multipole order can trap various plasma configurations, consisting of ions only, electrons and ions, or pair and antimatter plasma components. The multipole field is chosen predominantly to interact strongly with light particles but negligibly with heavy ones.  Two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) modeling has shown that the light species experiences a pseudopotential well, with overall space charge neutralized by the heavy species, and the modeling has defined particular multipole and plasma configurations of interest for detailed 3D PIC modeling and first experimental tests of this Multipole Plasma Trap concept.  The behavior of marginally stable particles at the plasma edge and RF sheath, as well as ponderomotive gyroresonance effects, are new topics to be studied.

Although laser filamentation has been studied mainly using near-infrared and visible wavelengths, recent progress in ultrafast laser technology enables the investigation of laser filamentation using longer wavelengths such as mid-infrared and long-wavelength infrared.  In this project, laser filamentation in solids will be experimentally studied by measuring plasma densities directly inside the filaments, with the experiments guided by 3-dimensional computer simulations of laser matter interactions.  The project will impact filament-based technology such as new ultrabroadband and ultrashort light generation for spectroscopy and optical communications."

Metamaterials are artificial materials usually assembled from conventional microscopic materials. Photonic matter in this context is a new state of matter in which photons interact with each other, usually through mutual interactions with ordinary atoms. The metamaterials of photonic matter in this award will be used to advance techniques in particle accelerators.  By taking advantage of highly unusual propagation properties of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in metamaterials, this award will develop both beam-driven (two-beam) and wave-driven accelerators utilizing highly unorthodox propagation geometries that will ultimately lead to developing high frequency switched matrix accelerators capable of overcoming the most severe challenge to high gradient acceleration: the breakdown of the accelerating structures<br/><br/>This research brings together two areas of science: electromagnetics/metamaterials and accelerators. Graduate students will be involved in all stages of this project. Significant outreach effort to high school, undergraduate, and graduate Hispanic students in Texas is planned. High school students from local schools will conduct summer research in the PI's laboratories, collaborate with graduate students, and receive mentorship from the recently established Mentorship Networks among minority students in the San Antonio/Austin area aimed at enhancing the interest and awareness of nanoscale science among minority students. The Mentorship Network has been established through the NSF's Nanotechnology Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) grant to UT-San Antonio/UT-Austin. One of the supported graduate students will have the opportunity to spend considerable time at Argonne National Laboratory and at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) facility testing these novel accelerating structures using short ultra-relativistic beams.<br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this work is the design, fabrication, and experimentally testing accelerating structures that support luminous electromagnetic waves capable of strongly interacting with ultra-relativistic electron beams.  The award will also be used to investigate the possibility of utilizing the recently invented Photonic Topological Insulators (PTIs) based on metamaterials as novel accelerating structures. All accelerating structures will be tested at facilities at Argonne National Laboratory and at SLAC, with particular emphasis on structural breakdown at high accelerating gradients and on techniques needed for short wavelength operation."

When an electron and its antiparticle (the positron) collide, they can convert into two photons, each carrying off the particle rest energy. The universe contains relatively little antimatter, and this asymmetry is currently not understood.  Nevertheless, positrons play an important role in many areas of science and technology, including atomic and plasma physics, astrophysics, materials science, biology and medicine. An important medical application is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) used to image internal organs and measure metabolic activity. In many of these contexts, positron interactions with molecules are significant. This project studies how positrons bind (or ""stick"") to most molecules, albeit for short times, less than about a billionth of a second.  Even though transient, these bound states can have important consequences for medical effects and imaging technologies. This project seeks to understand the nature of positron binding and its potential implications for the fate of positrons in biology and material systems, and also in settings of astrophysical relevance. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator and collaborators have recently developed a new cryogenic, trap-based positron beam with energy resolution of 7 meV FWHM resolution, a factor of 5 better than the previous state of the art. This device will be used to study the interaction of low-energy positrons with molecules with unprecedented precision. Of interest is the excitation of vibrational Feshbach resonances in two-body, positron-molecule collisions; a process in which a positron excites a vibrational mode and becomes trapped on the molecule. While positrons bind to atoms, there are no low-lying excitations to absorb excess energy, and so such resonances cannot occur in two-body collisions in the same manner as for molecules. One objective of the project is to conduct new experiments to gain an understanding of the greatly enhanced molecular annihilation rates as a function of incident positron energy. While a successful theory exists for the excitation of dipole-allowed fundamental resonances, multi-mode effects appear to be important. Their role in annihilation spectra is less well studied to date and less well understood theoretically. The second objective is to make more precise measurements of positron-molecule binding energies. Prediction of these binding energies presents a considerable challenge to theory, particularly in treating accurately electron-positron correlation effects. The new high-resolution beam is expected to provide more precise measurements of binding energies and hence more precise tests of theory."

The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation. Attending research conferences is an important educational experience for students that cannot be replicated at their home institutions. The GEC provides opportunities for students to expand their networks, to learn about cutting edge research, and to develop and hone their professional communication skills.<br/><br/>The GEC is a place to welcome students into a global professional community where they can envision themselves spending their careers. The GEC program is organized with coffee breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon, as a way of facilitating conversation among participants. At the 2018 GEC, intentional steps are being taken to create a more inclusive conference atmosphere for those from groups not well represented at the conference.  These steps include a reconsideration of the GEC experience to add a commitment to diversity and inclusivity to its reputation as a premier venue for gaseous electronics research. Although demographic changes in research communities have slower time constants than might be desirable, the activities enabled by this award have the potential for long term impact by introducing new traditions into the GEC institutional memory. This approach includes introduction of several tested professional development and social events intended to appeal to early career attendees, including students and those from underrepresented groups. Questions added to the post-conference survey will help to assess need for, interest in and effectiveness of the added events, and responses will be used to guide planning for subsequent years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, if event-to-event reproducibility is irregular or involves material damage, irreversible chemical reactions, and/or structural phase transition, single-shot detection is a necessity. The project here is to develop a single-shot camera capable of capturing ultrafast dynamic images, simultaneously recording spatial (2-dimensional) and temporal evolutions in a single-shot. Such a camera can capture images at a frame rate of ~50 trillion frames per second, recording 3 ~ 60 frames in a single-shot. Here, the enabling technologies include ultra-broadband spectrum generation, ultrafast optical pulse shaping, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. This kind of camera can be potentially used in material characterization, biomedical imaging, bio-sensors, and optical and plasma diagnostics. In particular, its application in X-ray free electron lasers will lead to ultrashort electron beam imaging and characterization."

In the process, a new generation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will receive training in disciplines deemed essential for national scientific and economic competitiveness. <br/><br/>The development of compact high-field-gradient laser-plasma accelerators has advanced rapidly in recent years.

Laser light will be used to both inject and accelerate electrons, producing beams with record low emittance. Novel methods will be developed and implemented to measure ultra-low beam emittance. The experimental results will be compared with predictions of modeling and simulation?to either validate existing physical models, or develop new ones that agree with observations.

Particular applications of this research include the development of compact laser generated sources of energetic ion and gamma-ray beams for cancer treatment, high resolution imaging, and detection of nuclear materials for Homeland Security purposes. Another potential major application for this laser system is as a ""table-top"" electron accelerator and x-ray source.

These upgraded amplifiers will replace two existing ""home-built"" pump laser systems which have recently degraded in performance and reliability. The HERCULES laser system has previously achieved the world's highest focused laser intensities, however one of the most exciting frontiers for these lasers is to go beyond this -- to explore the dynamics of plasma in ultra-relativistic fields and observe the effects of radiation reaction and the effects of nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics on laser plasma interactions.

The so-called dusty, or complex, plasma consists of not only ions, electrons, and neutral atoms, but also has large numbers of tiny dust grains that are a few thousandths of a millimeter in diameter. Although small by human standards, these grains are many billions of times heavier than ions. The grains are continuously hit by ions and neutrals and these collisions can cause the grains to move in interesting ways. Because of the grains' size, they are affected by gravity and tend to fall in Earth-based experiments.  The Plasma Krystal-4 (PK-4) experiment on board the International Space Station has the goal of studying the behavior of complex plasmas in zero gravity while subject to the forces from collisions from the ion and neutral flows. The ion and neutral flow patterns have been predicted by theoretical models but have never been actually measured. This Caltech research program will develop a diagnostic to measure these flows. The new diagnostic will be developed for use on a terrestrial replica of the PK-4 experiment located in Germany, and the resulting measurements will be used to predict the ion and neutral flows in the space-borne experiment.  This work is fundamental science in the national interest because it reveals important behavior of the state of matter that occupies much of the visible Universe, but for which very little is now known.<br/><br/>The laser induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic for the flow measurements will be developed using an existing complex plasma experiment at Caltech. The diagnostic will determine the ion and neutral velocities by detuning the laser to compensate for Doppler shifts and will use this to measure previously undetermined ion and neutral flow patterns. The Caltech experiment differs from the PK-4 experiment by having the dust grains consist of spontaneously-formed water ice grains rather than mechanically-introduced fixed-size plasma spheres, but this difference is of no significance for the purpose of LIF development. The LIF diagnostic will take advantage of substantial existing hardware at Caltech, expertise from previous LIF research, and new ultra-narrow-band tunable diode lasers that will provide excellent velocity resolution. Investigation of future microgravity experiments that could be carried out on the International Space Station will also be done. By providing a means for better understanding the underlying dynamics governing the PK-4 experiment, the proposed research is likely to reveal new PK-4 operational modes where there is better control of neutral, ion, or molecular flows or new and interesting regimes. In the course of being developed at Caltech, the LIF diagnostic will address the critical question of how ice grains grow in the Caltech experiment and why this growth saturates; answering this question will have substantial impact on astrophysical models of protoplanetary accretion disks.

This combination of features will enable a host of new developments, including novel atomic clocks based on single-atom control, quantum-enhanced metrology and quantum simulation schemes based on Rydberg interactions, or the bottom-up assembly of Hubbard and orbital-exchange models. Finally, this platform can realistically reach defect-free arrays of hundreds of atoms by implementing scalable atom-by-atom assembly. The aim is to combine large system sizes, precision control over individual particles, and coherent control over interaction mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From the prospect of developing a scalable technology, it is very appealing to work with atoms trapped in solids. Rare-earth atoms in crystals are a very promising system to study because their quantum properties are not significantly degraded by the interaction with the other atoms in the solid. This project will be focused on controlling the quantum states of single neodymium atoms using optical laser pulses and microwave pulses. These studies will determine whether neodymium atoms are well suited for developing quantum technologies, especially quantum communications. This project will allow for training the future generation of scientists and engineers with expertise in quantum science and technology.<br/><br/>Studying and controlling single quantum bits in solids is at the current frontier of quantum information science. To advance this frontier, optical spectroscopy and spin control of single neodymium ions coupled to nano-photonic resonators will be performed, and the prospects for using them as reliable quantum bits will be assessed. The reason for using rare-earth-ions, specifically neodymium, is that they have 4f electronic levels exhibiting some of the best optical and spin quantum coherence in the solid state, similar to trapped atoms and ions.  This study will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between single ions and their nano-scale environment, such as nearby surfaces, hyperfine coupling between nuclei, and ion-ion dipole interaction that have not been studied before at the single quantum level. New optical techniques combining high-frequency-resolution laser spectroscopy, nano-photonics, low temperature, microwave spin control will be developed.

These elementary particles are extremely light and agile--they can move inside atoms, molecules and materials on the timescale of ""attoseconds,"" which is a billionth of a billionth of a second.  To understand the functioning of physical, chemical, and biological processes, it is important to be able to resolve and control the underlying fast electronic motion. Newly devised attosecond techniques provides exactly such an opportunity, using light pulses to strobe the dynamics of electrons.  However, most  initial studies in this field have been conducted on simple systems like atoms and small molecules. The researchers supported by this program will develop and extend attosecond techniques to the study of complex molecules and materials, where one or more electrons are interacting with each other. Success along these directions will open up opportunities for direct investigation of many biochemical and nanomaterial processes relevant for light harvesting and energy storage. The proposed program will therefore advance the state of science by building bridges between the field of physics, and those of chemistry, biology, and material sciences.  The project will also train the next generation of scientists belonging to diverse backgrounds in this emerging and interdisciplinary research field.<br/><br/>Electronic correlation often dominates the excitation and relaxation dynamics of photo-excited molecules and nanomaterials, manifesting itself in the energy and charge redistribution mechanisms in important natural and laboratory processes, such as photosynthesis, repair and damage or DNA, energy storage at molecule-semiconductor interfaces etc. This research project aims at the investigation of correlation-driven physical and chemical phenomena using various types of ultrafast spectroscopy. The high temporal resolution required for these studies will be achieved through the generation of isolated attosecond pulses using double optical gating or similar schemes. The scientific objectives of this program will be to: (1) investigate coherent charge migration dynamics in polyatomic molecules, such as those consisting of a phenyl group, (2) study the coherence in electron wavepacket dynamics and the origin of decoherence mechanisms, and (3) probe the generation and dynamics of high energy excitons in carbon nanomaterials (e.g. graphene). These objectives will be achieved while training graduate and undergraduate students in the field of attosecond physics. Two powerful experimental techniques will be utilized in the proposed measurements: velocity map imaging and attosecond transient absorption. The investigations outlined in the proposal will provide the building blocks for developing a better understanding of the inner-workings of natural and practically relevant phenomena. Collaborations with theorists will play crucial role in the interpretation of results obtained in this unchartered territory, potentially leading to the development of new theoretical models."

Professor Randall's research will contribute significantly to this effort, opening up avenues for dark-matter research that have not yet been explored.  This research program is also highly interdisciplinary, drawing from particle physics, cosmology, and astronomy, with additional potential connections to geology, paleontology, and chemistry.  As such, this research contributes to the national interest by furthering the development of fundamental scientific knowledge within the United States.  This research is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.   It will not only involve students and postdocs, thereby helping them develop a broad skill set, but also serves as a rich backdrop for introducing scientific ideas --- particularly those in particle physics --- to the general public.  The PI's presence in the public sphere also encourages women and other under-represented groups to pursue science, while the PI's recent book ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs:  The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe"" has provided an ideal platform for bringing science to the general public and has led to numerous media appearances.

The PI will investigate these questions within the framework of ""Partially Interacting Dark Matter"", and within one particular realization known as ""Double Disk Dark Matter"", where a small fraction of dark matter particles have interesting interactions beyond the gravitational.   This feature can give rise to new testable signatures that can potentially affect structure formation.    Another generic possibility is ""Flooded Dark Matter"", which provides a natural way to dilute the entropy in the dark sectors.

Increasing the accuracy of these master clocks has in the past enabled such innovations as the GPS systems that we use in our cars and smartphones to locate our position on the globe.  Future improvements in clocks can be expected to enable similar innovations that are only just beginning to be imagined.  The present project seeks to extend the scope of the science and technology we can achieve by keeping track of time ever more accurately, using molecules instead of atoms. Molecules present the possibility of a quantum clock based on different physics than atomic clocks:  nuclear vibrations rather than electronic transitions. Simple molecules that consist of two atoms will be created near the temperature of absolute zero and trapped in standing waves of light to ensure nearly complete isolation from the environment.  These strontium molecules possess very well defined internal energy states that allow precise manipulation and probing with laser light. This clock is sensitive to variations in the electron-to-proton mass ratio that may occur as the universe evolves, and to yet undiscovered forces that might appear at nanometer scales.  <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>A new class of ultracold diatomic molecules based on laser-cooled strontium atoms was recently demonstrated by the primary investigator's research group.  This work (based on optical trapping, manipulation, and imaging of these dimers) will enable precision measurements in molecular physics as well as tests of fundamental laws that may indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model.  Initial work indicates that by applying atomic lattice-clock techniques to this molecule in both the excited and ground states, a direct measurement of the nonadiabatic Coriolis mixing angles of the molecular wavefunctions can be performed; these angles are critical for describing weak molecular bonding near the atomic continuum.  This project will further characterize the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in these weakly bound systems.  Additionally, tightly bound ultracold ground-state strontium dimers will be created for vibrational spectroscopy, or a molecular vibrational clock.  If the mass scaling of the van der Waals type interatomic interaction is better understood, this clock can potentially improve the knowledge of nanometer-scale mass-dependent forces by several orders of magnitude.  When the systematic effects of lattice spectroscopy of this molecule are better characterized and state-insensitive lattice trapping is optimized as part of this project, this molecular clock can set the best model-independent limit on the stability of the electron-to-proton mass ratio.  Robust molecular clocks have applications in geodesy, navigation, and tests of fundamental science. Special efforts are made to involve young public school students from local New York City neighborhoods and expose them to the day-to-day work of scientists."

Gabadadze, M. Porrati, and A. Sirlin at New York University.   <br/><br/>Members of this research group work towards solving fundamental questions in elementary particle physics, cosmology, and gravitation.   The research interests of these faculty members are complementary to one another. To discover new physics it is essential to master the theory that describes all known elementary interactions excluding gravity, namely the so-called Standard Model.  This is the aim of Prof. Sirlin's research.   Quantum gravity and supergravity are the focus of Prof. Porrati's research.  These are the theories most relevant in the study of the universe as a whole, i.e. at very large distances, or for understanding the very early universe.   The study of quantum gravity also connects with attempts to understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy --- mysterious forms of matter and energy which are critical for understanding the way in which the universe evolves.  These problems are investigated by Profs. Porrati and Gabadadze.  Thus, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.    Broader impacts are also expected from the project.  All senior investigators carry out their research in close collaboration with graduate students and postdocs, who are thus trained in advanced theoretical research.   Dissemination of research results will occur through review articles to be published in specialized and popular-science journals as well as through the organization of workshops, video- and Internet-based courses, and  popular lectures.<br/><br/>More specifically, Porrati plans to study topology-changing transition amplitudes in pure AdS3 gravity as well as the torus partition  function and certain indices for pure 3D gravity and supergravity in  various formulations. He also plans to study a generalization of matter couplings in certain supergravity models of inflation  containing higher powers of the scalar curvature. Properties of  high-spin particles in interaction in AdS and Minkowski backgrounds  will be studied by Porrati continuing work done in the last years. Porrati also plans to study holographic renormalization flows of 2D conformal field theories with different left and right central  charges, using a recently discovered new theory of AdS3 massive  gravity called ""minimal massive gravity.""   Gabadadze is proposing research in several different  directions --- on  the cosmological constant problem and modified gravity, on the AdS/CFT  correspondence for massive gravity, on quantum liquids in dwarf stars,  and on solitons in cold atom systems ---  all using the method of effective  quantum field theory as a unifying  theme.  Finally,  in view of the increased precision of a 2013 measurement reported by  the MuCap Collaboration, Sirlin plans to update and improve his 2007 analysis.  In particular, he plans to study the possibility that further  improvement in the experimental precision may lead to an independent,  accurate value for the axial-vector coupling $g_{A}$, a result that may have important implications for neutron beta decay.  Sirlin also plans to study the radiative corrections to antineutrino capture by  protons, a process that is currently  important for reactor studies of neutrino oscillations."

Strong interactions are an ingredient crucial to remarkable phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity. How interactions and disorder compete or cooperate in these materials to affect superconductivity and give rise to new quantum states is not fully understood.  Ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice, which is a crystal formed from light, will be used as a model system to study this critical problem.  Controllable and completely characterized disorder will be introduced by superimposing optical speckle, which is a laser beam consisting of randomly distributed bright and dark regions.  The emergence of different quantum states as the disorder and interactions are independently tuned will be measured. Knowledge gained from this system may lead to a better understanding of high-temperature superconductors and techniques for mitigating the impact of disorder on their performance.  The next generation of engineers and scientists will be trained on cutting-edge technologies in laser science, high-frequency microwave electronics, and high-speed computer-controlled signaling.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous lattice experiments that discovered a disorder-induced bosonic insulator using Rb-87 atoms and observed a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition using K-40 atoms.  Two projects designed to resolve outstanding questions regarding the interplay of strong interactions and disorder in three dimensions will be pursued.  First, the impact of a bath on disorder-localized states will be measured using a mixture of Rb-87 hyperfine components trapped in a spin-dependent lattice.  Second, the influence of long-range interactions on quantum localization will be investigated using Rydberg dressing of K-40 atoms trapped in a disordered optical lattice.

Such atom-photon interactions constitute one of the most basic processes in physical science, and underlie many everyday phenomena as well as many device applications in areas such as optoelectronics. Most of these processes and devices involve large numbers of atoms and intense beams of light, since the interaction between single atoms and single photons are typically negligibly weak. The interaction can be made substantial if one builds a system in which an atom interacts with light confined in a very small space. Such strong atom-photon interactions lead to many new phenomena that not only deepen our understanding of nature, but may also form the basis of future technologies. These include novel transistors based on individual photons interacting with each other, novel states of matter in which atoms and photons are intertwined with one another, and robust quantum information systems that enable advances such as secure communication over long distances and ultra-precise quantum sensors.

The principal investigators will also continue to develop new and efficient ways for disseminating physics knowledge through teaching, collaborations, review articles, lecture notes, organization of workshops and summer schools.

However, design of combinatorial regimens cannot be done by empirical trial and error in the clinical setting. The goal of the project is to blend a systems biology network-based theoretical framework with an integrated experimental and analytical program in order to address the combinatorial regimen challenge in oncology. Based on areas of exemplary clinical need, investigator expertise, and the availability of patient-derived tumor tissue, the project will focus on BRAF-mutant melanoma and PIK3CA-mutant, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer as initial tumor types in which to pilot the approach. In addition the project will offer interdisciplinary training and research experience to postdoctoral and clinical fellows, graduate students, and indirectly to all members of the groups who participate.

Plasmas are also common in technologies such as gas discharge lamps, microfabrication processes, fusion plasmas, combustion engines, and Hall thrusters. This project will develop new methods based on atomic spectroscopy to monitor the electric and magnetic fields inside of laser-generated laboratory plasmas. This is important because plasma fields are notoriously difficult to monitor, especially for small volumes of plasma, without influencing the particle distributions and fields. The research will pioneer novel quantum technologies that provide non-invasive plasma diagnostics. Shock fronts and ordered structures in plasmas will be studied, as well as the effects of magnetic fields on plasma dynamics. Due to the importance of plasmas in technology, plasma-physics research such as this drives advances in economic competitiveness and prosperity, national defense, space exploration, and communications. It also promotes progress in basic plasma science and astrophysics. Students affiliated with this project will get training that will help them prepare for careers in science, industry and education. <br/><br/>This study is on small-scale, magnetized, and potentially strongly-coupled, plasmas obtained by laser-induced photo-ionization of atomic vapors.  Both trapped atoms and room-temperature alkali-atom vapor cells will be used. As the photo-generated plasmas expand, they form shock fronts, and in the case of sufficiently strong coupling between ions and electrons the plasmas are expected to develop correlations with crystal-like order.  This project will pioneer novel ways to make position- and time-resolved measurements of the expansion, the shock fronts, and the ordered structures in plasmas. A diagnostic method will be developed using laser spectroscopy with Rydberg atoms and electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT).  Electric fields in the plasma will be mapped via Rydberg-EIT spectroscopy.  Another diagnostic will use micro-channel plates to count particles that are extracted from the plasma after a variable delay.  The use of field-sensitive Rydberg-state tracer atoms embedded in the plasma as an all-optical diagnostic of macroscopic and random (Holtsmark) electric fields in plasmas may impact other fields in which magnetized plasmas occur, for instance in astrophysics, inertial-confinement and magnetic-confinement fusion, z-pinch studies, and ion trapping.

This science can contribute to the economy and to public well-being because development of these laser-based reagents could one day allow chemical synthesis of novel materials and medicines.  Progress toward this goal is challenging, however, because molecules are so complicated and dynamic that it is difficult to determine the correct laser characteristics to drive a particular process.  This project will use experimental feedback to guide an adaptive search of the possible laser pulses.  This type of method is proven to work, but it is only as good as the feedback that drives it.  The goal of these studies is to develop and exploit enhanced image-based feedback techniques that refine this approach to controlling chemical dynamics.  Doing this work with undergraduate students also provides students with motivation for further scientific education and therefore helps develop a highly skilled workforce.    <br/><br/>Interactions between strong laser fields and polyatomic molecules are at the forefront of many aspects of ultrafast science.  Shaped ultrafast laser pulses can powerfully influence molecular dynamics, thus allowing access to outcomes not typically available by other means.  The area of emphasis of this research program is adaptive femtosecond control, in which a learning algorithm is used to guide the construction of shaped ultrafast laser pulses that produce a desired result.  In order for the adaptive search to succeed, robust, well-defined feedback is required.  To this end, this team developed the capacity to use three-dimensional momentum imaging of the laser-molecule reaction products. By applying rapid three-dimensional image-based feedback to the control of photoisomerization in small hydrocarbon molecules, this team is able to examine how manipulating the electronic excitation of the molecule influences the nuclear motion, and thus affects ultrafast chemical processes.  Understanding basic strong-field processes helps to guide these coherent control protocols by allowing this team to link image-based feedback to specific target states.   This team will pursue several experiments that can advance the understanding of how strong-field ionization occurs in polyatomic systems, including the role that field-dressed orbitals with strong Rydberg character have on tunneling ionization in polyatomic molecules."

The understanding and use of polarized light is central to both the science of light and to applications ranging from medicine to consumer electronics. For example, some of the triumphs of the computer information revolution have been built around manufacturing technologies that require almost unimaginable precision in measurements--many of which are light-based and use the polarization of light in ways that can be precisely controlled and measured. The proposed research uses the concept of an ""unconventional polarization state"" - a special form of light in which the polarization varies across the width of a laser beam - to explore fundamentally new ways of carrying out light-based measurements.  In conjunction with some special optical devices, it is possible to use an ordinary camera to create a visual map of the polarization in a single image, something that ordinarily requires a sequence of four or more images and accompanying algorithms. These measurement methods will also spur new ways of thinking about how to execute the simultaneous measurement of sub-nanometer process errors in microelectronics manufacturing.<br/><br/>The multiple measurements required to characterize the polarization of an ultrafast laser pulse or individual photon require either a time-sequential operation or explicit division of the amplitude into different detector ports. While each of these has been used to good success, there is a need to truly extend polarization measurements in a way that the maximum amount of polarization information is extracted from each measured photon (in the case of low light levels) or each pulse (in the case of ultrafast pulse characterization).  Because the method is extendable to the mapping of polarization over a sampled image field, it is possible to extend the concept to capture either angle- or frequency-resolved polarization information in a single image. The investigation also applies the new physics of unconventional polarization states to the now-famous physics of weak measurements by using unconventionally polarized light to measure two or more physical quantities in a single measurement. This concept will be tested by measuring nanoscale features in a microscope equipped with a liquid crystal controller that defines a field with arbitrary polarization, amplitude, and phase for focused beam scatterometry. The work is expected to impact allied areas of physics (through the introduction of new measurement methods), optical engineering (specifically, polarization engineering and image formation), biomedical optics (in medical imaging and spectroscopy), environmental science (through the use of polarimetric light scattering for aerosol characterization), and semiconductor inspection."

For example, when two conductive plates or surfaces are brought together they either repel or attract each other depending on whether they have the same or opposite electric charges.  If they are uncharged, there is no electrical force between them.  However, this classical picture breaks down when the surfaces are brought very close together with a gap of a few nanometers.  At that small distance the electric field between the surfaces exhibits quantum effects and there is a small but measureable force between them.  This is called the Casimir effect, named after the scientist who explained how the quantized electromagnetic field results in a force between uncharged surfaces.  Understanding various types of Casimir forces is important for our fundamental knowledge of quantum physics and for applications to materials used in micro- and nano-technologies.  This project will study a phenomenon referred to as the Casimir torque in which the two surfaces are caused to rotate.  The research team will demonstrate and quantify how materials with different optical properties experience the Casimir torque.  <br/> <br/>Despite the pervasive nature of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and their influence on nanoscale science and engineering, control of fluctuation-induced phenomena is difficult. Here it is proposed to test several hypotheses and predictions related to the Casimir torque, which will lead to the generation of new knowledge about controlling these interactions. The first test will be of the hypothesis that the measured torque can be strengthened by increasing the optical anisotropy of the two materials. The second test will be of the hypothesis that the direction of rotation depends on whether the optical axis of a birefringent material has an index of refraction that is higher or lower than that of its extraordinary axis. The third will be to explore the idea of using the Casimir force to translate lateral motion into rotational motion. These experiments will not only advance the science related to quantum phenomena but will also lead to new experimental techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of the interaction of these photons with the electrons inside atoms led to development of devices such as lasers, atomic clocks, supersensitive miniature magnetometers, etc. The goal of the present project is to extend these studies to photons of much shorter wavelengths: 10,000 to 100,000 times shorter. These photons, invisible to the naked eye, begin to enter the regime where they are known as ""gamma-photons"" or ""gamma-rays."" Rather than interacting with the electrons inside atoms, these high energy photons interact with the nucleus of the atom. Some of the reasons gamma-photons might be better than conventional (optical) photons for applications is that they can be detected more easily, they can be focused to much smaller spots (ultimately limited by the wavelength of the photon), and they can in principle help process information more quickly because of their higher frequencies.  A problem is that they are currently very difficult and expensive to produce and hard to control precisely because conventional optical lenses and mirrors do not work at such short wavelengths.  This work seeks to advance the development of compact (""table-top"") sources of highly controlled gamma-photons, both through experiments and theoretical work.  In effect, this work seeks to extend the field of ""quantum optics"" to wavelengths approaching the gamma-ray regime.  If successful, the work may find applications in the areas of quantum information science, spectroscopy, microscopy, metrology, and sensors. The proposed joint theoretical and experimental research program will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging field of the experimental and theoretical quantum gamma-optics as well as in the related (and more general) experimental techniques, analytical methods, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the experimental and theoretical development of methods to coherently control the interaction of gamma-photons with nuclear ensembles via the variation of the resonant frequency of the nuclear transition in the laboratory reference frame.  This variation is achieved via the Doppler shift associated with precisely vibrating the solid through which the photon passes.  This is used in conjunction with a source of heralded single photons provided by the essentially simultaneous emission of two photons at 122 keV and 14.4 keV via the natural radioactive decay of Cobalt-57.  The advantages of nuclear transitions over electronic transitions is that they have narrow, lifetime-broadened spectral linewidths in bulk solids at room temperature (due to the large mass and small size of nucleons, shielding from the environment, and recoilless absorption due to the Mossbauer effect). This results in orders-of-magnitude stronger interaction of the photons with the nuclear ensemble. Progress has been limited, however, by the absence of bright coherent sources and high finesse resonators in the desired short wavelength range.  The present work is based on the lead scientist's recent realization of a table-top source of ultra-short photon sources in the 14.4 keV range with coherent properties, as well as the demonstration of efficient control of single gamma-photon waveforms (F. Vagizov et al., Nature, vol. 508| 3 April 2014, p. 80). The technical and fundamental limitations of the technique as presently developed will be explored and new techniques for the production of short intense pulses and single gamma-photon shaping will be developed.  Applications for the controlled single-photon waveforms will be explored in the areas of quantum information science."

First, experiments on these ultracold atomic gases will unravel central mysteries in materials science, specifically those pertaining to materials with strongly correlated electrons and frustrated magnetic interactions, both of which lead to novel phases of matter. These novel phases may enable advances in information storage, information processing, or high-temperature superconductivity. Second, this project advances capabilities in preparing and controlling complex quantum systems. These capabilities are expected to fuel the development of new quantum technologies.

In both lattice structures, strongly bonded multi-site plaquettes are coupled weakly to one another. In the limit of zero coupling between plaquettes, the lattices are composed of many fully isolated, few-site, few-particle quantum systems.

Spectroscopy is important because the colors of light (or ""spectrum"") absorbed by atoms is a unique fingerprint that is useful for chemical identification in a broad range of applications found in medicine, defense, and industry. Spectroscopy can also reveal details about sub-atomic particles and their fundamental interactions.  Ps is a unique atom for this purpose.  Ps is formed by an electron bound with an anti-electron (positron).  Because Ps does not contain any protons or neutrons, spectroscopy of Ps atoms is an excellent test of bound-state quantum electrodynamics, a cornerstone theory for modern atomic physics.  This project will thus promote the progress of science.  This project will also help expand the nation's high technology work force by training students from diverse backgrounds to develop and implement high precision spectroscopy techniques.<br/><br/>The purely leptonic positronium (Ps) atom is uniquely well-suited for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED).  High accuracy Ps spectroscopy at the few parts per trillion level will provide background information that can be used to extract non-QED physics out of precision atomic measurements with heavier leptons and hadrons.  In this way, Ps spectroscopy can shed light on the proton charge radius puzzle.  It can also help constrain higher level recoil effect corrections in muonium. The previous precision measurement of the Ps 1S-2S interval, 1,233,607,216.4 +/- 3.2 MHz, performed by the coPI and S. Chu has stood for 25 years.  The uncertainty in this measurement came from positronium atoms spending too little time in the laser beam (transit time broadening), atoms moving too fast (second-order Doppler shift), laser intensity too high (AC Stark shift), and metrology limited at the ~1 MHz level.  This project will implement several new techniques to improve accuracy and precision. A position-sensitive time-of-flight detector will record the trajectory and speed of every detected atom as it passes through a larger laser beam profile, and thereby reduce the uncertainty due to second-order Doppler shifts, AC Stark Shifts, and transit-time broadening. A frequency-comb and a frequency-beat technique will be used to monitor the instantaneous laser frequency as positronium atoms transit the excitation beam.  These innovations should reduce the uncertainty in the measurement by a factor of 300, with the goal of reaching a 10 kHz uncertainty.  This work will train graduate students in a combination of atomic physics, positron science, laser spectroscopy, and metrology. This training will benefit the students as well as the Nation by providing highly skilled Ph.D.'s for the scientific workforce.

In cosmology, it is conjectured that the large scale structure of the universe is a vestige of defects (e.g. ""cosmic strings"") formed as the Universe cooled through a phase transition (via the so-called ""Higgs mechanism"") shortly after the Big Bang.

The experiments will use ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (a quantum state of matter that forms at extremely low temperatures) to explore phase transitions in which the behavior of the transition is determined by quantum effects rather than thermal effects.  In addition to providing new insight to the fundamental quantum science of many-particle systems, these experiments have potential applications to quantum information science and to the development of new quantum sensors for inertial guidance and measurement of gravity and magnetic fields. <br/><br/>This experimental research will study strongly interacting ensembles of spin-1 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate to explore the nature of quantum phase transitions in the neighborhood of the critical point and to investigate creation, control and characterization of non-classical highly entangled states of the ensembles. The investigations use small rubidium-87 atomic Bose-Einstein condensates containing just a single spin domain, such that the dynamic evolution occurs only in the internal spin degrees of freedom. These condensates feature a well-characterized Hamiltonian with a tunable quantum phase transition that allow exploration of both ferromagnetic and polar (nematic) ground states of the spins.

A common theme in all of these studies is the role of finite size effects that manifest in the quantum fluctuations of the system.  This research will provide insight into fundamental principles of many-particle quantum mechanics that are important to many areas of physics and will point the way to future explorations of quantum many-body spin systems including thermalization and ergodicity crossing a quantum phase transition, investigations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos and other non-linear phenomena, and finite temperature effects."

There are too many features that the model does not explain, including the origin of dark matter, why neutrino masses are so light, how the matter-antimatter asymmetry arose, and why Charge-Parity-violation only appears when weak forces are concerned.  These are the questions that motivate the Rare Event Search Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This award provides support for two beyond-Standard-Model searches: the axion search ABRACADABRA, and the neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) search KamLAND-Zen and related R&D project NuDot.  ABRACADABRA will undertake a search for axions, which are one of the particles postulated to form dark matter.  A demonstration of neutrinoless double-beta decay would address the questions of why neutrino masses are so light and what produces the matter-anti-matter asymmetry in the universe.<br/><br/>The program will deliver several beneficial aspects to society through its integration of undergraduates into the program. The multidisciplinary aspects of the projects are appealing to students across a range of majors, exposing students to particle and nuclear physics when they might otherwise have missed the opportunity. The NuDOT and ABRACADABRA detectors are being developed in close association with scientists at local companies. This exposes the undergraduates in the group to alternative career paths as well as promoting strong ties between academia and industry<br/><br/>KamLAND-Zen will be the first ton-scale NLDBD experiment. NuDot, which is a potential upgrade path, can open the door to even large scales. On the other hand, ABRACADABRA is leading the way in a new wave of ""table top"" beyond-Standard-Model experiments. This is a largely unknown experiment, because it is about to bring out first results. ABRACADABRA brings discovery-level particle physics back to the university. The high intellectual merit of the proposed studies is demonstrated by the excellent alignment of the physics questions with the ""science drivers"" identified by the Particle Physics Program Prioritization Panel (P5). This proposal addresses: 1) the pursuit of the physics associated with neutrino mass; 2) the identification of the new physics of dark matter; and 3) the exploration of the unknown for new particles, interactions and physical principles. This work is similarly well-aligned with the Long Range Plan of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC), which made the call to move quickly on NLDBD experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current astronomical observations indicate that many elements found commonly on Earth were first synthesized in the center of stars, where fusion and other nuclear reactions take place. These nuclear reactions control the associated energy generation and evolution of stars. However, the stellar conditions are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Under the special conditions proposed here, using a novel compact accelerator placed deep underground, some of the key nuclear reactions that take place in stars can be measured. The goal of this research is to measure nuclear processes that are part of a chain of reactions leading to the synthesis of elements.  These are the elements that make possible life on Earth.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to study the strength of stellar neutron sources that drive the s-process, one of the two dominant sources for the production of heavy elements. One of the most critical processes is alpha-particle induced reactions on Ne-22, producing Mg-25 plus a neutron, but other alpha-neutron reactions may also play a role depending on the stellar environment. However, the large cosmic ray induced neutron background has been prohibitive for advancing these measurements into the stellar energy range and the present reaction rates rely on theoretical extrapolations that carry high uncertainties. There has been no facility where these measurements can be pursued in a background neutron free environment. Over the past years the CASPAR (Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical Research) instrumentation has been constructed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility to address this need. CASPAR operates a 1 million-Volt, high intensity, fully refurbished Van de Graaff accelerator that can provide alpha beam intensities of several hundred micro-Ampere. The proposed experiments rely on the use of a solid and a recirculating gas target system and a He-3 detector system for neutron counting. Successful implementation of a science program at CASPAR will offer a competitive opportunity for the US nuclear astrophysics community to maintain leadership in the field. It will provide a world-wide unique opportunity to study stellar helium burning reactions associated with the synthesis of carbon and the neutron production for trans-iron nuclei."

Neutron decay is a useful laboratory for studying details of the force responsible - the weak nuclear force - one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This award will support an experiment in which beams of free neutrons pass through specialized detectors that precisely measure the neutron decay lifetime and the angles between the emitted particles. From these results the scientists can test and refine the theory of the weak nuclear force and better understand the physics of the sun, stars, the Big Bang, and important nuclear reactions. This work, at the ""precision frontier"" of particle and nuclear physics, complements research at the ""high energy frontier"", for example at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. This project is also an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in the general methods and theory of neutron science that are applicable to diverse fields in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology research at major neutron sources around the world.<br/><br/>The beta decay of the free neutron is the prototype semileptonic weak interaction and simplest nuclear beta decay. There are no complications from nuclear structure, and the decay energy is small compared to the nucleon mass so recoil-order weak form factors enter below the 0.1% level. Therefore neutron decay is an attractive system for precise low energy weak interaction measurements. The neutron lifetime establishes the time scale and temperature of nucleon ""freeze out"" shortly after the Big Bang, which sets the neutron to proton ratio during the era of primordial nucleosynthesis and hence the helium abundance, and indirectly constrains the effective number of light neutrinos. The electron-antineutrino correlation ""a"" gives lambda, the ratio of axial vector (GA) and vector (GV) weak nucleon couplings. With the neutron lifetime it can be used to determine Vud, the first element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model such as weak scalar and tensor forces. The present experimental situations with both the neutron lifetime and lambda are unsatisfactory, there is relatively poor agreement among previous measurements. The proposed program consists of three projects: 1) A continuation of the aCORN experiment at the NIST Center for Neutron Research toward an ultimate goal of measuring ""a""  to < 0.5% uncertainty (a factor of 10 improvement); 2) a phased program to improve the neutron lifetime measurement using the beam method; and 3) development of a 3He gas scintillation absolute neutron flux counter to support the neutron lifetime program."

The dramatic detection of the first few signals in late 2015 also opened our ears to the existence of black holes with up to about 36 times the mass of our sun, in binary orbits close enough to merge with a huge release of energy in the form of gravitational waves. However, this has only scratched the surface of what gravitational-wave signals may be out there and what we can learn from them. The research supported by this award will take full advantage of the new capabilities as the Advanced LIGO detectors improve and are joined by similar facilities in Italy, Japan and eventually India. The goal is to enhance communication and cooperation with the broader astronomy community so that the astronomical community can use all the modern tools of astronomy, from optical and radio telescopes on the ground to X-ray and gamma-ray detectors on spacecraft, to find and study the sources of LIGO's gravitational-wave signals through the electromagnetic energy and/or neutrinos that they may also emit. Specifically, this effort will help to improve the analysis software and procedures to select promising events more rapidly and reliably, with better monitoring, and to produce prompt public alerts for strong, clear events. This group will collaborate on searches for gamma-ray, X-ray and radio bursts matching up with gravitational-wave events, as well as explore how best to use the growing network of gravitational-wave detectors to search for ""scalar"" gravitational-wave bursts, which would be a distinctive sign that Einstein's theory is not the whole story about gravity. Finally, the PI will share his expertise and develop fun and educational hands-on activities for children and their parents to learn about science through a Family Discovery Days outreach program. <br/><br/>The LIGO-Virgo ""EM follow-up program"" has enlisted over 90 partner groups who have shown a strong response to the gravitational-wave events and candidates shared with them so far, but several technical aspects of the program need improvement. Building on this group's experience with the current event selection and alert generation software and procedures, the PI will help re-implement the system to be faster, more robust, easier to monitor, and ready to generate both public and private alerts during the future observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network. This group is currently discussing with LIGO and Virgo collaborators how best to manage the system design, software development and testing which will be needed. In parallel, they are working with the Fermi mission science team and LWA radio observatory users to search for gamma-ray bursts and radio transients that may be the counterparts of gravitational-wave signals, in both triggered and un-triggered search modes. According to various models, binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are likely to produce emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum, although they may be challenging to detect and to definitively identify as the counterpart. It remains an open question whether binary black hole mergers, like the events detected by LIGO so far, produce detectable emissions. To test whether general relativity (GR) is the correct theory of gravity, the PI will use a modified version of the WaveBurst algorithm to search for gravitational-wave bursts with a scalar strain polarization, distinct from the tensor polarization states which are the hallmark of GR. The group will investigate both all-sky and position-constrained (when a possible counterpart has been identified) searches; the latter can also enable a test of whether the waves travel at the speed of light (as predicted by GR) or not."

In these processes, the membrane curving protein caveolin 1 (cav1) and the different types of nano-scale domains it forms at the PM are emerging as critical mechano-transducing hubs and tension buffering structures of mammalian cells. Yet, the structural plasticity of cav1 nano-scale domains and their functional coupling to the local mechanical and tension states of the PM are still enigmatic. Consequently, some of the fundamental mechanisms by which the cell membrane adapts to varying forces at the nano-scale remain undefined. This project aims at understanding how cav1 nano-scale domains modulate the PM structure in response to mechanical cues and at defining the core physical principles that govern PM plasticity, maintenance of membrane tension and proper cell response to forces. <br/><br/>This project will be implemented through a multidisciplinary approach that integrates super-resolution (SR) microscopy imaging, optical force sensing, engineering of bio-materials for cell mechano-biology, quantitative biophysics and modeling. It will (i) define, quantitatively, the nano-scale organization of cav1 nano-scale domains at the cell PM, (ii) establish their plasticity in response to specific PM forces, (iii) determine how they locally regulate PM tension and (iv) provide physical models of their functions as key PM tension modulators. By its original and multidisciplinary nature, the project engages its participants in highly interdisciplinary research. It will provide them with skills that match the current convergence between cell biology, physics and engineering research. The proposed activities also provide a platform integrating modern technology and cross-pollination science for traditionally underrepresented students at the undergraduate and high school levels, through (i) hands-on experimentation with imaging probes, cell culture and microscopy imaging, (ii) outreach projects and (iii) educational activities. Economically disadvantaged undergraduate and high school students will be recruited via established programs at USC and through outreach to high schools in the Greater Los Angeles Area. In particular, an 8-weeks Summer Internship organized by the PI and Co-PI together with the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program at USC will be offered to high-school students over the course of the project. Experience and knowledge gained by actively taking part in the project will attract this younger generation of scholars to the field of Biophysics and will provide them with strong scientific foundations<br/><br/>The functional influence of cellular adhesion forces on the 3D plasticity of cav1 nano-domains and their spatial coupling to sub-membranous actin fibers and focal adhesions (FAs) will first be established by correlative 3D SR microscopy, robust spatial correlation analyses and modulation of adhesion geometry for micro-patterned cells. This will provide new understanding of the homeostatic PM functions of cav1 nano-domains as cells respond to specific mechanical constraints. The plasticity of cav1 nano-domains will then be quantitatively correlated with extra- and intracellular picoNewton forces developed along the PM at FAs by combining optical force sensor measurements, SR microscopy and cell micropatterning. This will shed new light on the role of cav1 as a mechano-transducer of extra/intracellular forces at the cell surface. Using quantum dot tracking of curvature- and non-curvature-coupled PM receptors together with 3D SR microscopy of cav1 nano-domains in live cells, the functional roles of cav1 nano-domains as local modulators of PM tension will then be established. This will reveal how they participate in adaptive coupling between local PM tension and cellular force generation on substrates. Finally, physical models describing the plasticity of cav1 nano-domains as a function of local membrane tension will be conceived and tested quantitatively to define some of the core physical principles that govern the adaptation of the cell PM to forces. Beyond offering new optical tools and original methodologies to study the function of PM nano-structures in cells, this work will bring novel insights into the physics of living systems by providing a mechanistic understanding of the physical principles that dictate PM plasticity and adaptation to forces at the nano-scale.

The team will construct mathematical models that will elucidate the laws describing microbial growth, and the interplay between size regulation, cell cycle progression and protein production. Moreover, the implications of single-cell variability on the growth of the population as a whole will be studied. Model predictions will be used to design new experiments and will be tested by collaborators. Building on the PI's rich experience in outreach for more than a decade, the PI proposes to develop three important educational programs, each aimed at a different target audience. First, the PI will continue and extend his support to the ""Teach"" initiative, developing new content for a program which exposes the ethnically diverse K-12 community in Cambridge to STEM content, and in particular the physics of living systems. Within this project, the PI and his group will interact directly with hundreds of seventh graders from the Cambridge public system, exposing them to academic life and to modern science. Second, the PI will collaboration with Harvard's Museum of Natural History, and will take a role in a new exhibit on ""Microbial Life: A Universe at the Edge of Sight"", where he will present to K-12 teachers. Third, the PI will develop a mentoring program for the Physics Olympiad for high school students in the Boston area, putting special emphasis on female students and students from underrepresented groups. Together, these projects will expose a large number of students and teachers to exciting topics which are not covered in their school curriculum, and will aim at attracting the students into science and research.<br/><br/>The project deals with mathematical modeling of the cell cycle in microbes, focusing on the regulation and coupling of DNA replication, cell division and protein production. These are fundamental processes common to all life forms. One of the proposed approaches is to use Langevin-type equations to produce coarse-grained descriptions of the cell cycle. Such phenomenological models have proven to be extremely useful in the study of cell physiology, and can provide us with important insights into the biological processes. The existence of strong feedback in biological systems, in addition to various sources of stochasticity, leads to significant theoretical challenges, which will be addressed and developed within this proposal. Similarly, the study of population growth involves dealing with subtle correlations between cells in a lineage tree, which is a long-standing, mathematically challenging problem. To these technical difficulties is added to one of a more profound nature: choosing the ""correct"" minimal model that can capture the essence of the phenomena and yet have predictive power. Deepening our fundamental understanding of the cell cycle will have direct manifestations on a broad spectrum of problems. Developing novel antibiotics will be aided by an improved understanding of the bacterial cell cycle, as well as the proposed study of the effects of single-cell variability on the population growth. In particular, the growth and cell cycle of mycobacteria is an underexplored and poorly understood problem, its advance having significant impact on treatment of M. tuberculosis. Similarly, studying the cell cycle in single-celled microbes will allow us to resolve it at the single-cell level, without the added complication of cell-cell signaling, which will provide us with important insights that might be generalized to growth regulation in mammalian tissues, and its failure during cancer growth.

Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself.

The Co-PIs have established each technology separately as research instruments in their laboratories; this will be the first time that a microscope with all of the described capabilities will be made available for research.

Conventional microscopy requiring sectioning (confocal or multiphoton) is too slow to capture a large number of kinetic events: bacterial swimming, heartbeats, blood flow, intracellular organelle movement, and many more. The limitations of conventional imaging modalities could be mitigated if one could record the spatial information of an extended sample volume in a single camera snapshot. Such synchronous volumetric imaging capability not only removes the delicate focusing requirement of conventional microscopy, but also dramatically enhances the imaging throughput.  In this project, the PI will tailor the instrument to in situ environmental microbiology of remote or extreme environments. Micron-scale organisms remain a neglected size scale for which limited in situ imaging has been performed.

It elaborates on previously initiated techniques to study gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions and their extension to the realistic case of four dimensions. New calculational techniques, developed by Professors Kabat, Nair and others, will be used to explore the effects of spin and novel boundary conditions on the Casimir force. Various aspects of field theory on ""fuzzy"" (noncommutative) spaces will be explored using recently developed techniques, the eventual goal being an effective action which captures nonperturbative effects in the large-N (continuum) limit.  Finally the AdS/CFT (Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory) correspondence will be used as a precise formulation of quantum gravity to investigate how local bulk physics emerges from the CFT.  Previous work by Kabat and collaborators, relying on 1/N perturbation theory to represent local bulk observables in the CFT, will be extended to higher orders in 1/N and used to constrain CFT four-point functions.  The entanglement structure of the CFT will be used to study the black hole interior, and the failure of bulk locality at finite N for black holes and cosmology will be investigated."

The PI will study novel few-body states and search for new exact results for the many-body systems. Most results will be very quantitative and free from uncontrolled approximations. There are a number of topics which will be studied, including three- and five-body Efimov states, states where the atom is constrained in one or more dimensions, for example near a surface,  and atomic or molecular states near a Feshbach resonance. In addition, the PI will derive exact relations for strongly interacting Fermi gases and density profiles for quantum gases near a wall.<br/><br/>With the advance of technology, mankind can now actively manipulate the microscopic world. It is particularly useful to cool atoms and molecules to temperatures that are billions of times closer to absolute zero than the background of the universe. High precision atomic clocks, for example, are only possible with sufficiently cold atoms. In order to study these systems, one must solve the Schrdinger equation, which is challenging even for just a few atoms. In many cases, the lack of an adequate solution has hampered the understanding of the behaviors of ultracold atoms and molecules. The new research directions in this project will provide a guide for the ongoing experiments on ultracold atoms and molecules. Because of the quantum similarity between cold atoms and other particles, such as electrons in solid state materials and protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei (they all satisfy the Schrdinger equation), theoretical research of ultracold atoms and molecules may also shed new light on material science and nuclear science. The PI plans to integrate his research and educational activities by creating a special topics course on Few-Body Quantum Physics and training doctoral students who will learn advanced scientific and mathematical techniques."

As a result, the mathematical and computational tools for analyzing wave scattering play an essential role in our scientific and technological infrastructure.  This research will develop and extend techniques of scattering theory and apply them both to answer questions about fundamental laws of physics and to analyze and design experiments studying microelectromechanical systems in nanotechnology.  Because of the fundamental role scattering theory plays across science and engineering, this research is accessible to and provides valuable training for undergraduate students planning careers in a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.  The project will thus promote key national priorities through both advances in fundamental and applied research and in building the core technical capabilities of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Through education and outreach, the impact of this project will extend beyond the students directly involved to the broader college and local community as well.<br/><br/>More specifically, this research will develop extensions of the variable phase method in analytic scattering theory and then use these techniques to address subtle questions in quantum field theory.  These applications include computations of quantum corrections to the energies and charges of magnetic monopoles in models of particle physics, analysis of the effects of quantum fluctuations in curved spacetime and their consequences for general relativity and quantum gravity, and precise determination of Casimir forces in systems relevant to nanotechnology.

The ATLAS and CMS experiments are the two largest experiments currently mounted at the LHC.  The prototypes will be tested at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Israel and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.  The project has a robust plan in place to engage undergraduate students from a diverse community to participate in the development of these new detectors.

Luminosities will exceed 7x10^34 /cm^2/sec in the high luminosity era and so the ZDCs must be extraordinarily radiation hard.  ZDCs are needed to identify the reaction plane orientation in a heavy ion collision and are an essential detector for measuring ultra-peripheral collisions in heavy ion and p-p collisions.

One avenue of exploration is to develop computation based on using quantum information processing (QIP). QIP takes advantage of quantum states, for instance spins of electrons, to encode information. Quantum effects such as ""superposition"" and ""entanglement"" enable QIP devices to process information with shades of gray beyond the conventional black-or-white (so-called 0-or-1) logic, and to attain drastic improvements over conventional devices. However, there are two major challenges to achieving the goal of a QIP-based system. One is to find ways to scale up QIP devices, building on recent experiments with small numbers of quantum bits. The other challenge is to discover more examples, and whole categories, of informational tasks for which QIP devices surpass conventional devices. The goal of this project is to address these key issues using ideas from the study of many-body quantum physics phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism, as, for example, how frustrated quantum spin systems that exhibit exotic magnetism also possess intrinsic capability as a quantum computer. In more general terms, the project will explore ways to use macroscopic quantum order to obtain some quantum advantage in computation and simulation. This research will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary and rapidly expanding field.<br/><br/>The framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MQC) is a convenient way to study the origin of quantum advantages such as quantum speed-up in computation.  MQC needs entangled states as a resource.  This project will examine how certain types of macroscopic entanglement which are naturally found in quantum spin liquid phases of frustrated quantum spin systems called symmetry-protected topological orders (SPTO) can be used as a resource for MQC.  This project will explore how a higher level of entanglement with more intrinsic quantum-gate complexity (Clifford hierarchy) is available by using higher-dimensional SPTO. The new entanglement by 2D SPTO has several features which are not available by conventional universal entanglement (like the cluster state whose SPTO is of a 1D nature), and is in contrast capable of universal quantum computation even by simplest single-spin X, Y, and Z measurements. This project takes advantage of this concrete connection between macroscopic quantum orders and quantum complexity to approach the key issues about scalability and non-classical complexity in quantum computation and simulation. Thus it builds connections between two research fields: quantum information science and quantum many-body physics."

Consequently, research in this area serves the national interest by advancing fundamental science in the United States.  Professor Das will also involve graduate students in this research, thereby providing them with the valuable training necessary to develop into independent scientists and educators. In addition, the results of this research will be used to enhance classroom education.

This correspondence has been used to understand puzzles related to the Hawking radiation of black holes by mapping these puzzles to problems in conventional quantum theory of the type which appears in electroweak and strong interactions. At the same time, this correspondence has thrown valuable light on difficult problems in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems which appear in particle physics, nuclear physics, or cold-atom physics, by mapping these problems onto problems in classical gravity.  Overall, the projects to be tackled have two principal goals.  The first involves deciphering the precise way in which the lower-dimensional non-gravitational theory metamorphoses into a higher-dimensional theory of gravity. This will be done by exploring solvable models, particularly those whose gravity descriptions contain black holes, and by applying the ideas of quantum information theory to understand the emergence of space.

But general relativity is not enough to describe the interior of black holes or the earliest stages of our universe.  In both cases the laws of physics become quantum-mechanical and we therefore need a theory of gravity which is also consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics.  String theory has long been considered the best candidate for such a theory.   Approximately twenty years ago this led to the discovery of the so-called ""holographic principle"".  This remarkable principle allows us to relate quantum-mechanical theories of gravity with other theories that do not involve gravity at all.  As a result, intractable problems in certain gravitational theories are translated into non-gravitational problems --- problems which are often far simpler to solve.  In her research, Professor Caceres aims to develop a further understanding of this correspondence.  Progress in this direction will ultimately provide insights into the physics of the early universe, the interior of black holes, and ultimately the nature of spacetime itself.  As such, this research advances the national interest by fostering the development of basic science within the United States.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Caceres will involve graduate students and postdocs in her research, thereby providing training for junior physicists.

The fundamental particles that interact via this force are the quarks and gluons that build up protons and neutrons, which in turn build up the atomic nuclei at the cores of all atoms. This project aims to study the nature of matter at the very high temperatures reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions.  The group will study how protons and neutrons melt into constituent quarks and gluons, which are no longer bound under these conditions. This high-temperature phase of nuclear matter is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy-ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider have produced striking evidence for QGP formation. The field is moving towards a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP, and this work will contribute to that understanding. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the experimental measurement of two distinct thermodynamic properties of this novel state of nuclear matter with the STAR and the CMS experiments. The first property to be measured is the temperature produced in the hottest stages of the collision. This is done via the study of Upsilon mesons, a bound state of heavy ""bottom"" quarks. In the hot, early stage of the collision even heavy-quark bound states, like the Upsilon, are expected to melt in the collision. The group will study the melting pattern of Upsilons and their excited states with STAR and with CMS in pp, pA, and AA collisions. This measurement will provide crucial information to test models of the deconfinement of quarks in the high-temperature QGP. The second goal is to study the thermodynamic phase structure of the strong force. In particular, testing the existence of a predicted QCD critical point is a key component of this goal. This study is done with STAR by varying the collision energy both in collider and fixed-target collisions, and thereby exploring the transition between normal nuclear matter and QGP matter. Adding the fixed target energy scan is important because the current evidence suggests that the critical point may lie at the lowest energy accessible to the collider, and it is important to scan both above and below this transition. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are aimed at underrepresented minorities and women. The first is to communicate the excitement of high-energy nuclear physics to Latino students at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), through mentoring activities at the conference and support of the UC Davis SACNAS chapter. The second component is promotion of science and physics to elementary and high-school students through visits to elementary schools with large Latino populations, and via participation in the Adopt-A-Physicist program for high schools. Finally, the PIs in the project will mentor undergraduates, including NSF REU students, every year. A key part of these goals is the mentoring of graduate students to become leaders in these activities, since many are women and underrepresented minorities, and are therefore excellent role models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves from merging black holes were recently detected for the first time, confirming a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity and opening an unprecedented new window into the physics of strong gravity and extreme states of matter.  Similarly, the Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs particle, although this discovery does not suggest any way of solving certain issues such as the so-called ""hierarchy problem"" or provide any clear hint of what physics exists at shorter distance scales.   Likewise, there is strong evidence for dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated rate of expansion of the current universe, and for cosmic inflation, a period of explosive expansion just after the Big Bang.  Yet this evidence tells us little about the underlying physical origin of either phenomenon.  A breakthrough in understanding the meaning of these recent profound discoveries would promote the progress of science in a fundamental way, revealing new laws of nature and helping to explain the origin and fate of our universe.   Research in this direction thus advances the national interest by furthering the development of basic science within the United States.  As part of his research, Professor Kleban will investigate the theoretical consequences of Einstein's theory of general relativity in exotic situations, such as during rapid cosmic expansion and near black holes.   He will also study how to understand the effects of quantum mechanics in such situations.  Further, he will study the physics of hypothetical particles called ""axions"" that could play a key role in explaining certain mysterious features of the Standard Model of particle physics.

This project enhances our understanding of these fundamental questions by accelerating nuclei to high energies and measuring gamma and charged particle radiation that is emitted when they interact with other atomic nuclei. The focus is on accelerating beams of atomic nuclei that are unstable to beta decay, living for times as short as seconds. The interactions between atomic nuclei informs our understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei, especially those far from stability that are more weakly bound, as well as helping us to understand how the parents of the stable elements were synthesized. This project will serve to advance our understanding of the structure of and reactions on atomic nuclei away from the valley of stability and their synthesis in stars and their explosions.  It will exploit state-of-the-art instruments and accelerator facilities in the U.S. Central to this effort is enhancing the education of students and preparing them for careers in education and fundamental and applied research. The anticipated nuclear physics results are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos, and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fission fragments.  <br/><br/>The structure of the proposed activities is designed to have a positive impact on the education and training of graduate students. The project will also serve to enhance the diversity of the nuclear science workforce by seeking out early career scientists who are women or come from other under-represented backgrounds. The participation of these early career scholars in the forefront research and the development of arrays of instruments would prepare them for careers in higher education and fundamental and applied research, at national laboratories and in industry. <br/><br/><br/>One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability.   In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number and, in addition, are very sensitive to the presence of deformation.  Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions and are important in calculating the direct component in neutron capture reactions that are responsible for the synthesis of elements heavier than iron. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with radioactive ion beams with energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 40-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 neutron shell closure, accelerated fragments following spontaneous fission of 252Cf and light nuclei important for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stars and their explosions. These studies will be carried out with radioactive ion beams at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University, the ATLAS accelerator facility at Argonne National Laboratory and the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. The focus at NSCL is to constrain the shape of the potential that binds neutrons in a neutron-rich nucleus and, therefore, extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters.  Both charged particles and coincident gamma radiation will be measured with flexible configurations of detectors. At ATLAS, Gammasphere-ORRUBA: Dual Detectors for Experimental Structure Studies will be exploited to probe the fragmentation of single-particle strength with coincidence measurements between charged particles (measured with ORRUBA, the Oak Ridge Rutgers University Barrel Array of position-sensitive silicon strip detectors) and gamma rays (measured with large, highly segmented germanium gamma-ray detector arrays).  The Rutgers-led efforts will be complemented by efforts led by other members of the ORRUBA collaboration.  The results will be compared with theoretical predictions of nuclear structure away from stability and disseminated as input into calculations of nucleosynthesis in stars and their explosions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are powerful scientific methods to learn fundamental properties of materials. Using these techniques to systems more complex than atoms and of direct applied interest is therefore beneficial for the advancement of basic science and technology. The systems to be studied in the current research are Buckminster fullerenes and other larger fullerenes, including atoms/clusters caged inside these molecules, called endofullerenes. These materials hold the promise of exciting applications in areas including quantum computations, superconductivity, biomedical fields, drug delivery research, magnetic resonance imaging, and organic photovoltaics. Hence, understanding the physical and chemical structure and response properties of these systems, including the influence of the fullerene cage on the behavior of the confined species, are matters of great scientific interest. Using large scale computer simulations the program aims to investigate how electrons inside the systems collectively interacts with each other to move internally or to exit the system and how much time they spend to reach the detector. How do the structure and geometry of the system play roles in the mechanism? This will be investigated both for light and fast-ion impact. By choosing exotic antiparticles like positrons to impact on fullerenes the study of the formation of electron-positron pairs, the positronium, is a novel direction of the program.<br/><br/>Numerical methods to be employed to model the systems and their response are based on Density Functional Theory. These methods will also be used to calculate the intensity of the emerging electron flux from the system along a specific direction and/or in all directions. From the complex variation of the detected electron flux as a function of the laser energy or the ion-impact energy researchers will extract valuable information about the system. Furthermore, the time of flight of the electrons from the irradiated target to the detector will be computed and the variation in this flight-time as a function of laser frequency will enable further insights into the scientific processes. Following the impact of positrons, the formation of the positronium (Ps) is a vital process in nature, although no attempt of Ps formation using gas-phase fullerene systems has been made until recent research that came from this program. The science to be learned from the study of Ps formation should be universal for Ps formation from nanosystems ushering new directions of Ps spectroscopy.

This CAREER project aims to meet the continuing demand for better optical sensing of mechanical rotation currently posed by a variety of fields such as nanoscience, precision measurement, remote sensing, and quantum computing. The activity addresses these demands by combining powerful sensing paradigms from the field of linear motion detection with the ability of light to carry orbital angular momentum. It will provide theoretical solutions which can be implemented using available technologies. The ultimate objectives of this research are to develop techniques for measuring mechanical rotation at the quantum level, and thus to identify and to circumvent the limits placed by quantum mechanics on the sensor capabilities. These activities are concomitant with strong technological impact on society, since they aim to establish the route for taking rotation sensor technology to its limits.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate the sensing of nanomechanical rotation in the quantum regime. The proposed sensors will find hitherto undetected torques created by the electromagnetic vacuum, characterize rotational quantum states of macroscopic mechanical systems, allow the nondestructive study of quantized superflow in quantum gases, and measure the rotation of single atoms. The main ideas will combine the established techniques of vibrational optomechanics with the capabilities of optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum. The specific methods will draw on the toolbox of quantum optics and atomic physics techniques. The research program will be integrated with an education plan which includes collaborative visits for students to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, introduction of the orbital angular momentum of light into the undergraduate Quantum Optics laboratory at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and exhibition of rotational toys to the public vis--vis the yearly Imagine RIT event as well as the Science Saturdays at the Rochester Museum and Science Center."

The models used in this project draw from the fields of polymer and soft-materials physics  and infuse novel physical concepts and understanding into problems involving living cells and organisms. The engagement of both in vitro and in vivo experimental measurements will provide guidance on the implementation of quantitative theory into practical biological problems. Results from this program will be widely disseminated through publications, conferences, and an online repository of simulation tools as well as descriptions, press releases, and educational tools for use by the broad scientific community and the general public. The lab of the PI is an ideal environment for training quantitative biologists who are capable of tackling a diverse range of fundamental and applied problems in living systems, and the lab's commitment to diversity and educational development has led to alumni of the group who are making major contributions to both academic and industrial research. This program develops and implements laboratory science and engineering teaching modules for the education of high school students who are being treated for childhood cancer and other illnesses. This program is piloted at the Hospital School at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, and the PI engages undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford to develop the program, resulting in an exciting opportunity for students to enrich their educational experience with broader outreach. Ongoing efforts aim to broadly disseminate this program nationally as a general laboratory science curriculum for hospital-school education.<br/><br/>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have the daunting task of compactly packaging their immense genome while simultaneously maintaining gene regulatory control and the ability for chromosomal DNA to be replicated and segregated in a robust manner. Chromosomal DNA within living cells is manipulated and accessed by a host of proteins that perform numerous functions that are orchestrated throughout the cell<br/>cycle. The physical manipulation of chromosomal DNA is central to its function, and achieving a fundamental quantitative framework for predicting and interpreting chromosomal organization and dynamics would be instrumental to our understanding of living systems. This research program aims to tackle three major biological processes involving chromosomal DNA in prokaryotic cells: regulation, segregation, and organization. These efforts are delineated into three complementary thrusts that establish fundamental physical insight into the orchestrated function of proteins that influence chromosomal organization and dynamics. In Thrust 1, the PI addresses the impact of DNA supercoiling on gene regulation. This effort focuses on two prototypical regulatory proteins (Lac repressor and  repressor) that serve as examples of regulatory proteins that engage DNA at multiple sites to form a regulatory complex. Cellular control of supercoiling elicits major changes in gene regulation, and this thrust will directly address how topoisomerases and regulatory proteins orchestrate their function. Thrust 2 aims to address segregation of DNA through the ParABS system's highly conserved prokaryotic segregation apparatus. The mysterious function of this system is unlike motor or cytoskeletal proteins in that there is no obvious force generating function. The efforts will aim to resolve how temporal correlations in chromosomal dynamics result in directed motion in a burning-bridge mechanism for the ParABS system. In Thrust 3, the PI will tackle the interplay between RNA polymerase and condensin in dictating chromosomal organization. Active forces generated by RNA polymerase displace proteins along DNA, and the resulting impact of these nonequilibrium processes on chromosomal organization will be addressed in this thrust, providing new physical insight into the formation and maintenance of organized domains within the cell.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

However, as technology pushes forward, following Moore's law in computer engineering, it is gradually reaching limits where classical physics will no longer suffice.  At this point, electrical and optical engineers will need to use quantum physics, which, up to the end of 20th century, had been mostly the subject of fundamental study.  A key component for quantum technologies will be the ability to engineer quantum states of light, or photons.  This research project will address the problem of quantum state engineering by exploring new ways to control the shape of single-photon quantum states using quantum interference.  Because single-photon states are a basic building block for quantum technologies, this project will support the development of practical and versatile quantum devices for applications such as quantum information processing.  The table-top experiments in this project are also an ideal platform for training and preparing next generation quantum physicists.  Undergraduate students and graduate students will be involved in this research program.  This project will deepen their understanding of quantum physics, which in turn will promote further applications using quantum interference techniques.<br/><br/>Photon indistinguishability is essential to achieve complete quantum interference, which is the key in many protocols in optical quantum information processing with linear optical elements.  The achievement of photon indistinguishability in experiments is through mode matching of photon states. While spatial modes of optical fields are relatively easy to manage, the temporal modes are much more complicated, especially for ultra-short pulses. In this research program, this team will employ a recently developed nonlinear quantum interferometric technique to achieve custom engineering of the spectral and temporal modes of the quantum states produced from ultra-fast nonlinear optical interactions. The essence of the technique is in the manipulation of the spectral phase shift that controls the nonlinear interaction via quantum interference and leads to interference filtering and eventually engineering of the spectral profiles of the output states for single mode operation. This team will implement the technique experimentally and demonstrate its effectiveness with a multi-photon interference experiment to achieve the efficient production of transform-limited single-photon states in single modes. Quantum state engineering is important for experimental implementations of quantum information protocols. It can be used to tailor the temporal modes of the optical fields to fit the experimental requirement and thus has very practical significance in the study of quantum information processing. This investigation provides a new approach for quantum state engineering.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds.

The baseline design for this new experiment will deploy an initial 50 kg payload of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) detectors. Some of these detectors will be operated in a manner that provides very low energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to the lowest dark matter particle masses (< 0.5 GeV) and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment.

Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring the highest energies ever probed.  The LHC recently discovered a remarkable new particle, the Higgs boson, and is now studying the properties of this new particle.   The LHC may also discover additional new particles as well.  Against this backdrop, Professor Ruderman will pursue an original program of research and education concentrating on the origins of dark matter and the Higgs.  He will study the exciting possibility that there exist new hidden sectors of particles which have thus far escaped experimental detection because they are very weakly interacting with ordinary particles.  He will explore new models in which dark matter is a hidden-sector particle, or in which the Higgs boson interacts with hidden-sector particles.  In order to help in spreading physics to a broad audience, Professor Ruderman will also establish a competitive ""Physics in Media Travel Award"".

Resulting films will be screened at local high schools, and resulting stories will be disseminated online in various journalism venues.<br/><br/>More specifically, Professor Ruderman will explore novel cosmologies for hidden-sector dark matter in which the annihilation rate is exponentially suppressed, predicting dark matter exponentially lighter than the TeV scale. This exponential suppression occurs when dark matter annihilates into heavier states, or is in equilibrium with heavier particles that are annihilating.   Professor Ruderman will develop new observational tests for light dark matter, including searches for UV and soft X-ray photons emitted by dark-matter decays or annihilations.

Responding to this challenge, this project will provide theoretical input to the determination with higher precision of many fundamental physical constants, such as the electron-muon and electron-proton mass ratios, the proton charge radius, and the Rydberg constant. The new theoretical understanding developed here will be used in the next CODATA analysis of the fundamental physical constants.

While the questions that string theory attempts to answer are physical, the path to those answers frequently leads to cutting-edge challenges in modern mathematics. This award will fund a collaborative program of research to explore the physics that arises from string compactifications. The goals of this work include strengthening the links between string theory and current progress in particle physics by developing new foundational tools for the subject of string phenomenology. In addition, Professors Anderson, Gray and Sharpe aim to further bound and characterize the geometries arising in string compactifications. Experience shows that when strong physical requirements are expressed in the language of geometry, they can open the door to new and unexpected results in both physics and mathematics.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of basic science.    Professors Anderson, Gray and Sharpe will involve junior scientists in this project, including a postdoctoral researcher and several graduate students who will take part in the collaborative research. Their efforts will include the organizing of conferences and workshops that will increase dialog between physicists and mathematicians on pressing problems at the boundary of both fields. In all of these aspects of student training and professional dialog, Professors Anderson, Sharpe and Gray are committed to actively encouraging the inclusion of under-represented groups into the frontline of progress in the sciences. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PIs will study two of the most flexible frameworks for four-dimensional compactifications of string theory: Heterotic string theory and F-theory. Within heterotic string theory, novel descriptions of the physical and geometric moduli spaces will be used to compute previously undetermined aspects of the effective theory, including the N=1 matter field Kahler potential and physically normalized Yukawa couplings. The nonperturbative contributions to Yukawa couplings will also be computed via quantum sheaf cohomology, a generalization of ordinary quantum cohomology. This work will explore new dualities including (0,2) mirror symmetry, as well as the global structure of the moduli space of SCFT's. Within F-theory, new results in the geometry of elliptic fibrations will be used to study the properties of singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and their links to Hitchin systems, as well as to study the implications of the ubiquity of multiply fibered manifolds for string dualities and effective theories. Recent progress in geometry will be used to extract new features of the effective theories describing F-theory compactifications, including the explicit four-dimensional field-dependent form of flux contributions to the superpotential."

Dilute, ultra-cold atomic vapors provide a unique arena for the study of collective, many-body phenomena, and for exploring the relationship between few-body dynamics on the one-hand and the behavior of many-body systems on the other. This project aims at the development of improved theoretical understanding of a number of key aspects of few-body systems that are deeply quantum mechanical in nature and which occur within ultra-cold quantum gases. The work could potentially have unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological ramifications. For example, the ability to regulate few-body interactions within a complex system could significantly impact the possibilities for quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. Furthermore, a deep understanding of the ultra-cold atom interactions can spawn applications to atomic clocks, quantum information science, and the exploration of many novel phases of matter. <br/><br/>A key element of the project is the design of computational methods and techniques of analysis capable of describing ultra-cold few-body interactions far more realistically than any other existing methodologies. For example, the project will explore whether a laser field can change the interactions among three or four nearby atoms that are part of a many-body Bose-Einstein condensate. The central idea is that whenever a few atoms within the large ensemble temporarily collide, they can absorb or emit radiation as a unit. This resonant radiation has distinct frequencies which can be detected spectroscopically or tuned to alter the few-body dynamics. In accord with its general objective, the project has two specific goals; to develop coherent control of few-body interactions, and to explore new fundamental phenomena in the exotic interaction regime produced by artificial gauge fields. The project will also build on recent discoveries of few-body, Efimov resonances, in order to explore the relevance of Efimov physics to the control of many-body ultra-cold systems. The key educational impact of this work derives from the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers in state of the art theoretical and computational research techniques."

These are two very active areas of study, widely regarded as enablers for future quantum-based technologies, including quantum computation.  The principal aim of the project is to further the development of variational algorithms for describing non-relativistic continuous model systems. These algorithms can be used to describe model systems of interacting cold-atom gases with mass-imbalance, including in the presence of optical lattices, and/or with mixtures of fermions and bosons. The research will be conducted in close collaboration with students and in an open manner. Broad dissemination is planned by including research-developed computational tools in graduate courses and by disseminating results in multiple venues, including to the general public. The latter will be done in collaboration with Cincinnati's Museum of Natural History and Science and involving students as part of their formative experience in science communication.<br/><br/>The new continuum Matrix-Product States (cMPS) ansatz will be the main focus of attention in the proposed research. It constitutes the meeting of ideas coming from the theory of integrable systems and the tensor-network methods of quantum-information theory. Furthermore, cMPS brings in a new alternative to look at one-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) from a variational perspective. They provide valuable non-perturbative insights into the structure of strongly-coupled QFTs, whose fundamental nature permeates many different branches of physics. Developing these new theoretical and computational ideas in the context of quantum simulations using cold atoms will bring in an extra dimension of merit and add to the growing synergies between cold-atom experiments and many-body theories. In terms of computational infrastructure, the project will leverage the resources of the Ohio Supercomputing Center."

Dilute, ultra-cold atomic vapors provide a unique arena for the study of collective, many-body phenomena, and for exploring the relationship between few-body dynamics on the one-hand and the behavior of many-body systems on the other. This project aims at the development of improved theoretical understanding of a number of key aspects of few-body systems that are deeply quantum mechanical in nature and which occur within ultra-cold quantum gases. The work could potentially have unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological ramifications. For example, the ability to regulate few-body interactions within a complex system could significantly impact the possibilities for quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. Furthermore, a deep understanding of the ultra-cold atom interactions can spawn applications to atomic clocks, quantum information science, and the exploration of many novel phases of matter. <br/><br/>A key element of the project is the design of computational methods and techniques of analysis capable of describing ultra-cold few-body interactions far more realistically than any other existing methodologies. For example, the project will explore whether a laser field can change the interactions among three or four nearby atoms that are part of a many-body Bose-Einstein condensate. The central idea is that whenever a few atoms within the large ensemble temporarily collide, they can absorb or emit radiation as a unit. This resonant radiation has distinct frequencies which can be detected spectroscopically or tuned to alter the few-body dynamics. In accord with its general objective, the project has two specific goals; to develop coherent control of few-body interactions, and to explore new fundamental phenomena in the exotic interaction regime produced by artificial gauge fields. The project will also build on recent discoveries of few-body, Efimov resonances, in order to explore the relevance of Efimov physics to the control of many-body ultra-cold systems.

In the not too distant future the building blocks of these circuits is set to reach atomic scale, where the laws of quantum physics will replace the familiar laws of classical physics that govern our everyday world. Surprisingly, theoretical studies have shown that if we can manipulate and control quantum devices as well as we now manipulate and control classical devices, entirely new avenues will open up to process information according to quantum mechanics. As a result, quantum computers will in principle be able to solve some important computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. It is also thought that a simpler class of devices, commonly referred to as analog quantum simulators, may provide approximate solutions to important problems in chemistry and materials science that are currently intractable. Though a functional quantum computer remains a distant goal, the transformative ideas of quantum computation and simulation hold promise to radically expand the capabilities of computer and information technology and sustain its future growth.<br/><br/>This award builds on previous accomplishments by the Principal Investigators in the science and engineering field known as quantum control, which studies how physical devices governed by quantum mechanics can be manipulated and controlled with high precision, even in the presence of inevitable device imperfections and outside disturbances.  The first objective of this award is to develop new techniques whereby one can evaluate and verify the operation of quantum devices.  This will be done through the use of protocols known as quantum tomography, which determine the state and behavior of a quantum device through a series of carefully chosen measurements.  The challenge will be to make these protocols more efficient, i. e., minimizing the number of measurements required, and also more robust, e. g., reliable in the presence of imperfections.  The second objective of this award is to realize an analog quantum simulator based on a single atom.  This single-atom device will be used to simulate a model system whose behavior is known to be chaotic, i. e., hypersensitive to imperfections and outside disturbances.  By quantifying the accuracy of the simulator in the presence of known imperfections, this research will address essential but so far unanswered questions: How far can one trust the predictions of an analog quantum simulator in this challenging but common scenario?  And can its accuracy and reliability be improved through state-of-the-art techniques for quantum control?  The answer to these questions is relevant for large, federally funded research programs in analog quantum simulation at top research institutions across the US.<br/><br/>State-of-the-art quantum control is approaching the thresholds for fault-tolerant operation on a few physical platforms and is steadily improving on many others. As a result, researchers are now pursuing architectures for rudimentary digital quantum computation and analog quantum simulation (AQS). To continue on this path towards useful quantum information processing (QIP), there is an urgent need for more sophisticated tools in the areas of quantum control and quantum tomography, and especially for protocols that are resistant to real-world errors and imperfections. Furthermore, the quantum information community is heavily invested in AQS under the assumption that errors are less critical than in a digital quantum computer. This makes it imperative to study the tolerance of AQS to errors, even in the absence of decoherence, and the prospects of robust control in the context of complex dynamics such as quantum chaos.<br/><br/>This award will focus on quantum control and measurement, and their application in quantum tomography and analog quantum simulation.  The work will build on well established ideas from optimal control and measurement theory, bringing these to bear on a unique experimental testbed: electron-nuclear spins of cold 133Cs atoms in their electronic ground state. This system provides long coherence times, can be manipulated with radio-frequency, microwave, and optical fields, is accessible to measurement though Stern-Gerlach analysis, and has a 16-dimensional Hilbert space, large enough to explore non-trivial tasks of QIP. With its proven capability to apply high-fidelity unitary maps and perform high-fidelity orthogonal measurements, the testbed provides the building blocks needed for QIP at levels of increasing complexity. The planned research is a mixture of theory and experiment, and will address topics in quantum measurement and tomography. In addition, analog quantum simulation, studying the quantum simulation of a spin-15/2 Quantum Kicked Top (QKT) and the use of the QKT paradigm to explore robust quantum simulation in the presence of chaos will be explored. Because the methodologies of robust control and tomography are independent of any particular platform, results from this award will serve as a benchmark for what can be achieved, and a template for similar advances elsewhere in laboratories working with different physical systems. This will help facilitate progress in the broader field of QIP."

These are some of the questions that have fascinated humankind since the beginning of time, and our search for answers has contributed enormously to the development of mathematics and physics as well as technology.  Professor Vafa's research, motivated by deep puzzles such as the nature and strength of gravity and the nature of the recently-discovered Higgs boson, will continue to develop the boundaries between physics and mathematics.  This work will also develop new analytical tools which may find applications far from theoretical particle physics and string theory.  Thus, this research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science.  As part of this project, Professor Vafa will also continue to inspire talented young people to follow the difficult but crucial discipline of science.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Vafa will extend his previous results by considering compactifying six-dimensional theories on various manifolds of diverse dimensions with suitable background fields turned on, with the goal of developing a classification of lower-dimensional CFT's.  Professor Vafa will also revisit and expand upon an old conjecture of his.  About 10 years ago Vafa proposed that most of the naively consistent-looking quantum-gravitational theories are actually inconsistent and do not arise in a consistent string compactification.   Since then, considerable evidence has accumulated for this viewpoint.  A notable example of this is the ""weak gravity conjecture"" (WGC) which was proposed by Vafa and collaborators and which states that in any consistent theory of quantum gravity, gravity must always be the weakest force.  Evidence for the WGC has grown over the years, and recently Ooguri and Vafa proposed that a sharpened version of the WGC implies that supersymmetry is a key ingredient in the AdS/CFT duality.  If true, this would have dramatic implications about the models of holography being pursued in condensed-matter systems and in heavy-ion collisions, as these systems do not typically exhibit supersymmetry.   As part of the broader impacts of his research, Professor Vafa hopes to continue developing his freshman seminar course, ""Physics, Math and Puzzles"".  This course aims to showcase deep principles of physics through simple mathematical puzzles, and has attracted an increased number of physics majors.  Furthermore Professor Vafa is planning to convert the course to a book so that it will be accessible to a wider audience of potentially interested students of physics and mathematics.  Finally, Professor Vafa plans to continue running the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics summer workshops at Stony Brook University.  These annual workshops continue to have a deep impact in educating some of the best young minds interested in theoretical physics, especially in questions related to string theory and the nearby areas of condensed-matter physics and mathematics."

They can induce specific chemical reactions which are relevant to dielectric aging, surface engineering, radiation damage, cancer therapy, and atmospheric physics. A particularly important process is dissociative electron attachment (DEA) involving electron capture by a molecule with the following break-up of a molecular bond. In spite of decades of experimental and theoretical studies of this process the understanding of it is far from complete. This is especially relevant to DEA processes involving molecular clusters, which are many molecules loosely bound by weak forces. The present project plans to theoretically study electron-molecule collision processes in gas phase and in cluster environments. The proposed activities will advance the theory of electron interaction with molecules and clusters, and molecules in a cluster environment. This research will create new knowledge in the areas connecting collision physics with chemical control, radiobiology and atmospheric science. The research will involve interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations with scientists from other fields. It will train students in broader areas including several subdisciplines. Examples demonstrating the role of low-energy electrons in different areas of chemistry, biology and environmental science will be incorporated in teaching.<br/><br/>The project's major focus is on the development of the nonlocal complex potential theory of DEA for polyatomic molecules. This theory would allow a proper incorporation of long-range interaction effects into the DEA description for polyatomic molecules which has previously been absent. These effects might cause special type of resonances, vibrational Feshbach resonances, in DEA. They were previously described in the approximation of one reaction coordinate, and the project includes plans to generalize the theory to the case of several vibrational degrees of freedom. In addition, the effects of the cluster environment on the DEA processes will be investigated by the use of multiple-scattering theory. Almost no information on these effects,  experimental or theoretical, is presently available, although they are  important for the understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage to  biologically-relevant molecules."

However, design of combinatorial regimens cannot be done by empirical trial and error in the clinical setting. The goal of the project is to blend a systems biology network-based theoretical framework with an integrated experimental and analytical program in order to address the combinatorial regimen challenge in oncology. Based on areas of exemplary clinical need, investigator expertise, and the availability of patient-derived tumor tissue, the project will focus on BRAF-mutant melanoma and PIK3CA-mutant, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer as initial tumor types in which to pilot the approach. In addition the project will offer interdisciplinary training and research experience to postdoctoral and clinical fellows, graduate students, and indirectly to all members of the groups who participate. Professional development of all trainees will be enhanced by yearly meetings of the whole project team which will include tutorials on modeling and experimental methodologies. A symposium on the quantitative science of cancer will be organized at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute during the third year of this project. Team members are also committed to broadening the participation of women and under-represented minorities in STEM fields by pro-active recruitment and mentoring.<br/><br/>The project will integrate dynamic modeling of signal transduction pathways relevant to cell proliferation and apoptosis, genomic and evolutionary analyses of tumor cells, and systematic cell death and therapeutic resistance studies. The dynamic models will be informed, tested, and iterated using experimental approaches applied to relevant cancer model systems. The experiments leverage emerging technologies such as pooled genome-wide open reading frame screens, dynamic BH3 profiling of cancer cells' closeness to the apoptotic threshold, whole exome sequencing and single cell RNA-seq analysis. The models will recapitulate steady state signaling network activation, acute adaptive effects of treatment (e.g., feedback dysregulation) and the range of drug-resistant states that may emerge following longer-term drug exposure. Tumor cell heterogeneity will be represented by the implementation of different initial configurations or state overrides of network components. Using newly developed systems control methodologies, the models will be used to prioritize drug combinations and dosing/scheduling principles for in vitro and in vivo testing. The final result will be a theoretical and experimentally validated approach that can be generalized across many other cancer types. This project develops a new framework to address cancer as a deregulated complex dynamical system and it will lead to an improved understanding of adaptive and acquired drug resistance mechanisms. The project will make a significant contribution toward a major goal of cancer precision medicine, namely the identification of optimal high-order combinations for individual cancer patients. The project will also establish new connections between evolutionary theory and dynamical systems theory. The theoretical and methodological advances will be applicable or adaptable to other cancers and diseases in general, leading to potentially transformative impacts on human health. <br/><br/>This proposal is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division."

The project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter to study the organization of biological membranes. The modeling efforts will develop new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations. The current understanding of how multi-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) respond to osmotic pressure differentials is incomplete, and experimental observations indicate that a non-linear model coupling membrane dynamics with 3D fluid flow is needed to fully explain the non-linearities of the system. Developing this theoretical framework and providing insight into the underlying physics is crucial for the understanding of how membranes undergo morphological transitions. These models will explain existing experiments and also predict membrane response to different osmotic loads and membrane compositions. Understanding this process is important for better experimental design of in vitro reconstituted systems such as vesicles and also cellular systems. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, using mathematics and physics in biological systems. Both fields will benefit from this approach to studying biological phenomena; the theory will be grounded in experiments and also make predictions to design future experiments. This research will be integrated into the teaching efforts of the PIs in developing new courses at the interface of engineering and biology. The PIs will continue their efforts in enhancing diversity in the UC system while pursuing the research program. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and proteins. A key characteristic of this heterogeneity is the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. This coexistence is thought to be the key organizing principle for the formation of lipid rafts. Studying the formation and organization of the different phases in cellular system is experimentally challenging, given the complex nature of the cells. Giant unilamellar vesicles with controlled compositions, allow us to study lipid behavior in bilayer membranes and gain insight into phase behavior which is important for understanding cellular membranes. Although GUVs are used widely experimentally, our theoretical understanding of lipid phase separation remains rudimentary, since existing models focus on the line tension between preexisting domains and not on domain growth and swell-burst cycles, which are the features observed experimentally. The objectives of this project are to formulate quantitative models of isothermal phase separation and swell-burst cycle in multi-component GUVs and test model predictions experimentally. STUDY 1-DYNAMICS OF SOLUTE EFFLUX. We will use theory, simulations, and experiments to understand the factors that control pore radius, vesicle radius, and the lifetime of the pore. STUDY 2-PHASE SEPARATION IN OSMOTICALLY STRESSED VESICLES. Using a viscoelastic model of multi-component lipid membranes, we will investigate the role of governing energetics in domain growth versus true phase transitions. We will experimentally test the model predictions by tuning the osmotic pressure difference, lipid composition, and sample temperature. STUDY 3-COUPLING BETWEEN DOMAIN FORMATION AND SWELL-BURST CYCLES. In this study, we will develop the mathematical framework to model the complete dynamics of the oscillatory phase separation coupled with the swell-burst cycle observed in the preliminary experiments. This model will combine the dynamics of pore formation outlined in Study 1, with the domain growth model including membrane viscosity in Study 2. The significance of the proposed activities lies in its promise to not only elucidate the fundamental properties of mixtures of lipids reduced dimensional, bilayer configuration but also furnish design principles for designing synthetic protocellular compartments for applications spanning in vitro production of proteins, chemistry in confinement, and delivery of biomedically relevant cargo (e.g., enzymes, drugs, and imaging agents). Using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, this work will be able to provide insight into the complexities of lipid membranes. The long-term impact of the proposed activities stems from the fact that the project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter. The modeling efforts outlined here will result in new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations."

The program offers seminars and trips that expose students to a wide variety of subjects and career opportunities while building a sense of community, and aims to recruit and educate the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Potential research topics include: magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas; chaos and synchronism in large systems of network coupled components; dynamics of granular and soft-matter flow; development of singularities in fluids and solids; nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and charged particle beams; autonomous control of vehicles with forecast uncertainty; and nonlinear physics of living systems. A weekly seminar series will complement and reinforce the learning experience. The seminar topics will be equally divided into research talks and skill development workshops. Research talks will expose students to state-of-the-art research in nonlinear science at a level appropriate for undergraduates. Skills workshops will focus on fellowship/graduate school preparation, oral and written communication, and research ethics. Students will give oral presentations and participate in a poster session on the final day of the program, and funding will be provided to all students to subsequently present their work at a relevant national or regional conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program focuses on direct measurements of nuclear reaction and decay processes that determine the life of stars and the origin of the elements in the universe. This program addresses key nuclear processes that define the timescales of stellar evolution and explosion processes.  Another component is the study of low energy fusion reactions during the last days of a stellar life prior to supernova explosion. The program also explores the nuclear structure effects and weak interaction processes that are guiding large scale nucleosynthesis processes. The research is performed primarily by using the accelerators of the Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Notre Dame, which are uniquely designed to probe stellar reactions through a number of experimental techniques. The experimental results expand our knowledge of the fundamental structure of the nucleus as a multi-body quantum system; they also provide new insight for the astrophysics community on the origin of the elements and the chemical evolution of the cosmos from the Big Bang to the present.  The NSL is uniquely equipped for performing this kind of research in a university environment.  The award will support the training of a large number of graduate (approximately 30) and undergraduate students (approximately 20) in experimental and theoretical techniques to be ready to join the nuclear workforce of the nation. <br/><br/>The experimental program is based on the use of two accelerators at the NSL. Intense stable ion beams from the single ended 5U Pelletron are used for the direct study of low-energy capture and fusion reactions. Heavy ion beams are used to investigate such reactions in inverse kinematic technique using the St. GEORGE recoil separator. This separator is unique and serves as blueprint for the design of the SECAR separator at FRIB. The FN tandem accelerator is used as a multi-purpose instrument. It is operated as a driver for the production of radioactive beams at the TwinSol facility, the nationss first instrument for producing low energy radioactive beams. These beams allow direct reaction measurements with and the trapping of light radioactive particles at levels not possible at large national facilities. The FN also serves the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) program at the NSL, testing geological and cosmological samples for long-lived radioactivities.  A large number of nuclear structure experiments is based on the operation of this machine using a variety of particle and gamma spectroscopy techniques.  A smaller fraction of the program relies on the use of other national and international facilities to take advantage of higher energy beams not available at the NSL."

Nelson, and Tomasz R. Taylor at Northeastern University. <br/><br/>After nearly forty years of experimental searches, the Higgs boson (the particle that is responsible for giving mass to all the particles in the universe) has been discovered in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).   After the discovery of the Higgs boson, the LHC has been upgraded to twice its previous energy in order to search for new physics beyond the Higgs boson.  It is known that our current understanding of particle physics (as encapsulated within the co-called Standard Model) is not the full story as it does not explain the existence of dark matter, does not explain why our universe has a huge excess of matter over anti-matter, and also does not explain the gravitational force.  With support from this award, Professors Nath, Nelson, and Taylor will work to develop new theories that address those issues. Quite remarkably, this work will have direct experimental consequences which can be tested in future experiments at the LHC.  Further, their work also has implications for cosmology, and some of their results can be tested in underground experiments looking for signals of dark matter and in satellite experiments searching for dark matter and anti-matter in the universe.  Thus the research of these PI's will enhance our understanding of the basic components of the universe.  This area of research advances the national interest in that it allows us to push the boundaries of science and test the laws of physics which have thus far not been tested at such large energies.   The results arising from the supported research will be disseminated in a variety of ways:  through posting on the archives, through publication in standard journals, through conference talks and workshops, and through more general outreach to the public. In addition there is a strong educational component to the award. The projects supported by the award will be used to train Ph.D. thesis students as well as to mentor undergraduate physics majors regarding developments in particle physics. The award  will also allow the continuation of the highly successful TheoryNet outreach program, which brings theoretical physicists from New England universities into high-school physics classrooms from Rhode Island to New Hampshire, reaching an estimated 5,000 high-school students in the area."

However, quantum computers are difficult to build because they are very sensitive to quantum mechanical noise, or decoherence.  This project will develop new ways to overcome decoherence by using novel types of quantum error-correcting codes. Efforts to circumvent decoherence are important because quantum error correction may enable fault-tolerant quantum computing with practical devices.  This project will investigate ways to improve the efficiency of quantum error-correcting codes so that fewer physical resources are needed in order to implement error-correcting protocols.  This would allow significant quantum computations to be done on smaller, more reasonably sized, devices.  This project will also train students who participate in this research on fundamental topics in quantum information science, and this will help to prepare them for careers in academics or high technology industries.<br/><br/>Even with fault-tolerant designs, constructing a quantum computer in the near term is a challenge because fault-tolerance requires a large amount of overhead:  each logical quantum bit (qubit) needed by a perfect quantum computer could require thousands or even tens of thousands of physical qubits after being protected by codes.  This project aims to dramatically reduce the overhead needed for fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Instead of encoding each logical qubit separately, much more efficient codes are used that encode many logical qubits in the same codeword.  Computing with such multi-qubit codes requires new techniques, which this project will study:  logical teleportation, state distillation, and the development of different kinds of codes (such as quantum low-density parity-check codes), with different properties.  If everything works well, the overhead could be reduced to as low as a few tens of physical qubits per logical qubit.  This would allow nontrivial quantum computations by computers of a reasonable size."

They are also relevant for a variety of medical applications such as sterilization of medical equipment and wound healing. All these applications are based on the ability of the plasma to induce distinct surface reactions in a controlled way. In order to optimize these applications, plasma simulations, including a realistic implementation of plasma-surface interactions, are crucial. In this project, a new diagnostic to measure key aspects of the plasma-surface interaction physics will be developed, and results will be implemented into a computational model. Results obtained from this research will also be incorporated into graduate level lectures on low temperature plasma science.<br/><br/>Most simulations of capacitive radio frequency plasmas (CCP) only include constant ion induced electron emission and electron reflection at guessed probabilities. Any dependencies on the incident particle energy, angle, and surface material as well as other effects are neglected. This leads to an incorrect description of the particle heating dynamic and flux-energy distribution functions (FEDF). For many surface materials and gases secondary electron emission coefficients induced by electron, ion, and neutral impact as well as particle reflection and sputter rates are unknown in the presence of plasmas that alter the surface conditions. In this project, a novel simulation based diagnostic to measure effective gamma-coefficient by Optical Emission Spectroscopy in the plasma will be developed. Realistic energy and surface dependent electron emission and reflection coefficients for different incident particle species will then be implemented into PIC simulations of CCPs.  The simulation code will be benchmarked against experiments and the effects of realistic surface coefficients on the electron heating dynamics and the control of FEDFs of different particle species will be studied.

Intrinsically fragile, quantum phenomena are difficult to observe and study, let alone explain. Since the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in the mid-1990s, ultracold gases (gases at nearly zero absolute temperature) that are trapped and manipulated with electromagnetic fields in vacuum chambers have provided a unique window for the exploration of the quantum world. Experiments with ultracold gases are examining quantum effects when atoms are allowed to move only in one spatial direction. This reduced dimensionality can exaggerate ""quantum-ness"" and produce novel states of matter. This project will develop theoretical models to describe such states and study their observable properties. The models to be developed are expected to aid in the understanding of materials in which electrons interact strongly and in which their motion along some spacial direction is constrained; for example, in nano-scale wires. The properties of these systems, at odds with those of traditionally studied unconstrained (three-dimensional) quantum systems, might be essential to the understanding of a wide range of nano-devices.<br/> <br/>This theoretical research will explore phenomena in quantum gases in equilibrium and far from equilibrium. In equilibrium, one of the questions to be answered is whether the adiabatic loading of three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional optical lattices results in one-dimensional gases that are in thermal equilibrium, or whether generalized Gibbs ensembles are needed to describe them. The researchers will also study phenomena which result when an additional weaker lattice is added along the one-dimensional gas, and the associated quantum phases that are realized experimentally. Far from equilibrium, this project will explore the expansion dynamics of one-dimensional gases in the presence of interactions, with or without an optical lattice along the expansion direction, as well as experiments in which parameters such as the strength of the confining potential or the lattice depth are periodically modulated in time. Another problem to be explored is the result of band-mapping procedures in experiments in which the atoms are far-from-equilibrium and interact strongly. The research proposed will be mostly carried out by two graduate students who will be trained in computational and many-body quantum physics. The PI will design an advanced graduate course on quantum statistical mechanics, and will contribute to the Hazleton Integration Project (http://www.hazletonintegrationproject.com) by giving talks at the Hazleton One Community Center about science in general and physics in particular."

Through experimentally quantifying this so-called shape coexistence, the research addresses the question, ""How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge"", as outlined by the broader nuclear physics community in ""Reaching for the Horizon: The 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science"". The experiments investigating shape coexistence are performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and build on the principal investigator's experience using beta-decay to study exotic nuclei. To expand the impact of this project, the educational component will provide a new and unique physics summer school experience for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Mississippi.

This information on the nuclear deformation serves as a unique fingerprint of different nuclear configurations and a stringent test of theoretical predictions. Transition strength information will be obtained for neutron-rich nuclei near neutron numbers of 20 and 50, which define regions where shape coexistence is predicted to occur yet remains to be quantified.  The objective of the education component is to develop a physics summer school for high-school aged students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The summer school will offer students with ASD in Mississippi an opportunity to experience physics, including nuclear physics, in a highly interactive way.

Extreme conditions can be produced in the laboratory - the high-energy particle accelerators are an example - but often only after great investments in both scientific personnel and infrastructure.  For this reason, over the past two decades physicists interested in fundamental physics have increasingly turned to astrophysics, using the exotic conditions already existing in Nature to test the understanding of the underlying laws of physics.  This strategy has proven successful: the high fluxes of neutrinos available from our Sun and cosmic rays led to the discovery of neutrino mass and flavor mixing; studies of the velocities of stars bound in galaxies and galaxy clusters revealed that 85% of the matter in the universe is dark, hidden from us, yet crucial in forming the structures we see in the night sky; observations of the thermonuclear explosions of distant stars led us to conclude that our universe is expanding at an increasing rate, dominated by some mysterious, unidentified vacuum energy; and most recently, a new field of gravitational wave astronomy opened up with Advanced LIGO's detection of the merger of two massive black holes, allowing scientists to test physics in the presence of extreme gravitational fields. This project will bring together nuclear physicists and astrophysicists interested in the quantitative modeling of astrophysical systems, to advance the understanding of the properties of neutrinos, the behavior of nuclear matter at the extremes of temperature and density, and the nature of dark matter.  <br/><br/>The main scientific goal of this project is to produce improved models of extreme astrophysical environments, like the cores of supernovae and the interiors of neutron stars, by combining knowledge of the underlying nuclear and neutrino microphysics, with the most advanced tools for numerical simulations in astrophysics.  This will enable to reliably connect available astrophysical observables, such as the electromagnetic and nucleosynthetic signals from supernovae, to underlying fundamental microphysics.  A second goal is to create the kind of interdisciplinary research environment that will allow the training of a new generation of scientists to work effectively at the interface of astrophysics and fundamental physics.  The nuclear physics community will benefit greatly from junior researchers trained in this interdisciplinary science, who can then bridge the gap between astrophysical and astronomical measurements on one hand, and their interpretation in terms of our ""standard model"" of fundamental interactions, and its possible extensions, on the other."

One of the most extreme predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes, compact objects whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them. Investigating gravity in such an extreme regime provides one of the most promising opportunities to learn more about this fundamental force. Another prediction of general relativity, that binary black holes emit gravitational waves that stretch and squeeze spacetime, was recently confirmed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  Black holes are fully described by their masses and spins, but the spins of binary black holes are generally misaligned with their orbital plane, much like the 23 degree misalignment between the Earth's rotation axis and its orbit about the Sun responsible for the seasons. General relativity causes black-hole spins to change direction or precess; this precession leaves detectable signatures in the gravitational waves observed by LIGO. This award supports studies on black-hole spin precession and the extent to which it can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO. This work helps scientists to interpret LIGO observations and thus better understand gravity and the astrophysical origin of black holes responsible for their spin misalignments. The PI and collaborators will also develop an interactive virtual-reality simulation of precessing black holes and the gravitational waves they emit which will be available free online and presented at local public libraries and museums through existing outreach networks of the University of Texas at Dallas. These simulations help the public virtually experience the effects of gravitational waves and enhance public interest and support for science research and education.<br/><br/>This goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the origin and implications of misalignments between binary black-hole spins and their orbital angular momentum. Population-synthesis codes will be used to explore how initial spin misalignments depend on various aspects of astrophysical black-hole formation like mass transfer, tidal alignment, and supernova recoils. The spin distributions generated by these codes will be evolved from black-hole formation until they begin to emit detectable gravitational waves using the PI's newly developed technique for efficiently calculating spin precession on the inspiral timescale. Once the binaries enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors like LIGO, publicly available codes in the LIGO Algorithm Library Suite will be used to generate waveforms and analyze how well the binary black-hole parameters that determine spin precession can be estimated for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The PI and collaborators will also perform and analyze numerical-relativity simulations to assess the reliability of post-Newtonian predictions for spin precession in the final orbits before black-hole merger. This research provides the basis for astrophysical model selection, combining constraints on spin misalignments from many events to distinguish astrophysical models of black-hole formation, such as dynamical formation in a globular cluster (for which spins should be isotropic) versus formation from stellar binaries (which should exhibit a tendency towards aligned spins). The final project will consider how spin precession between black hole formation and merger affects predictions for final black-hole masses, spins, and gravitational recoils.  This project has implications both for the stellar-mass black holes observed by LIGO and recoiling quasars spatially or kinematically offset from their host galaxies sought in galaxy surveys."

From hardened steel in the industrial revolution to the doped silicon used in the electronics era, new ways to understand and control materials often leads to new technology. In a physics perspective, materials are generally made of densely packed atoms with positively charged ionic cores permeated by a negatively charged gas of electrons.  We know the movement of electrons and ions is governed by quantum mechanics.  However, understanding exactly how this motion gives rise to material properties such as superconductivity and exotic forms of magnetism is a major challenge.  This is challenging, in part, because it is difficult to observe individual electrons.  They are small; they move quickly; they interact with each other, and they are easily disturbed.  To address this challenge with a new approach, this project aims to use gasses of ultracold molecules in vacuum to simulate electrons in materials.  Interactions between molecules are expected to make phenomena such as the self-organization of crystalline phases easier to observe.  This team will assemble polar molecules atom-by-atom at ultracold temperatures and then trap molecules in a thin sheet of laser light.  While confined in one dimension, the molecules will still be free to move in two dimensions and interact with each other. This project will explore how to use this quantum mechanical ""fabric"" of dipolar molecules to simulate properties of real materials and to study fundamental organizing principles of matter.<br/><br/>The team will construct a new apparatus to study two-dimensional quantum systems of ultracold dipolar molecules. The objectives include (1) the creation of a novel quantum gas mixture of sodium and cesium atoms. (2) The creation of dense ultracold samples of sodium-cesium molecules in the absolute ground state. (3) The investigation of molecular gases in a single two-dimensional sheet via high-resolution imaging. Sodium-cesium molecules have a large electric dipole moment (the largest among the chemically stable bialkali molecules). Utilizing the molecules' dipole moment, this team aims to explore parameter regimes that were inaccessible so far, and which may enable the observation of novel many-body quantum phases such as strongly correlated superfluidity, supersolidity, and the formation of a dipolar crystal. In addition to the technical effort, the project is accompanied by a broad outreach program that aims to improve literacy in quantum physics among high school students, undergraduate students, and high school science teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the nature of gravity at microscopic distances is one of the most important open problems in fundamental physics. Although General Relativity provides an extremely well-tested framework for describing gravitational effects at large distances, it cannot be consistently combined with the Standard Model of particle physics to provide a description of gravity at small scales. The development of a quantum theory of gravity that can be incorporated into the Standard Model is a central goal of fundamental physics, with broad implications for our understanding of particle physics and the mysterious nature of the ""dark energy"" that appears to permeate the universe. Many theories attempting to provide a consistent microscopic framework for gravity (e.g., those involving extra dimensions) predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law at distances shorter than a mm. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitational interactions at microscopic distances. The studies described here attempt to gain insights into the realm of microscopic gravitational forces with a novel experimental setup. Additionally, the research will enhance the training of students in STEM areas which are vital for the future of the nation.<br/><br/><br/>Previous measurements at these distance scales have employed techniques derived from human-size devices in which mechanical springs are used as force sensors. This group has developed a drastically new technique, using the light field of a laser to confine and measure the motion of micron (or, eventually, submicron)-size quartz microsphere.  Previous studies undertaken by this group include the most sensitive search to date for fractional charges over 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the charge of an electron. This is a by-product of having to discharge the microspheres and check that they are really neutral. The group has completed the construction of a new trap in which the entire microsphere position readout is carried out interferometrically.  This is a first in this area of research and will be applicable to other areas, e.g. biology or polymer science. The studies supported by this grant include exploring the possibility of spinning the microspheres, something that could reduce the background of the gravity measurements and may also lead to the development of nanogyroscopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultracold plasmas are a novel state of matter because the low temperature causes constituent particles, electrons and ions, to be strongly coupled. This medium has fundamentally different properties than traditional plasmas, analogous to the ways in which liquids differ from gases. Strongly coupled plasmas arise in several disciplines influencing energy, security and fundamental physics research. Examples include dense plasmas found in inertial confinement fusion experiments, intense laser-material interaction studies, sonoluminescing microbubbles, as well as astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs and giant planet interiors. Ultracold plasmas provide a unique window to view this physics because they can be accurately measured using lasers. This enables detailed tests of theoretical models. In addition to the theoretical research, a complimentary outreach program will introduce the public to plasma physics through an interactive ""What is Plasma"" demonstration. This will be an integral part of a larger exhibit on the history of space science at the University of Iowa (UI) to be displayed by the UI Natural History Museum, and later as a traveling exhibit in the UI Mobile Museum.<br/> <br/>Ultracold plasmas are formed by laser-induced ionization of trapped ultracold atoms, resulting in a charge-neutral mixture of cold ions and electrons. Advances provided by this project are statistical mechanical theory and molecular dynamics simulations capable of accounting for both components of the plasma. Theory and simulations in this relatively new field have focused on one-component models, treating the plasma as a single fluid. The new advances address two-component physics that will become increasingly important as experiments strive for lower temperatures. The particular processes that will be emphasized are equation of state, mutual diffusion, viscosity and energy relaxation rates. The project will focus on understanding how various microphysics processes affect macroscopic transport, including the opposite sign of electron and ion charge, the nonequilibrium nature of electrons and ions, and the dynamic dielectric response of the plasma. The results will provide insights into the fundamental physics of strongly coupled plasmas, contributing to several frontier research fields."

The knowledge gained in this project could enable more powerful x-ray generation, higher-pressure material properties experiments, more efficient nuclear fusion generation, and a better understanding of astrophysical processes.  The project will benefit society by advancing basic scientific knowledge, enabling future energy sources, and improving the national defense capabilities.  This project will also help to train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in plasma science and engineering while building stronger partnerships between academia, industry, and national laboratories.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the way in which cylindrical plasmas become unstable and break apart when they are strongly compressed by a magnetic field. Two new theoretical concepts will be tested experimentally.  The first study will investigate plasma instability when the plasma source is a cylindrical metal foil that has been vaporized and ionized by an intense pulse of electrical current.  The goal of this study is to determine how the instability is affected by the material properties of the metal foil.  Experiments will be conducted with various foil materials, and the results will be compared to predictions from a recently developed theory.  The second study will investigate the effect of rotating the direction of the magnetic field lines as the plasma is compressed.  A recently published theory predicts that the cumulative instability growth should be reduced by one to two orders of magnitude.  Experiments will be conducted to test this theory."

These waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and were first predicted by Einstein a century ago. The waves that LIGO detected were the result of a cataclysmic collision of two black holes, each 30 times more massive than our own Sun, crashing into each other at half the speed of light. This detection of gravitational waves has opened up an entirely new way for us to explore our Universe. We will learn about the very first stars in the Universe, how elements such as gold were made in the Universe, and we will also test Einstein's theory of gravity (a fundamental pillar of physics). This project is to help develop this entirely new field of gravitational-wave astrophysics, and to explore what LIGO will teach us about astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The first major theme of this project is LIGO Astrophysics. In the near future interesting LIGO constraints will arise from statistical analyses rather than individual events. For example, we can anticipate three general astrophysical quantities of interest: 1. the rate of mergers of compact binary systems, 2. the mass and mass ratio distributions of these mergers, and 3. the spin distributions of the component systems. The PI will help produce these distributions and the attendant science. This work is at the heart of the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. In addition to this core work, the PI will engage in a number of related projects, including the modeling of spins in hierarchical formation channels, the use of Gaussian Process Emulators to model waveforms from compact binary coalescence, the role of systematic errors in LIGO astrophysics, and LIGO's ability to constrain electromagnetically charged black holes. The second major theme of the project is Multi-Messenger Astronomy, which focuses on the next gravitational-wave revolution: identifying electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave sources. This will shed light on the underlying astrophysical processes and elucidate the formation channels of these gravitational-wave events. In addition, multi-messenger astronomy offers the potential to use gravitational-wave sources as standard candles to constrain cosmology. The PI plans the development of tools and pipelines to hasten the arrival of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy, including facilitating electromagnetic follow-up efforts through the continuing refinement and implementation of low-latency 3D localization algorithms and the optimization of follow-up resource allocation. This project will help LIGO reach its tremendous potential as an astronomical observatory."

Topology and symmetry not only play an important role in arts and product designs, but they are also fundamental in determining the behaviors of the microscopic world. Even though such effects are largely elusive to the naked eye, certain aspects of their intriguing properties can be discerned using common optical devices, such as a laser not much more complicated than a price scanner. This project targets a major breakthrough in our understanding of how energy generation and dissipation, ubiquitous in optics and related fields, impact the physical rules governed by topology and symmetry. The outcome of this investigation is expected to advance our fundamental understanding in optics and physics, as well as in materials science and optoelectronics. By employing different paradigms to realize novel states enabled by topology and symmetry, optics and photonics can provide unique platforms beyond what nature has to offer and lead to technology innovations that have vital, real-world consequences. The success of the project may underpin a new generation of sophisticated photonic devices for optical communications and computing, which have far-reaching impacts on our daily lives and the whole society. This project aligns with the National Photonics Initiative, which aims at positioning the nation as a leader in next-generation photonics technologies; it is also an integral part of the strategic plan at the researcher's institute to promote cutting-edge research in photonics and other transformative areas.  Leveraging the resources from the City University of New York, the largest urban university system in the US, the researcher will work closely with multiple outreach units to increase the awareness and interest of K-12 students in modern optics and photonics across New York City. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide an excellent research opportunity for graduate, undergraduate, and advanced high-school students, and the research will actively recruit and mentor students especially from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This project explores the emerging juncture of two of the most energized fields in physics, namely topological phases of matter and non-Hermitian photonics based on novel symmetries. Built on the success of identifying the topological origin of the integer quantum Hall effect, the prediction and observation of topological insulators have created great excitement and put the study of topological phases of matter in the spotlight of modern physics. At the same time, the extension of quantum mechanics into the non-Hermitian regime using parity-time symmetry and its subsequent realization in photonics have led to an explosion of activities, exploring spontaneous symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian photonics and the counterintuitive phenomena they bring. Although there are promising findings combining these two exciting fields, it remains unclear how the complex-valued band structure of a non-Hermitian system is related to its edge states and to what extent the latter are protected by topology and symmetry. This project will tackle these important and other related questions through the following three aims: to investigate unusual topological edge states in non-Hermitian photonic media, focusing on their exotic localization properties and a new type of non-Hermitian Dirac and Weyl points; to examine a novel non-Hermitian symmetry termed complex mirror symmetry and its implication on high-order non-Hermitian degeneracies; and to probe the properties of symmetry-protected photonic zero-mode lasers using both semiclassical and quantum optical tools. Thanks to the flexible control of optical gain and loss, different paradigms towards building topological phases of matter in optics and photonics can be realized in non-Hermitian media, which not only enrich fundamental optical physics but also lead to unprecedented photonic devices with unique optical functionalities.<br/><br/>The Physics Division and The Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first of these is the existence of a relatively light so-called Higgs boson, as discovered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012.   The biggest mystery here is to explain the origin of the mass of this new particle.   The second fundamental problem is to understand the nature and origin of the so-called ""dark matter"" that is five times more prevalent throughout the universe than ordinary matter. One possibility is that dark matter can arise together with a completely new sector of dark particles which have not been discovered by experiments conducted thus far because such particles are presumed to interact only very weakly with the known particles.  As part of her proposed research, Professor Gori will pursue an ambitious research program focused on studying these two fundamental problems at the interface between high-energy and high-intensity experiments. She will explore new models with more than one Higgs boson and investigate extended dark-sector theories.   As part of her work, she will also develop new search strategies for existing and planned experiments at Fermilab and extend its science mission with searches for dark particles.  As such, Professor Gori's research furthers the national interest by advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and potentially enhancing the research done at one of the premier US national laboratories. Professor Gori will also initiate an outreach program aimed at underrepresented minorities (URMs), connecting the University of Cincinnati Physics Department with local high schools and elementary schools whose student populations are majority female or African-American.  In particular, she will start a ""Women in STEM: From High School to Academia"" program, and she will broaden the after-school programs of local schools with predominantly URM student bodies. <br/> <br/>More technically, Professor Gori will build new models of extended sectors responsible for quark and lepton masses, and explore the signatures of such models at both low- and high-energy experiments, focusing on the connection between Higgs and flavor physics. Professor Gori will develop new search strategies for light dark sectors at existing and planned experiments at Fermilab: MINOS+, NOvA and the DUNE near detectors, and the SeaQuest nuclear physics experiment. This will allow searches for a vast set of dark-sector theories. Professor Gori will also work closely with the experimental collaborations to explore optimized setups for DUNE and SeaQuest to maximize their physics reach. Professor Gori will also exploit the connection between the Higgs and dark sectors in order to develop scenarios in which dark-sector particles are produced from Higgs decays, leading to novel signatures that can investigated over the coming years at the LHC."

The new high-resolution spectroscopy allows the researchers to peer more deeply into the structure of atoms and direct their behavior at a much finer scale. The measurements made possible by ponderomotive spectroscopy could thus lead to advances in fundamental physics and promote the progress of science. In their research, the scientists use Rydberg atoms--giant atoms that exhibit not only greater size, but also stronger interactions than usual atoms. Rydberg atoms enable the new method of ponderomotive spectroscopy. In addition, they allow for the detection of small electromagnetic fields, which may improve our ability to measure natural or human activity, as well as investigate how systems of quantum-mechanical matter (matter that behaves like waves) interact with each other.<br/><br/>In detail, the researchers employ a spectroscopic method in which highly excited Rydberg atoms are prepared in a modulated optical-lattice laser trap. Laser-cooled ground-state atoms are excited into Rydberg levels within the optical lattice. The lattice field holds on to the tenuously bound Rydberg electron via the ponderomotive light-electron interaction, which in turn results in a trapping force for the entire atom.  Time-dependent microwave modulation of the trapping field then drives transitions between Rydberg-atom levels whose energies are separated by odd harmonics of the modulation frequency. The frequency-resolution and accuracy limits of lattice modulation spectroscopy are explored. The method is employed to measure atomic quantities, such as quantum defects, ionic polarizabilities and the Rydberg constant. Using a cavity-generated, very deep implementation of the Rydberg-atom lattice, the energies of strongly mixed Rydberg adiabatic states are measured. Other measurement objectives are the polarizabilities of low-lying atomic levels and light propagation in the densely filled cold-atom channels present in the cavity-generated optical lattice. In a second research component, the trajectories of Rydberg-atom pairs are measured using a direct atom imaging technique, which is based on Rydberg-atom field ionization, ion extraction and spatial imaging. The trajectory measurements reveal interatomic forces and their anisotropy.

This new property, called an electric dipole moment, can be described as a slight bulge on an otherwise perfect sphere of charge. This seemingly abstruse property may hold the key to one of the most fundamental mysteries of nature: why is everything in the universe made of matter rather than of antimatter?  In accelerator laboratories, whenever energy is converted into particles (according to E=mc2), equal numbers of matter particles and antimatter particles are created. For example, the electron has a counterpart antimatter particle, the anti-electron, which has identical mass but opposite electric charge.  Energy can be converted into an electron/anti-electron pair, and conversely an electron and anti-electron can annihilate each other and turn into energy. Just after the Big Bang, energy was converted into particles and anti-particles. Astronomical observations show that since then, essentially all the antimatter annihilated with matter--but a tiny bit of matter was left over.  That small excess makes up all of the objects seen in the Universe today. The current framework that describes all known fundamental forces between elementary particles, known as the ""Standard Model"", cannot explain how this excess of matter survived. However, many mathematical theories have been devised that can explain this ""matter-antimatter asymmetry"", by positing new forces and particles not yet discovered in any experiment. These same new forces and particles also often lead, according to the same theories, to an electric dipole moment that is large enough to observe in the experiment supported here.  Hence, this project is essentially seeking an answer to the question: how is it that matter was slightly preferred over anti-matter at some time in the past, resulting in the physical Universe seen today? In a general sense, this project also advances the range of techniques for precision measurement science, which in the past has led to unexpected breakthroughs in technology such as GPS (the Global Positioning System), new types of sensors, etc. <br/><br/>     The electric dipole moment (EDM), if it exists, must lie along the spin axis of the electron. In the presence of a nonzero EDM, an electric field will induce a torque on the electron, resulting in precession of the spin about the field. This spin precession angle is the experimental signal. The huge internal electric field of a polar molecule, ThO, is used to amplify this observable effect. The internal structure of ThO also suppresses possible systematic errors. A cryogenic molecular beam source that delivers an unprecedented high flux of molecules is used. Lasers and optical techniques put the ThO molecules in usable coherent superpositions and then probe the quantum interference that signals the electron's spin precession. Over the previous grant period, an initial version of these methods was used to make by far the most sensitive measurement of the electron's EDM. This result was consistent with a zero value for the EDM, but many theories of what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics predict that, with improved sensitivity, detection of the EDM is likely. In this project, methods to greatly improve the sensitivity of the experiment will be introduced; these include focusing of the molecular beam and a use of a more efficient process for state preparation, based on adiabatic passage.  Improvements such as the use of low-absorption optical elements will reduce systematic errors observed in the previous experiment."

Furthermore, Professors Freitas and Leibovich will investigate the phenomenological implications of various types of dark-matter models, with particular attention to scenarios that will be extremely difficult to probe in most search experiments.  To constrain these models, it is therefore crucial to combine laboratory searches with constraints from astrophysics and cosmology.  As such, research in this area advances the national interest by fostering the development of basic science within the United States and expanding our knowledge of fundamental physical laws.  This project will also involve educating several PhD students and a postdoctoral researcher in cutting-edge calculational and analysis tools.  Professors Freitas and Leibovich also plan to work closely with astrophysicists and high-energy experimentalists to develop new search and analysis strategies that will aid in the search for new physics and improve the precision and theoretical robustness of our present understanding.

The topics range from understanding the signals observed by gravitational wave detectors such as NSF's Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the European Virgo, to studying the nature of black holes and the origin of the Universe. As with the past research supported by ongoing NSF grants, these results are likely to feature as highlights in interdisciplinary conferences, enhancing communication between diverse communities. Research funded by this grant will also add to human resources in STEM disciplines since post-docs and students will acquire diverse skills, including advanced computational and modeling techniques.<br/><br/>Research  supported  by this grant will cover the following main themes: (i) Gravitational waves. Recent discoveries at LIGO have opened a brand new window on the universe.  The first set of projects in the proposed research will lay down foundations for production and propagation of gravitational waves in the realistic context of the accelerating universe with dark energy, which we inhabit. (ii) A second set of projects will focus on quantum mechanical properties of black holes. In the classical world of general relativity, black holes are sinks of matter, energy and information. But they evaporate through emission of quantum radiation. There is a general agreement that energy is conserved in this process but there has been an ongoing debate on whether information is still lost, or if it is fully encoded in the quantum radiation that is emitted. Previous work supported by this ongoing NSF grant strongly suggests that quantum gravity effects will  remove the `singularity' at the center of the black hole, thereby clearing the way for information --that appeared to be lost there-- to come out.  Details of this process will be worked out. (iii) The third project involves the very early universe. In the currently accepted cosmological paradigms, quantum physics is indispensable in the very early phase of the universe, and yet, soon thereafter it is customary to assume that the universe behaves classically, as in general relativity.  How this classical behavior can emerge, and why all the subtleties and intricacies of quantum physics can be ignored, are issues of great interest both for foundational reasons and for bridging theory with observations. They will be addressed using a combination of methods from quantum field theory in curved space-times, equations governing dynamics of the early universe and geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. (iv) All three projects discussed above are of deep interest to researchers working at the interface of philosophy and frontiers of physical science, particularly general relativity, cosmology and quantum physics.  The results will be discussed at conferences and workshops in these fields, and serve to train young scientists and philosophers in both disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example is super-radiance, where an ensemble of atoms collectively interacts with a specific light field. While recognized long ago, this topic has gained importance over the last few years. Many areas of fundamental research, such as quantum information science, and of applications, such as the construction of accurate atomic clocks, now utilize collective properties of dense ensembles. Density effects can be detrimental. Increasing the interaction strength between atoms can destroy the coherent response of the atoms to external stimuli, which is necessary for quantum computers or precise clocks. The goal of this project is to (i) find and understand density-dependent collective effects and their consequences, (ii) to investigate methods to either mitigate or isolate the effects in a way to improve experimental control of the ensembles, and (iii) to research the various ways in which such effects can enable new technologies. <br/><br/>Basic questions will be studied regarding collective effects in cooperative media, such as: Do super-radiant effects depend on density or optical depth? What exactly is the role of the exchange interaction? What makes driven cooperative systems special? Is super-radiance fully described by pairwise correlations, and for which systems are other approximations needed? In order to achieve these goals, new analytical and numerical methods will be developed. In addition, the particular effects that will be investigated in this project include induced and spontaneous collective line shifts, spin and light field ""squeezing"" and entanglement. In addition, statistics and nonlinearities of the dynamic Casimir effect will be compared to the collective effects of super-radiant systems.

This work will be done in an ""ultracold gas"" of atoms that are cooled so that they move slowly like the atoms in a solid, but are at low density. Collections of these atoms are transparent and can be probed and controlled with lasers. If the outer electrons in these atoms are excited to high energy levels, then the atoms can exchange energy in ways that are similar to other quantum systems. Using a combination of simulation and experimental imaging techniques, the transport of energy will be measured. In this way, the project aims to create and study atomic systems that will yield insight into both fundamental quantum mechanics and the behavior of materials. The second goal of this project concerns a widely used experimental technique in which the energy level of an electron is measured by using a rapidly increasing electric field to rip off, or ionize, the outermost electron from the atom. The stripped electron is accelerated to a detector and the resulting signal is characteristic of the electron's original energy level. However, the ionization process is complex and nearby energy levels produce signals which are indistinguishable.

Building upon earlier work implementing ""state selective field ionization"" with two parallel cylinders of atoms excited to two different Rydberg states, other geometries and state distributions will be explored. As the electron's amplitude traverses the many avoided crossings on the way to ionization it splits due to Landau-Zener transitions and spreads throughout many Stark levels, complicating the identification of the original electronic energy level. Previous attempts at manipulating the electron's path to ionization have focused on coarsely determining the slope of the electric field ramp. Since there are hundreds of avoided crossings on the way to ionization, a genetic algorithm will be used to design the electric field ramp.

These tumors release immunosuppressive molecules and act as a physical barrier causing reduced immune cell infiltration and activation. Recently it was shown that large doses of Vitamin D result in reduced immunosuppression and increased immune cell infiltration in tumors, setting the stage for an effective immune cell attack on pancreatic cancer.

The project will focus on quantifying the poorly understood immune environment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. T cell receptor sequence repertoires, the cancer exome, and RNA expression will be obtained from tumor tissue of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus a high dose vitamin D. Whether the T cells infiltrating patient tumors represent unique or oligoclonal cell populations will be determined. Parallel studies will systematically assess cytokine expression and the expression of checkpoint proteins, as well as the presence of immunoregulatory cell populations.

The hypothesized forces could violate some fundamental symmetries such as Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), or Time reversal (T) symmetry in order to explain the matter to anti-matter asymmetry in the universe.  But these same forces would cause other ""forbidden"" interactions between electrons, nucleons and electromagnetic fields, which may be detected by sensitive laboratory experiments.  These effects are significantly amplified in polar molecules due to their very large internal electromagnetic fields.

The development of string theory, and more recently the discovery of certain connections between gravitational theories and non-gravitational theories, has provided us with a concrete framework and a new set of tools to address such issues.  As a result, we have uncovered deep connections between some of the most well-known problems in fundamental physics --- from the microscopic ingredients of black holes to the fundamental structure of matter --- that would otherwise be intractable. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop a more complete understanding of the microscopic nature of spacetime, by exploring the extent to which gravity emerges from quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom.  This research will also utilize novel recent techniques in order to shed light on the behavior of quantum systems that are strongly interacting. Progress in these directions will lead to insights into outstanding fundamental questions such as the structure of spacetime, the beginning and early evolution of the universe, and the physics of black holes. It will also have potential long-term applications to technology and industry as well as fundamental science, thereby advancing the national interest in all of these areas. This work will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Cremonini will involve graduate students and postdocs in her research, thus providing critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  She also plans to give public lectures on topics related to her research, and incorporate the results of her work and exciting new advances in the field into the development of new courses.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, Cremonini will examine the extent to which the main features of holography are generic and robust, by studying the conditions for the emergence of a microscopic (quantum field theoretic) description for broad classes of gravitational solutions. The focus will be on determining to what extent the internal structure of a gravitational system is affected by its symmetries and geometrical properties. A crucial aspect of this work will be the development of a systematic procedure for understanding and encoding the breaking of various symmetries in gravitational spacetimes. Moreover, part of the research will involve setups that describe the onset of instabilities and can therefore be used to model a number of quantum systems which undergo phase transitions. Using the techniques of holography, Cremonini will examine the question of the reorganization of degrees of freedom as a function of energy scale in generic quantum theories. Her research will contribute to the development of a general classification of transitions in the phase diagram of non-abelian gauge theories."

Pion-pion, kaon-pion, and nucleon-pion scattering phase shifts will be computed and used to determine the decay widths of various resonances, such as the rho meson and the Roper and Lambda(1405) resonances.  A new methodology for dealing with multi-hadron operators, known as the stochastic LapH method, will be used for these calculations. The newly discovered XYZ mesons, whose constituents are believed to consist of a heavy quark and antiquark plus a light quark and antiquark, will be studied using both conventional lattice QCD techniques and using a Born-Oppenheimer treatment."

Understanding how such order arises is a central pursuit of science. A great deal of this effort now focuses on the behavior of electrons and atoms at temperatures near absolute zero, where weak interactions can dominate and new states of matter emerge. These new states are often exotic and unexpected, such as magnetic states that are characterized by specific alignments of particles, or super fluids that flow through tiny constrictions with no resistance because of a long-range synchronicity of particle motion within a fluid. Such phenomena are originally investigated for fundamental interest that satisfies a human drive to understand the world in which we live, but they often lead to technological advances such as computer hard-drives or superconductivity. The particular project funded by this grant aims to improve our fundamental understanding of how order arises to produce magnetism. At a microscopic level, a magnet sticks to a refrigerator because a significant fraction of the electrons in the magnet are spinning or rotating in the same direction. To understand magnetism, one needs to understand why the electrons orient themselves, and what types of correlated motions they display. Because these phenomena involve many interacting particles, a full understanding of this problem has eluded us so far. This group is developing new methods to understand problems like this. A powerful trend in physics research today is to use ultracold atoms as analogs for electrons in solids in order to study magnetism. Atomic gases are much easier to study than solids because they can be prepared without any impurities and the atom-atom interactions can be tuned, for example. In the work funded by this award, atoms will be confined in a corrugated cage of light, analogous to an egg crate.  By simultaneously using multiple lasers which emit light of different colors, the geometric details of the ""egg crate"" can be smoothly morphed into a variety of patterns, changing the shapes of the pockets into which the atoms are nestled, and even merging several pockets into one larger pocket, for example.  This allows the scientists involved in this work to explore the richness of theories that have been developed to understand real solid materials, such as the ""Fermi-Hubbard model.""  It is possible that in atomic gases one might discover new phenomena that lead to practical applications, and this improved understanding of the behavior of interacting collections of many atoms or electrons may give us new tools for designing materials with desired properties.<br/><br/>The specific system at the heart of this project is the fermionic isotope of strontium, Sr-87, which has a nuclear spin of 9/2. This nuclear spin provides the analog of the electron spin in conventional magnetic materials, but with ten possible spin orientations rather than the conventional two for an electron. Because strontium is a closed-shell atom, interactions between Sr-87 atoms are independent of the orientation of the nucleus. This creates a huge degeneracy in the ground state of the system, which is predicted to display a rich collection of new phenomena related to the alignment and correlation of nuclear spins. The experimental plan is to study the thermodynamics of a large-spin gas in a bulk system and to probe the alignment of nuclear spins when individual atoms are confined to sites of an optical-lattice potential formed by standing waves of light."

The ulra-low electrical resistivity of a superconductor material allows a radio frequency resonator (needed for an accelerator) to obtain a high quality factor (Q) which allows energy storage with very low loss. Future accelerators, important in many areas of science and medicine, will benefit from advances such as the techniques in this award. This award is for advanced studies of superconductors used in SRF accelerators. Superconductors used in SRF are limited by the fundamental surface resistance. The next significant breakthrough in the SRF cavity technology is only possible if the physics of surface resistance is fully understood. The main goal of this research is to provide an understanding of the origin of the various contributions to the power dissipation in superconducting niobium and in particular the origin of the non-linear behavior as a function of the radio frequency field. This award includes integrated experimental and theoretical parts to address the unresolved issues of the surface resistance of superconductors at high radio frequency field, and in particular how the surface composition and structure can be modified and tuned in order to reduce surface resistance. The theoretical work will guide the experimental work which, in turn, will provide feedback to further develop the theory. This research will be performed by two graduate students and thus contribute to the education of accelerator scientists, who are in extremely short supply. The successful completion of this work will be very beneficial for the ongoing R&D of high performance SRF cavities. Addressing the outstanding problems of the residual surface resistance and the increase of the quality factor Q with the radio frequency field magnitude can help guide the ongoing R&D of SRF cavities and evaluate possibilities of promising new materials as possible SRF materials. This work will have a significant impact on the application of the SRF technology in general, and to accelerators operating in continuous wave mode in particular.<br/><br/>In this award some of the unresolved issues in our understanding of the surface resistance of superconductors will be addressed, in particular: (1) the physics of the residual resistance, which can exceed 20% of the theoretical contribution; (2) mechanisms of the observed increase of Q with the field and the possibilities of using this effect to extend the increase of Q to higher fields to boost the cavity performance; (3) possibilities of increasing the Q factor by managing impurities; and (4) making SRF materials other than Niobium useful for low field accelerator applications at low temperature."

Systems which are not in equilibrium display phenomena that ""break the rules"" that govern equilibrium phases. Such phenomena are intrinsically interesting and potentially useful for applications. Gases that have been cooled to nano-Kelvin temperatures provide an exciting new platform for the study of non-equilibrium systems. Experiments with ultracold gases flexibly manipulate and image matter using unique and precise tools provided by optics. While such experiments are rapidly advancing, new theoretical techniques are also needed to aid the investigations.  This project will develop numerical algorithms to solve a range of previously intractable, experimentally important problems. The new algorithms will be used to design experimental schemes to cool ultracold matter to even lower temperatures (a grand challenge of the field), thereby redefining the low-temperature frontier. This would realize long-sought and previously inaccessible phases of matter, including phases which simulate high-temperature superconductivity. The project will train graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the use of the new algorithms, facilitating their future use in other areas of non-equilibrium physics. In addition, publicly accessible educational materials will be developed which unify concepts in non-equilibrium dynamics that are used regularly by physicists, but which are taught only inexplicitly, if at all, in typical physics curricula. These lessons will include videos, reading, and exercises that can be used for self-study or in a classroom, and will include multiple versions, each designed for students of different levels of expertise, from non-physicists to practicing researchers.<br/><br/>This project will develop two algorithms, a dynamical numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE) and a cluster truncated Wigner approximation (cl-TWA), which potentially can accurately calculate important ultracold dynamics in minutes on a laptop for cases that are currently inaccessible to even the largest supercomputers. The algorithms achieve their accuracy by recognizing and exploiting special physical structures that underlie many ultracold dynamics experiments. The project will focus on applying these new algorithms to design and optimize new protocols for cooling ultracold matter that fall into three categories: entropy management, adiabatic preparation, and engineered dissipation. It will also partner with experiments to address fundamental questions of nonequilibrium physics, selected to align the strengths of the algorithms with emerging experimental directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main focus of the research is to address the question:  How were the heavy elements made?  The research component aims at the study of the decay properties of exotic nuclei utilizing the technique of Total Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS). Measurements will focus on nuclei along the rapid-neutron-capture process (or r-process), which is believed to be responsible for the origin of half of the heavy elements. The measurements will build on the previous experience of the PI in the development and use of a Total Absorption Spectrometer and will utilize existing equipment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory together with the implementation of new proposed equipment, in this case a tape transport system for the removal of background activity from the detection area.<br/> <br/>The technical focus of the research is through the measurement of beta-decay strength distributions of nuclei along the astrophysical r-process. The beta-decay strength distribution is the only reliable parameter for constraining the theoretical models used in r-process calculations and improving their predictive power. <br/><br/>The PI will also establish a unique, new one-week summer school for rising juniors in the area of nuclear physics.  The school will be available to 12 students each summer and provide hands-on laboratory activities as well as instruction in nuclear physics.  Students from schools that do not offer an undergraduate course in nuclear physics will benefit from this summer school. Ultimately it is important to increase the number of graduate students in the field of low-energy nuclear structure physics, which is important not only for the basic science addressed, but as a training ground for skilled workers in critical areas of homeland security."

The aim of TASI is to expose advanced graduate students to a much broader range of ideas and topics than they normally experience in their home institutions while working on their dissertation topics. TASI has been held every summer since 1984, and has been held on the Boulder campus since 1989. A nationally-distributed Scientific Advisory Board selects a topic and recruits scientific organizers, who arrange the program for that year. In a typical year about sixty junior participants hear approximately sixty presentations from approximately twenty cutting-edge established researchers. TASI is the most successful program of its kind in the world, and past students of TASI are found at major research institutions (both in and outside high-energy physics). As such, TASI advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science and the training of junior scientists. Further broader impacts associated with TASI include the TASI videos, lecture notes, and written proceedings, all of which provide the same benefits more broadly to other members of the high-energy physics community and beyond. A Public Lecture is also part of TASI's annual program, and attracts a large audience from the community. <br/><br/>Professor Thomas DeGrand of the University of Colorado at Boulder is responsible for TASI's infrastructure: he oversees annual TASI operations, maintains the web site, makes and distributes the poster, collects applications, assists in the admission process, organizes housing for junior and senior participants, takes care of the lecture venue, records the presentations, and allocates participant support costs.   This five-year grant provides support for TASI operations during the period 2018-2022, inclusive.  During this period it is expected that oversight of TASI local operations will increasingly shift towards the co-PI's Oliver de Wolfe and Ethan Neil, each of whom is also a faculty member at the University of Colorado.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are examples of collective phenomena in stirred systems, and have even been observed in the ultracold atomic gases known as Bose-Einstein condensates. Surprisingly, vortices have recently been discovered in the quantum mechanical wave function describing elementary electron-atom collision processes, where their appearance was correlated to deep minima in observed scattering cross sections. The situation is still somewhat murky, since elementary collision processes seem to have little in common with the much more complex phenomena associated with the collective properties of liquids and gases. This project hopes to shed light on this mystery by searching for vortex formation in collision processes involving positrons rather than electrons. Positrons are antiparticles of electrons, carry positive charge, and so interact very differently with matter. Sensitivity to the charge of an incident projectile will therefore be tested through direct theoretical calculations, hopefully clarifying the underlying mechanism of vortex formation in these processes. Since positrons are now commonly used in a variety of fields and applications, ranging from condensed matter physics to positron-emission tomography (PET scans), the relevance of vortex formation to elementary collision processes involving positrons could have wide-ranging impact.  The work will engage graduate students in challenging research projects involving elementary quantum mechanical collision processes.<br/><br/>Recently, researchers have demonstrated that vortex formation is responsible for deep minima observed in the experimental measurements of the triply differential cross sections for electron-impact ionization of helium atoms. Vortices have also been studied for other ionization processes in atomic collisions. The first goal of this project is to analyze vortex formation in positron-hydrogen and positron-helium collisions, to see whether or not vortices affect the rate of positronium formation. The PI will guide a graduate student through a detailed analysis of positronium formation in these processes using Kohn-type variational methods, multichannel effective range theories and the Born approximation. The goal is to determine basic components necessary to obtain a zero in the positronium formation scattering amplitude, the corresponding deep minimum in the differential cross section and the vortex in the velocity field that corresponds to the scattering amplitude. A second project is to study positronium-positronium scattering, which is of interest since it is a fundamental four-body Coulomb problem, and in support of experimental efforts to make a positronium Bose-Einstein Condensate. The PI will train a graduate student to use Kohn-type variational methods and the Born approximation with exchange for this analysis. A goal is to obtain benchmark results for ground-state positronium - ground-state positronium scattering using Kohn-type variational methods."

The present project, although itself not directly connected to treating disease, informs a potential new treatment modality that has intrinsic specificity and potentially minimal side effects. The intellectual merit of the project lies in a new paradigm that focuses on synthesizing new concepts for molecule specific interaction with nonionizing electromagnetic radiation. The project combines scientific and technical expertise from multiple disciplines, including theoretical and experimental physics, biochemistry, nanotechnology and optical spectroscopy. Five graduate students from three academic departments at two institutions will be engaged in forefront integrated science research with a common goal of obtaining proof-of-principle of the core concept which, if successful, will lead to substantial follow-on research and ultimately form the basis of the development of a new era of disease treatment.<br/><br/>This project will explore a new physics-based technique that could contribute to the treatment of various human diseases, including infectious and noninfectious disease, Alzheimer's, etc., and eventually even to treatment of cancer and aging.

The structured radiation will be highly tailored in the time and frequency domains, in the mid-infrared (IR) and far infrared / THz ranges and, to retain selectivity, will be carefully tuned into the moderately-nonlinear intensity domain. Modulation techniques will be used to overcome the field penetration problem. This project represents the first step toward this goal.

Laser cooling is capable of refrigerating vapors of atoms to fractions of a degree above absolute zero, where their behavior is governed by quantum physics. In the past three decades, scientists have used these cold atomic vapors as a scientific platform for learning about this quantum regime, and the field has given birth to applications such as atomic clocks and sensors. The chemicals that can be investigated in this way, however, are limited to only a handful by the laser colors available. Extending laser cooling to a broader array of atoms and molecules is desirable for learning about these species and how they interact at a level of detail not possible at room temperature. The research team supported by this program will be studying the application of a different type of laser to cool these difficult species. These so-called ""ultrafast"" lasers can be made to emit an entire rainbow of colors at once, and this program will study how to finesse these sources into laser cooling a wider array of atoms and molecules. Successful extension of laser cooling to these species is expected to find use in the next generation of sensors, computers, and platforms for future science.<br/><br/>Direct laser cooling and trapping using optical frequency combs has the potential to extend laser cooling to more diverse species of atoms and molecules than are currently accessible. This potential arises due to their utility in creating many optical frequencies in parallel in parts of the optical spectrum where doing this with continuous-wave lasers is impractical, such as the deep ultraviolet. The enhanced efficiency with which mode-locked lasers can drive two-photon transitions or be converted to desired wavelengths via nonlinear processes results in utilization of the full power in the comb even if only one tooth is used, making this process efficient. Specifically, researchers supported by this program will use picosecond mode-locked optical frequency combs for direct laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of atoms on two-photon transitions (rubidium, nitrogen) and single-photon laser cooling of diatomic molecules (Strontium Hydride). Time-dependent sweeps of the comb will also be investigated as a method for beam slowing and trap capture that would be applicable to a wider array of species than Zeeman slowing, such as diatomics. Development of a widely-applicable technique for cooling of molecules would have payoffs, including the ability to address significant unknowns in the fields of dipolar quantum gases, quantum simulations, controlled chemistry, and quantum computing."

Quantum theory prescribes that only very specific average distances from the nucleus are allowed.  This limitation gives rise to the specific colors of light that atoms respond to when hit with a laser beam.  By tuning the laser precisely, one can find the specific colors that are in resonance with the orbiting electron, and thereby learn about the intricate details of the internal structure of the atom.  While most atoms have many electrons, making the task of understanding the complicated pattern of orbits relatively difficult, hydrogen and helium have only one and two electrons, respectively, and hence are amenable to very precise theoretical prediction.  By comparing these very precise predictions to similarly precise measurements, one can test whether or not the theory of ""quantum electrodynamics"" (the fundamental theory of light, atoms, and most of the rest of the ordinary world around us) is really correct, or only approximately so.  The group supported by this grant plans to develop and deploy the laser sources and techniques that will allow improved tests of the quantum theory described above.  If the theory is found to be correct at the new level of accuracy, the results of the experiments can then be used to determine the size of the nucleus in hydrogen and helium.  A comparison of these sizes with what is known or predicted in nuclear physics will then provide a test of the scientific understanding of these simple nuclei.  In this way, these experiments bridge the gap between the atom and the nucleus, and test the consistency of two regimes of physics which differ in length scale by a factor of 10,000.  Laser sources and optical techniques are ubiquitous in science, technology and the economy, so training of students in this area provides valuable expertise, and has the potential to develop generally important laser sources and optical techniques for a wide range of applications.  <br/><br/><br/>This research develops laser technology and precision laser techniques.  It applies them to the study of helium fine structure and the precise determination of hydrogen and helium nuclear sizes.  Optical methods are developed which involve high-speed electro-optic modulation of a stabilized semiconductor laser, creating microwave tunable frequency side bands on the laser.  These side bands can then be used to drive and determine the transitions frequencies of the triplet 2S -> 2P in helium 3 and 4, and 1S->2S in hydrogen and its isotopes. The physics of the laser interaction with hydrogen and helium atoms is carefully studied to obtain the unperturbed frequencies of studied atomic transitions.  Results will be obtained with sufficient precision to provide important comparisons with theory.  These include (1) the atomic theory and computation of electron-electron interactions in helium, the simplest multi-electron atom, and (2) the nuclear interactions and computations that predict the observed size of few-nucleon nuclei.  In particular, isotopic shifts in these experimental results allow the charge radii of helium-3 and tritium to be determined and compared to predictions of few-nucleon theory and the underlying description of the nuclear force."

One of the LHC's recent discoveries was to find a candidate for the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts with amazing accuracy for the observed interactions of particles forming the visible matter in the universe.  The next step is to capitalize on the LHC to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) to address difficulties known to exist in the SM.  This group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment to look for decays of the Higgs particle as the LHC begins operations at twice the energy ever studied before.   The PI will continue to communicate the excitement that the Higgs discovery generated as a means of attracting students into the study of science through such activities as giving lectures on Physics at the LHC to high school students in Albany and the Honors College students at the university, organizing and holding Q&A sessions after the screening of the movie ""Particle Fever"" in local area theaters, and participating in the online ""Adopt-a-Physicist"" program run by the American Physical Society.<br/>   <br/>The LHC has completed one successful run.

This group has expertise in analysis of the properties of Higgs decays. The group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment through Run2.

This team will record ""molecular movies"" by using strong table-top laser pulses. One pulse will be used to initiate the ionization of the molecular valence electrons orbitals, and then a second pulse and an ion detection system will be used to capture the time-evolution of the transformation.

The first of these is the existence of a relatively light so-called Higgs boson, as discovered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012.   The biggest mystery here is to explain the origin of the mass of this new particle.   The second fundamental problem is to understand the nature and origin of the so-called ""dark matter"" that is five times more prevalent throughout the universe than ordinary matter. One possibility is that dark matter can arise together with a completely new sector of dark particles which have not been discovered by experiments conducted thus far because such particles are presumed to interact only very weakly with the known particles.  As part of her proposed research, Professor Gori will pursue an ambitious research program focused on studying these two fundamental problems at the interface between high-energy and high-intensity experiments. She will explore new models with more than one Higgs boson and investigate extended dark-sector theories.   As part of her work, she will also develop new search strategies for existing and planned experiments at Fermilab and extend its science mission with searches for dark particles.  As such, Professor Gori's research furthers the national interest by advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and potentially enhancing the research done at one of the premier US national laboratories. Professor Gori will also initiate an outreach program aimed at underrepresented minorities (URMs), connecting the University of Cincinnati Physics Department with local high schools and elementary schools whose student populations are majority female or African-American.  In particular, she will start a ""Women in STEM: From High School to Academia"" program, and she will broaden the after-school programs of local schools with predominantly URM student bodies. <br/> <br/>More technically, Professor Gori will build new models of extended sectors responsible for quark and lepton masses, and explore the signatures of such models at both low- and high-energy experiments, focusing on the connection between Higgs and flavor physics. Professor Gori will develop new search strategies for light dark sectors at existing and planned experiments at Fermilab: MINOS+, NOvA and the DUNE near detectors, and the SeaQuest nuclear physics experiment. This will allow searches for a vast set of dark-sector theories. Professor Gori will also work closely with the experimental collaborations to explore optimized setups for DUNE and SeaQuest to maximize their physics reach. Professor Gori will also exploit the connection between the Higgs and dark sectors in order to develop scenarios in which dark-sector particles are produced from Higgs decays, leading to novel signatures that can investigated over the coming years at the LHC."

Most of the known matter in the universe is in an ionized state, a plasma, comprised of electrons and ions that strongly interact with electromagnetic fields.  Magnetic reconnection is an explosive phenomenon that occurs in plasmas where magnetic field lines suddenly rearrange themselves to release large amounts of energy.  This has important implications here on Earth for fusion energy schemes and prediction of space weather events that can disable satellites used for communication and navigation. Magnetic reconnection is also theorized to occur around violent astrophysical events such as in the vicinity of gamma-ray bursts or active galactic nuclei where the magnetic fields are very large and the particles move at close to the speed of light.  This project will investigate magnetic reconnection under similar conditions in the laboratory and test the accuracy of existing theories. In addition, this award will support efforts to improve the climate for women and other underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines in general, and in plasma physics, in particular.<br/><br/>Relativistic magnetic reconnection occurs when the energy density of the reconnecting fields exceeds the rest mass energy density. The experiments to be performed will use laser pulses focused to ultra-high intensities to heat a small volume of electrons on a solid foil target to relativistic energies. The electrons are mostly confined to the target surface and expand radially outwards at the speed of light. This generates a very large azimuthal magnetic field. Focusing two laser pulses in close proximity forms oppositely directed magnetic fields in the midplane to form a driven reconnection geometry.  Numerical modeling has indicated the conditions created by the laser pulses will satisfy the requirement for accessing the relativistic magnetic reconnection regime. Measurements of the timescale of the reconnection and the characterization of accelerated particle jets will be used to benchmark and test existing theories and numerical models.  Further, the education and outreach goal of the project is to help address under-representation of women and minority groups within many fields of STEM, and specifically in plasma physics.  This will be done by developing curriculum to educate undergraduate students about unconscious bias and when this may lead to unintentionally discriminatory behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project focuses on the continued development and operation of new instrumentation for a detector based on liquid argon and the invention and incorporation of new analytical techniques to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which furthers the development and impact of LArTPC technology applications, using the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. This experiment will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE is in the process of making a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with its superior LArTPC detector, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The PI's Group has broader impacts aspects that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; and increased public scientific literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum control of these systems paves the way for new technologies such as quantum communication and quantum computing.  This project will pioneer the use of lanthanum ions as a quantum bit in order to overcome some challenges for quantum communication networks.  In particular, the project seeks to demonstrate an interface between ions and infrared photons. Since infrared light suffers minimal losses in an optical fiber, this approach can extend the size and efficiency of quantum communication networks. Students working on this project will benefit from atomic physics research training using lasers, optics, photonics, and fiber technology.  The project will also develop new curricula incorporating quantum information science and photonics technologies. These activities will help prepare the next generation of STEM researchers, educators, and innovators.<br/><br/>The research aim of this project is to establish doubly-ionized lanthanum as a quantum bit, or qubit, that can be controlled with telecom-compatible infrared light.  Trapped atomic ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing applications due to their long trapping times, good coherence properties, and the availability of methods to precisely control their quantum states using radiation.  However, the established ion trapping experiments use ions from elements that mainly interact with visible and ultraviolet light.  This poses a challenge for quantum networking because these wavelengths get attenuated in optical fibers.  Doubly-ionized lanthanum is unique because telecom-compatible infrared light is all that should be needed for laser cooling and qubit operations. This project will use telecom-compatible infrared light first for Doppler cooling, and then for manipulation of qubits based on magnetic-field-insensitive hyperfine states. This is expected to be advantageous for long-distance quantum communication protocols that use atom-photon entanglement and for distributed quantum computation schemes. Directly interfacing ions with infrared wavelengths will also reduce the complexity of the system, and may thus enhance the potential for scaling up larger quantum networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two components to this research. First, light scattering is used as a method to measure the properties of an atomic system. At the true quantum level, light arrives at a detector as individual photon counts. Light scattering in a model system is simulated exactly, and then simulation results will be used to develop statistical techniques to extract information about the system even if there are only a few isolated photon counts. In a related issue, to enable full transfer of quantum mechanical information between light and a collection of atoms, the atomic sample should ideally be dense and cold. Massive numerical simulations of light propagation in a cold dense gas have shown that the current understanding of such systems is flawed. New principles will be formulated that govern this case. This work is pure basic research, and the final aim is to help build the science basis for future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>A Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential is used as a generic example to study light scattering from a material sample. The light is assumed to be monitored using detectors capable of single-photon resolution. The quantum mechanics of the joint light-matter-detector system is solved exactly using quantum trajectory simulations. A Bayesian inference is developed as a method to extract the maximum possible amount of information about the atoms from the observed photon counts. The immediate aim is to devise repeated and correlated photon counting measurements for monitoring and feedback control of quantum systems. More generally, light scattering is the method to monitor not only double-well condensates, but also probably the majority of atomic systems under continuous observation. To reach a resolution at the level of a single quantum, the sample has to be optically thick. The potentially high densities and the low temperatures beneficial for quantum coherence will bring in the possibility of cooperative response of the atoms to light. Cooperative light-atom interaction using classical-electrodynamics simulations of light propagation in a medium of point dipoles will be studied. The objective is to find out how the cooperative response alters the results of light scattering experiments."

Gravitational waves come from Einstein's theory of gravity, and are one of the few specific predictions of Einstein's theory that can be experimentally checked against other theories of gravity (like Isaac Newton's).  Determining if Einstein's, Newton's, or perhaps some other theory of gravity correctly describes our universe is necessary to developing a complete understanding of the laws of nature.  This experiment is being performed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) with two large, four kilometer long detectors in Louisiana and Washington state.  Once gravitational waves are detected by LIGO, these detections will serve as another method of studying the universe, complementary but different from optical, radio, and other conventional telescopes.  With gravitational wave detections, we expect to learn more about black holes, neutron stars, supernova, the origins of the universe, and other high energy astronomical events.  Unfortunately, the effect of gravitational waves on the LIGO detectors is very small, and noise from other phenomenon can easily overwhelm the gravitational signal.  This grant supports work to better understand and reduce coating thermal noise, a critical noise source that limits our ability to detect gravitational waves.  The related education and outreach project is to pass on the excitement about optics we develop working on LIGO to high school students through a fun and educational competition, the Optics Olympiad.  In addition to individuals and teams competing on knowledge and understanding of optics, there will be panel discussions, a guest lecturer, and tours of science laboratories at American University.<br/><br/>Thermal noise in the coatings of the LIGO optics is caused by mechanical loss, as shown by the Fluctuation Dissipation theorem.  We will reduce this thermal noise by developing Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) crystals and silicon nitride for use as LIGO coatings.  AlGaAs has already shown lower thermal noise in other precision optics experiments under different conditions.  Preliminary results with AlGaAs under LIGO conditions indicate some improvement in mechanical loss compared to current coatings, but not as much as expected.  This may be due to surface conditions on the substrate, which will be explored using various chemical and mechanical surface treatments.  The effects of these treatments on AlGaAs mechanical loss will be explored using normal mode quality factor, or Q, measurements.  We will also better characterize and understand thermal noise from AlGaAs using the complete description of mechanical loss as the imaginary part of the stiffness tensor.  This may allow for ways to improve thermal noise through the layer design of the coating beyond improvements from better materials.  The Optic Olympiad will include a formative assessment to determine what elements of the Olympiad are helping to reach the goals of increasing students understanding of physics and optics as well as improving their impression of STEM careers.  Results of this assessment and the Olympiad in general will be presented to the physics education research community, likely as a journal article or conference presentation."

Identifying the nature of dark matter is a central goal of fundamental physics in the coming years. This award provides support to develop a novel set of techniques to search for dark matter by observing the possible presence of new forces under which dark matter interacts. If present, these new forces could lead to small, but observable, deviations in the electromagnetic interactions of normal matter. The techniques planned here will enable novel searches for dark matter that are largely complementary to existing searches. These searches will provide more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to a well-motivated class of dark matter models, relative to the best existing laboratory constraints. Since no single search can probe all viable dark matter models, a wide variety of complementary techniques will likely be needed to identify the nature of dark matter or fully constrain its properties.<br/><br/>This award will provide educational opportunities related to the scientific and technical aspects of this research to the New Haven and Yale University communities. In particular, the Pathways to Science program serves the local school districts in New Haven and reflects the diversity of the public schools in this area. Through the activities supported by this award, middle and high school students from groups that are underrepresented in physics and STEM-based fields will have the opportunity to learn about the physics and techniques underlying this research. <br/><br/>A new class of force sensors based on optically levitated dielectric microspheres in high vacuum will be used to search for the effects of such new forces. These techniques can allow the detection of Newtonian forces smaller than 10^-18 N acting on nanogram-sized objects. An experimental apparatus optimized for searches for deviations from Coulomb's law at sub-mm distances will be developed in the course of this work, which will enable a search for new interactions mediated by dark photons with masses between 0.1 meV and 1 eV. In addition, the same force sensors can be used to search for ""milli-charged particles,"" which have tiny fractional electric charges (q << 1 e). In certain dark matter models, such particles could have been produced in the early universe and formed stable bound states with atoms that can be searched for in terrestrial matter today."

As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  As part of his funded research, Professor Pufu will develop theoretical tools for understanding how the short-distance physics affects and constrains the long-distance physics in such systems.

In specific, this project seeks to produce and use ""soft x-ray"" light that will travel between 3 and 4 billionths of a meter during each oscillation of the light (wavelengths 3.4 and 4.0 nm).  These wavelengths fall in the so-called ""water window"" (2.3-4.4 nm) in which water is transparent, but many other parts of cells are not.  Using light with these wavelengths allows one to see through the water inside cells to clearly visualize the functional parts of the cells in high resolution.  The key enabling tool is called an X-ray laser (XRL), and this project seeks to produce one that is sufficiently small and affordable that it can be put into widespread use to image live biological cells in their natural environment.  The work is based on the use of highly charged ions, atoms which have most of their electrons removed.  Included in this project is the goal of demonstrating the utility of the new XRL by imaging natural cell membranes.  This work is co-funded by the NSF Office of Integrative Activities, the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Experimental Physics Program, the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering, the Instrument Development for Biological Research Program, and the Emerging Frontiers Office of the Biology Directorate.<br/><br/>Recently, high gain was demonstrated for the first time in a recombination X-ray laser at 4.0nm This result stimulated a new idea to efficiently generate attosecond pulses by utilizing an XRL at 4.0 nm in combination with an infrared (IR) field directly in the inverted media of a recombination XRL. This idea was developed theoretically at Texas A&M University (TAMU) based on quantum optics and is proposed here to test this idea experimentally at Princeton as part of this INSPIRE project. It is expected that the practical application of an XRL for biological imaging requires the laser pulses to have an energy of 2 - 4 micro-Joules of energy per pulse. Therefore the crucial issue for this project will be the search for large XRL beam intensity amplification. The natural extension of this search will be the generation of high XRL beam intensity at another water window wavelength, in this case 3.4nm. By using a Schwarzschild multilayer coated objective and a high sensitivity two dimensional charge-coupled device detector, the cell radiation exposure will be kept low to allow the imaging of live cells."

Scientists have long understood how light interacts with bulk matter: for example, it can reflect off surfaces and bend when it enters glass.  More recently, scientists have begun to explore the extremes of light-matter interaction.  What happens when a single photon (particle of light) interacts with a single atom?  The atom can either absorb or emit one photon, but if it is placed between two mirrors, it can absorb and re-emit the same photon many times.  When this happens, the atom and photon form a new collective system, like a molecule between the atom and the photon.  In this case, the interaction is said to be strong.  In this project, the goal is to explore what happens when the interaction becomes still stronger, and more photons become involved.  In particular, scientists have predicted that light itself will undergo a phase transition (like when water turns into ice).  Here, patterned metal circuits, like those in a computer chip, will be used to study the interaction between microwave photons and artificial atoms.  In particular, the chief aim is to observe a phase transition for these microwave photons and to study the new properties of light that emerge.  This will give insight into how interactions lead to complex new behavior, a theme that runs throughout much of science and technology.  Moreover, the specific circuits that will be used to study this are also used for building a new type of computer called a quantum computer; improvement in these circuits is an ancillary benefit.<br/> <br/>The specific aim of this proposal is to study the emergence of many-body states of light in systems of interacting photons.  Effective photon-photon interactions will be generated using superconducting microwave circuits, with effective interactions mediated by Josephson-junction qubits.  Two different architectures will be used to study these phase transitions.  First, arrays of microwave cavities, each coupled to a superconducting qubit, will be used to generate a lattice of interacting microwave photons.  The lattice will be populated with a steady state drive and dissipation, which, under appropriate conditions, will lead to a steady-state, non-equilibrium phase transition.  The nature of this phase transition and of the steady states will be explored.  Second, superconducting qubits will be placed in a photonic bandgap medium.  These qubits will result in the generation of bound single photon states; multiple qubits will result in overlapping bound photons, generating a highly tunable lattice to study these many-body quantum optics effects.  This project provides a complementary approach to studying phase transitions with cold atoms, and can easily access non-equilibrium physics and transport properties of the system."

One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon.  Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging.  This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."

Einstein's theory predicts that the most compact possible objects are black holes, whose gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape;  remarkably, such black holes appear to be abundantly present in the universe.  Another salient prediction of Einstein's theory, gravitational waves (small ""ripples"" in the fabric of space-time), were observationally confirmed over the past year.   However, a reconciliation between Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics has evaded a complete solution for many years.  Recently it has been shown that certain quantum theories of gravity may be described by more conventional quantum-mechanical systems. This identification can teach us a great deal about the quantum behavior of black holes and about the evolution of the universe as a whole, thereby extending scientific knowledge at its most fundamental level.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  One of the goals of the research funded under this grant is to gain more thorough insight into the remarkable relation between Einstein's gravity and quantum-mechanical systems, and to use it to describe black holes and cosmology.

A significant component of this research will explore quantum field theories which have conformal symmetry.  Such theories describe certain second-order phase transitions.  Via the gauge/gravity duality, conformal field theories are related to quantum gravity in negatively curved anti-de Sitter space.  Conformal field theories in more than two dimensions will be studied using the methods of dimensional continuation and 1/N expansion.  New information concerning quantum entanglement entropy in conformal field theories will be extracted.  Studies of conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions and nearly-conformal quantum mechanics can teach us a great deal about low-dimensional models of quantum gravity and the properties of black holes."

Energy conversion involves changes in the structure of the molecule, which plays a critical role in biological processes such as photosynthesis, vision, and the damage of cells due to absorption of ultraviolet light. From a technological standpoint, the conversion of light into chemical energy and heat at the molecular scale is important for solar energy conversion and storage. When a molecule absorbs a particle of light, it's structure is often significantly changed, but these changes are difficult to observe because of the very small scale and the rapid pace with which the structure changes. Visualizing the molecular structure and how it changes will improve our understanding of how energy is transformed. In this project, the investigators will develop the tools to capture three-dimensional images of isolated molecules with atomic resolution. These methods can then be applied to observe how structures change in time. In order to capture images, the orientation of the molecules will be controlled using very short laser pulses with a duration of less than 1 trillionth of a second. Similarly short electron pulses will be scattered from the molecules, and the structures will be retrieved by analyzing the scattering patterns. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to capture three dimensional images of isolated molecules with atomic resolution. Experiments will start with small molecules and then continue with more complex molecules such as Trifluorotoluene, Stilbene and Diiodotetrafluoroethane. The molecules will be imaged in a cooled gas beam in vacuum. A femtosecond laser pulse will be used to impulsively align the molecules, and a femtosecond or picosecond electron pulse will be used to capture a diffraction pattern of the molecules while they are aligned. The advantage of impulsively aligning the molecules with femtosecond pulses is that the maximum alignment is reached a few picosecond after the interaction with the laser, thus the molecules can be probed in a field-free environment.  First, the effect of the laser pulse on the angular distribution and structure of the molecules will be investigated as a function of laser intensity, to determine the optimal alignment parameters such that the alignment is maximized without distorting the structure. Changes in the structure caused by the laser can be detected as changes in the diffraction pattern. Multiple diffraction patterns will be captured for different orientations of the molecules with respect to the detector. Finally, the structure will be retrieved from the diffraction patterns by combining the information in multiple diffraction patterns and using phase retrieval algorithms. If successful, the project will result in a significant advancement in our capability to capture images of isolated molecules."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award is to support the NSF-funded DarkSide (DS) groups for the construction and operation of DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), a direct WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 tons (20 tons).<br/><br/>The LAr TPC relies heavily on the utilization of argon obtained from underground sources, or UAr. The planned Aria project for UAr purification may improve the worldwide availability of valuable stable rare isotopes such as O-18, N-15, and C-13, used for various medical, industrial and energy generation applications. The production of hundreds of tonnes of low-radioactivity UAr for DS-20k and for other technical uses requiring detection of Ar-37 for nuclear test ban verification, and Ar-39, for radiometric dating. Special E&O programs are planned with focus on educating K-12 teachers about basic physics and how it relates to dark matter detection, re-starting a summer school experience for high-school and undergraduate students, as well giving research opportunities to undergraduate students at participating underrepresented-minority serving institutions.<br/><br/>DS-20k builds on the success of DarkSide-50 (DS-50), operating at LNGS since 2013, which produced two zero-background science results using atmospheric argon (AAr) and then underground argon (UAr) fills. DS-50 demonstrated an 39Ar reduction of 1400 in the UAr. Electron recoil (ER) background was shown to be completely suppressed in the region of interest, with discrimination better than 1 part in 1.5 x 10^7. These results demonstrated the ability of large LAr TPCs to operate in an ""instrumental background-free mode"" - a mode in which less than <0.1 events (other than actual nuclear recoils from elastic scattering of atmospheric and diffuse supernova background neutrinos) are expected in the region of interest for the planned exposure of DS-20k. DS-20k will have ultra-low backgrounds, with the ability to measure its backgrounds in situ, and sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 1.2 x 10^-47 cm2 (1.1 x 10^-46 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run with exposure of 100 t yr.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main underlying themes of this research program will be the exploration of this correspondence and its implications. Research in this area has the potential to answer deep questions about the behavior of strongly interacting matter and may also shed light on the problem of reconciling gravity with quantum mechanics, the framework that lies at the basis of our understanding of all other fundamental forces. As a result, this research program serves the national interest by improving our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, hence promoting the progress of basic science. This project is also envisioned to have a number of educational and broader impacts. While working on specific research problems, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive extensive mentoring and training. Undergraduate students will also be supervised and actively involved in research topics related to this program. Professor Giombi plans to develop special courses for graduate students and advanced undergraduates on recent trends in theoretical physics. He is also active in giving lectures at various international schools, as well as organizing workshops and conferences, with a focus on those with interdisciplinary aspects. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Giombi's research program is centered on fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and quantum gravity in various space-time dimensions, with a focus on the interplay between these subjects via the so-called gauge/gravity duality.  The PI's research consists of several interrelated key areas. A substantial effort will be devoted to a deep study of gravitational theories of massless higher-spin fields and their role in the gauge/gravity duality; in particular, this may lead to a direct derivation of the duality in a simplified setting, but it may also offer novel insights on non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories such as 2+1 dimensional gauge theories coupled to fundamental matter fields. A closely related direction will involve studying the space of Conformal Field Theories (CFT) in various dimensions, using non-perturbative tools such as the conformal bootstrap, and investigating in particular the general constraints on Renormalization Group Flows between CFT's. Many CFT's find application in concrete physical problems, such as in various condensed matter systems.  Hence the research carried out in this program will be of intellectual value across various fields of physics."

This project focuses on molecular vibrations that are sensitive to fundamental constants such as the electron mass and the proton mass.  These vibrations occur when atomic nuclei stretch and compress a chemical bond, and their vibration frequencies depend on the proton-to-electron mass ratio.  This team will conduct a proof-of-principle experiment using vibrational states to search for time dependent changes in fundamental constants.  Such changes are predicted by some models of quantum gravity or dark matter, but have not yet been detected experimentally. This project promotes the progress of science by developing new ways to study molecular vibrations as precision tests of fundamental physics. This research takes place at a liberal arts college where undergraduate students are involved in all aspects of the work. In addition to training the next generation of scientists, this work develops skills in experimental physics that are transferable to a wide array of future endeavors.<br/><br/>This project will investigate electric-dipole-forbidden vibrational overtones in trapped molecular ions. The team will drive an overtone as a two-photon transition in the diatomic oxygen molecular ion, which is of long-term interest as both an optical molecular clock and as a probe for time-variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. The nonpolar nature of the molecule suppresses systematic shifts related to electric fields, such as AC Stark shifts and blackbody radiation. A key tool for this work is a stable optical local oscillator that is referenced to a separate optical clock. To demonstrate the promise of this system, this team will reduce the uncertainty on an overtone transition frequency by several orders of magnitude and monitor it over the course of a year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes all the known elementary particles and the interactions between them. Extensions of the model predict not only new particles with large masses but also some with very small masses. Such a candidate for the latter is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force, for example the interactions between protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei. The axion turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Axions constituting the dark matter of our Milky Way halo may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio-Frequency signal in a microwave cavity permeated by a magnetic field. Searching for this signal is the goal of this project.<br/><br/>R&D on superconducting thin-films together with squeezed-state and single-photon detection in quantum electronics will certainly produce unanticipated spin-offs. ADMX-HF at Yale, has already proven to be a great attractor for young talent, with roughly half being women. The experiment provides a focal point for the PI's outreach activities with high school teachers in the greater New Haven area. It is planned to establish a permanent exhibit on dark-sector science at the Yale Peabody Museum, one of the foremost natural history museums in the world.<br/><br/>This experiment represents the inaugural use of both Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) in the microwave cavity search, and operation with a dilution refrigerator. The ADMX-HF PIs have laid out a future strategy for improving sensitivity, showing that, for above 10 GHz, an optimized search will require transitioning from linear amplifiers to photon detection schemes that can evade the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) noise. The experiment's plans include: a) reducing the system noise below the SQL, initially by incorporating a JPA-based squeezed-vacuum state receiver; eventually, photon detector systems based on superconducting qubits will be developed and deployed; b) implementing a Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structure as an alternative to a traditional microwave cavity; if successful it will completely eliminate the forest of TE modes interfering with the TM mode of interest, which have been a bane to fast and efficient mass coverage; and c) boosting the cavity Q by one of two avenues: Incorporating multilayer structures of thin-film Type-II superconductors into the cavity design, or the use of Distributed Bragg Reflector cavities based on nested dielectric cylinders. R&D on the fabrication and characterization of planar thin-films of NbTiN, a Type-II superconductor is showing great promise. Technical deliverables expected are to (a) extend the mass range of the search to 12 GHz (50 micro eV), and (b) deliver an improvement in power sensitivity by a factor of five, and thus approach sensitivity to DFSZ axions. This will dramatically improve our discovery potential in the most promising mass region."

Thus, they are extremely well suited to destroy cancer cells. The laser-driven particle beams are expected to have the required properties so that they can be further developed for tumor therapies. The added advantage that they are compact will make them widely available for hospitals and research centers. If successful, the project will have high pay-off for society.

Thus, the project is in the unique position to achieve simultaneously all the requirements on energy, charge, purity, beam emittance and repetition rate that up to now have been elusive in this field. Existing particle-in-cell simulations show that liquid hydrogen will become transparent during the interaction with the laser thus enhancing the sheet electric fields and resulting in nearly mono-energetic proton beams of energies larger than 50 MeV.  Experimentally demonstrating the predicted proton beams will be a very important achievement, and a demonstration of new accelerator physics. Furthermore, these beams will be suitable for injection and will consequently motivate new studies of hybrid accelerators that have tremendous potential to deliver the urgently needed 230 MeV and above regime for applications in proton radiography, imaging and tumor therapies."

The pursuit of paths such as this is essential to increase the likelihood that a future multiple-tera-electron-volt (i.e. a million-million electron volt) machine to collide electrons with positrons will be built at an acceptable cost.

Two microwave modes of this structure will be excited by the drive beam, with the frequency of the higher mode equal to three times that of the lowest fundamental mode. The frequencies of these two modes are detuned away from that of the drive beam or its third-harmonic, to support unconventional spatiotemporal distributions of the electromagnetic fields in the cavities. This strategy is predicted to allow the accelerator to operate at high acceleration gradient with low breakdown rates and great system simplification. The intended future outcome is the evolution of a viable accelerator structure design that can support a novel two-beam acceleration scheme with both beams moving along the same central axis in the structure."

Several particle accelerators worldwide accelerate ions to very high velocities, approaching the speed of light. For example, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN accelerates ions of lead; the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven collided ions of gold to recreate and study the physics of the first 10 microseconds after the Big Bang.  All require a source of ions. They also require the ions to have high charge, that is, to be stripped from as many electrons as possible. And they require many ions per unit time. The new concept proposed here builds on a type of ion source called an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source, but in a new doughnut-shaped geometry inspired by nuclear fusion experiments.  Such a source, investigated within this project, would have greatly improved characteristics over those presently available. <br/><br/>There have been attempts over the years to increase the density, temperature and confinement-time of Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) plasmas, resulting in ions of higher charge. In fusion plasmas there is a push to increase the 'triple product' of nearly the same quantities for the sake of increasing the fusion reactivity. Inspired by this analogy, this project will numerically explore the ion-source-relevance of toroidal confinement, and compare it with the linear ECRIS paradigm, a magnetic mirror combined with an hexapolar field. At a first glance, the toroidal geometry is highly attractive. It makes a better use of the magnetic field, where toroidal ECRIS could be heated and confined at the same field. On the other hand, ion extraction will not be as straightforward as from a linear ECRIS. This project will numerically address this aspect by comparing magnetostatic, electrostatic and drift-based extraction techniques. The second aspect to investigate is how transport and confinement compare in a linear and a toroidal ECRIS: while hot ions of H, D and T are well-known from fusion research to be better confined in toroidal devices than linear ones, the same is not guaranteed for cold collisional ions of heavy species. Both problems will be addressed by numerically tracing the orbits of several ""test ions"", by means of symplectic integrators, and by letting these ions undergo collisions - according to a distribution function - with each other and with ions and electrons from the background plasma."

Since the 1930s, scientists have built ever bigger and more expensive machines, called accelerators, to accelerate electrons to more than 99% of the speed of light, which Einstein discovered to be the speed limit of the universe.  At such enormous speeds, electrons can probe into nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life.  One of America's biggest electron accelerators, a 2-mile-long machine called ""SLAC"" (which originally stood for ""Stanford Linear Accelerator Center"") accelerates electrons to 99.99999999% of the speed of light.  The energy carried by such an electron, at 30 giga-electronvolts (GeV), is less than a mosquito uses to flap its wings once, but it's a lot of energy for one electron.   The goal of this research project is to enable tabletop electron accelerators that are thousands of times smaller and less expensive than SLAC, but which can nevertheless accelerate electrons to the same energy as SLAC does.  The new technology is a long, narrow pipe made of plasma, or ionized gas (the same state of matter one finds inside fluorescent light bulbs and stars).

The channel formation method is based upon physical principles developed during the 1990s, but is being extended to ~20x lower plasma density.  Formation of short (~1 cm) channels in tenuous He plasma will be demonstrated, using 2J, 80-300 ps drive pulses available in the laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.  This prototype setup will enable the duration, energy and focus of channel-forming pulse, and the pre-ionization and doping conditions that optimize plasma heating and channel formation at low plasma density to be discovered.  Simulations of channel formation in tenuous helium, and channeled propagation of relativistic laser pulses, by the research group at the University of Colorado Boulder will guide experiments.  The intellectual merit lies in discovering laser-plasma conditions that optimize formation of high quality, single-mode plasma channels of lower density than ever previously demonstrated.

Industrial processes involving plasmas contribute to a long list of societal benefits that continues to grow at a rapid pace.  The unique properties of low-pressure ionized gas plasmas enable the manipulation of materials in ways that cannot be achieved by other means. Specifically, their complex dynamics lead to non-equilibrium chemistry; energetic ions, radicals (atoms, molecules or ions that react strongly with substrate surfaces), and photons produced in the plasma through collisions with energetic electrons etch, modify or deposit thin films on materials surfaces. Process outcomes are thus critically sensitive to the abundances of electrons of different energies and other plasma parameters. This project will also celebrate plasma technology and enhance public 'plasma literacy' through the development of a new hands-on outreach exhibit highlighting plasma thrusters for spacecraft propulsion.  The centerpiece of the display will be a working plasma thruster operating at atmospheric pressure. The display will be created in partnership with the Rocket Club at Madison West High School and will become part of the Rocket Club's popular traveling exhibit, viewed by thousands of people each year at science festivals and school visits.<br/><br/>The spectrum of light emitted by the plasma carries an encoded mapping of plasma parameters.  Probing plasma properties by measuring the intensity of plasma light emissions at characteristic wavelengths is made possible through a model that predicts emission spectra by accounting for the excitation and de-excitation processes that govern light emission by the plasma. This project's innovation is the creation of a quantitative emission model for molecular gases, with oxygen as an initial focus.  Through careful consideration of known excitation rates, the study will identify spectral features for inclusion in the model, choosing some that show a strong quantitative dependence on the electron energy distribution function and others that are strong functions of the dissociation fraction, i.e., the fraction of molecules broken up into constituent atoms.  This approach will allow plasma parameters to be determined as the values for which the model produces a best fit to the observed spectral intensities, measured using optical emission spectroscopy (OES).  To demonstrate and explore the capabilities of the molecular OES diagnostic, it will be applied to selected discharge phenomena (i) that exhibit complex plasma dynamics not fully understood, (ii) for which new molecular OES is likely to contribute new insights and (iii) for which the new insights obtained have relevance for development of industrial processes."

Since the 1930s, scientists have built ever bigger and more expensive machines, called accelerators, to accelerate electrons to more than 99% of the speed of light, which Einstein discovered to be the speed limit of the universe.  At such enormous speeds, electrons can probe into nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life.  One of America's biggest electron accelerators, a 2-mile-long machine called ""SLAC"" (which originally stood for ""Stanford Linear Accelerator Center"") accelerates electrons to 99.99999999% of the speed of light.  The energy carried by such an electron, at 30 giga-electronvolts (GeV), is less than a mosquito uses to flap its wings once, but it's a lot of energy for one electron.   The goal of this research project is to enable tabletop electron accelerators that are thousands of times smaller and less expensive than SLAC, but which can nevertheless accelerate electrons to the same energy as SLAC does.  The new technology is a long, narrow pipe made of plasma, or ionized gas (the same state of matter one finds inside fluorescent light bulbs and stars).  This pipe is a ""racetrack"" that is intended ultimately to confine and guide electrons, and a powerful laser pulse that fuels their acceleration, until they reach 30 GeV.

When a solid material is gradually compressed to high pressures above a million atmospheres, the solid state can be transformed to liquid, gas and eventually plasma. This high density, low temperature state of matter is called a strongly coupled plasma, as found in laser fusion cores and dense astrophysical objects. Modeling of material properties in this regime is challenging because it is too cold and dense to apply ideal plasma theory, but the thermal temperature is too high to be treated with condensed matter physics. Thus, experimental benchmarking of the physics models is important for understanding fundamental properties of high-pressured materials. So far, most compression experiments have been conducted on large laser or pulsed electrical current facilities at national laboratories with limited numbers of shots. Using a cost-effective, university-scale facility, this project will explore the feasibility of magnetically driven cylindrical compression to produce pressures comparable to or even higher than those with a planar compression technique used on large facilities. Laser-produced hard x-rays penetrate through a compressed cylinder, providing information on its density profile and material structure. If successful, the cylindrical compression with a compact pulsed power will allow researchers to study a wide range of materials in the strongly coupled regime for fundamental science and applications. This project will provide full-time support for a graduate student to be trained in relativistic laser-plasma interaction and pulsed power plasma physics.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is twofold: characterization of short-pulse laser-produced hard x-rays and demonstration of x-ray probing of a magnetically compressed millimeter-diameter aluminum rod.

Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.  This research is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Dark matter particles may be detected through the observation of nuclear recoils produced when they scatter with nuclei in a target. Nuclear recoils can also be created when neutrinos coherently scatter with nuclei. This process, if ever observed, would help in probing non-standard neutrino interactions, searching for sterile neutrinos, and understanding the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Both scattering rates increase dramatically as the energies of nuclear recoils go down. The lower the energy threshold of a detector, the more events can be detected. <br/><br/>Recent activity in the SURF underground laboratory stimulated support from the South Dakota state to the expansion of PhD programs at state universities. The activity planned with this award provides an opportunity for a PhD student to take part in research related to underground science. The activity may also pave the way for practical applications of undoped NaI/CsI at 77 K in civil uses. For example, un-doped NaI at 77 K has a much faster scintillation signal than NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. It can be used to improve the time and position resolution of PET, resulting in more precise imaging of the concerned tissue of a patient.<br/><br/>A straight forward way to lower the energy threshold of a scintillation detector is to increase its light yield. This award is focused on optimizing the light readout from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K. Both sodium iodide and cesium iodide doped with thallium, NaI/CsI(Tl), are excellent scintillators at room temperature. The PI plans to couple un-doped NaI/CsI directly to the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), cool them down to 77 K to maximize the light readout. Low temperature properties of the PMTs will be compared; dimensions and various surface treatments of un-doped NaI/CsI crystals will be examined to optimize the light collection efficiency. The goal is to verify whether it is possible to lower the energy threshold by a factor of two by increasing the light yield by a factor of two, compared to existing experiments utilizing NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. The decay times of scintillation light from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K are quite different from those of NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. Their effect on signal and background discrimination will also be examined."

Theoretical studies of QCD are central to nuclear physics efforts that seek a better understanding of the fundamental processes taking place in the Universe, processes that ultimately impact life on Earth. In this project, the PI will develop new theoretical and numerical techniques for calculating time-dependent quantities, in particular the nuclear reaction rates important for the development of astrophysical models of how nuclei interact to generate the fundamental elements that appear in the periodic table.  Knowing these rates gives insight into the physics of the early universe and the nuclear reactions that produce the energy in stars. Broader impacts of this project include training of graduate students in numerical and analytical work for an academic or industry career benefiting society.<br/><br/>This project builds on the adiabatic projection method for lattice EFT that was previously introduced by the investigator using funds from a U.S. National Science Foundation grant.  Typical low energy reactions involve interactions between two atomic nuclei. The adiabatic projection method allows an effective two-body description of the participating nuclei starting from a microscopic description of the nuclei themselves in terms of several protons and neutrons. These ideas are developed further, here, in several ways. Mixed channel reactions are calculated that are important in describing inelastic processes. Reactions involving electromagnetic radiation would be calculated. Long-range interaction between nuclei due to the Coulomb force would be studied. Key reactions involving light nuclei that are relevant in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and stellar burning would be studied. Some of these reactions play an important role in interpreting experimental results probing physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. These calculations would complement similar efforts in the field of halo nuclei. These nuclei are described as a tightly bound core with usually one or two valence neutrons forming a halo.

The understanding of these interactions is based on precise measurements of the light that is emitted and absorbed by various atoms and molecules. The precise set of colors (or ""resonant frequencies"") of this light is a unique fingerprint that is used for chemical identification in a broad range of applications from medicine to defense and quality control in manufacturing. The precise measurement of the fingerprint can also tell us details about the fundamental particles that make up atoms.  Recently, a measurement of a particular resonant frequency in hydrogen (an electron bound to a proton) and muonic hydrogen (a heavy version of the electron, the muon, bound to a proton) has revealed a mystery: the diameter of the proton appears to be different depending on which atom it is in. This mystery arises if one assumes that the electron and muon interact with the proton by the well-accepted theory called bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and that any differences must be attributed to the nuclear structure.  Assuming that there have been no mistakes, there are 3 possibilities: QED is incorrect, the nuclear structure is incorrect, or there is some new kind of interaction which has not been taken to account. To decide whether the mystery is due to a problem with QED or not, two scientists from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) propose to measure the resonant frequencies of positronium, the simplest atom (consisting of an electron bound to an anti-electron) that should be described perfectly by bound-state QED theory. The new techniques developed for these measurements will lead to an improvement in the spectroscopy of unstable atoms which are at the frontier of the field of precision spectroscopy. The scientists involved with the project have a strong record in increasing diversity in physics. The PI plays a special role in the local community K-12 system, advising on increasing the number of students taking high school physics and increasing the pool of physical science/engineering majors in higher education and in teacher training. The co-PI has established a pipeline for recruiting local area junior college transfers to UCR, engaging them in research, and mentoring their eventual applications to graduate schools.<br/><br/>The purely leptonic atom positronium is uniquely well-suited for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and provides the understanding and background by which one may extract non-QED physics out of precision atomic measurements on heavier leptons and hadrons. Few have dared to try measurements on positronium at the few parts in 10^12 level that would allow insight into physics such as the proton charge radius and higher level recoil effect corrections in muonium, and that might show differences between light and heavy leptons. The ideal level spacing for a precision measurement on positronium is the 1S-2S interval at approximately 1.234 PHz. Last measured in collaboration with S. Chu, knowledge of the first 10 digits of this interval has stood for 20 years with an uncertainty of 3.2 MHz. The proposed experiment implements a new technique that would dramatically improve the accuracy of Ps atom spectroscopy and potentially other high resolution spectroscopy experiments, for example in muonium, by individual atom trajectory analysis. A position sensitive time-of-flight detector will record the trajectory and speed of every detected atom and thereby remove second-order Doppler shifts, AC Stark Shifts, and better account for transit-time broadening. The new detection method will allow for reducing the laser intensity and the speed of the detected atoms that heretofore have limited the measurement precision. The basic features of the analysis and development of the methods to analyze and reduce uncertainties will be accomplished using a wavemeter with 2 MHz metrology relative to an ultrastable reference cavity. This method will be sufficient to produce narrow line widths (~1 MHz) and a vastly improved signal-to-noise ratio in the 3 year period of the proposal. A 100 fold better measurement and exploration of the systematic effects at 1000 fold better accuracy will be achieved with the acquisition of a laser frequency comb reference."

The broader impacts of this research program include contributions to the database of atomic properties, connections to other scientific fields, and the education and training of undergraduate students. Lasers will be used to measure the properties of negative ions, which are atoms and molecules that have an extra electron. Since ions are electrically charged particles, they can be manipulated to allow precise experiments. The high-precision measurements of electron binding energies in this project will be useful for modeling of chemical reactions and plasma interactions for such practical applications as semiconductor processing, lighting and plasma displays. The detailed studies of negative ions will yield insights into dynamical many-body interactions, which is a general topic of interest for a broad range of fields in physics, chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology. The project will enhance the research and teaching infrastructure of Denison University, an undergraduate college. Students will participate in the experiments on-campus, providing important research experiences for young scientists including technical training in electronics, computers, vacuum systems, lasers, and optics. <br/><br/>This project studies the interactions of photons with negative ions in a series of pulsed-laser photodetachment experiments. The extra electron in a negative ion is bound predominantly by electron correlation effects and therefore negative ions provide a fertile testing ground for state-of-the-art atomic physics calculations regarding these multi-body interactions. Complex atomic negative ions are investigated on-campus at Denison University using tunable infrared laser light to detach outer-shell electrons from negative ions produced in a sputter source. The ground and upper state photodetachment thresholds of several lanthanide and Group III negative ions (Lanthanum and Thallium) will be measured in order to determine the electron affinities and energy levels. These experiments will help explain the current strong disagreement between theoretical predictions and experimental photoelectron spectroscopy results for these interesting systems. The faculty and student researchers will investigate resonances and bound excited states in lanthanide ions including bound-bound electric-dipole transitions that exist in the negative ion of La. Additional studies will investigate inner-shell photodetachment from carbon chain negative ions and two-electron photodetachment processes. The dynamic multi-electron interactions in the photoexcitation and decay of the highly correlated cores of negative ions continue to challenge the fundamental understanding of atomic structure. The series of experiments in this project will test the latest theories describing photodetachment and negative ion structure."

For atoms in a gas, however, it is difficult to observe quantum many-body effects unless the atoms are very cold, because hot atoms behave more like ordinary ballistic particles.  This project will cool lithium atoms below one millionth of a degree Kelvin and manipulate gases of ultra-cold atoms in optical traps in  order to study how quantum mechanics influences large collections of atoms.  This will advance the science known as quantum many-body physics.  The advantage of using ultra-cold atoms is that their temperature, density, and traps can be readily controlled and adjusted.  This is important because it will help physicists understand phenomena such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism.  In particular, this project will study how magnetism and superconductivity co-exist.  This will improve the fundamental understanding of high-temperature superconductors, and may enable fabrication of new materials that superconduct at even higher temperatures.  Another part of this project will probe how quantum many-body phenomena affect the propagation of collective waves known as solitons.   This part of the project is important because it could lead to improved sensors.<br/><br/>Both parts of this project will use an isotope of lithium, in one case a boson, while in the other a fermion.  The goal of the proposed boson experiment is to explore the role of near-integrability in bright matter-wave solitons, either fundamental ones or higher-order soliton breathers. The plan is to create a breather using a protocol developed by theoretical collaborators, and to explore its interactions with a beam splitter formed from a blue-detuned light sheet. The goals are both fundamental and technological. One goal is to create a mesoscopic (N = 100-300) quantum object and observe its properties in a novel one-dimensional interferometer using the light sheet as a beam splitter. If the center-of-mass energy of the soliton is below the binding energy of a single atom, it will not fragment upon interacting with the beam splitter, but rather tunnel and reflect in its entirety, thus creating a Schrdinger cat state. In the second part of this project, this laboratory will implement new ideas for creating and directly detecting the exotic superconducting state known as FFLO (Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state) with a spin-imbalanced Fermi gas. While FFLO is prevalent in 1D, both quantum and thermal fluctuations tend to destroy long-range order in lower dimensions. The recent determination from this laboratory of the phase diagram of the 1D-3D dimensional crossover in a gas of spin-polarized fermions points to a region in parameter space where FFLO is both prevalent and stable. The next goal for this team is to detect the periodic domain walls occupied by the unpaired fermions in time-of-flight expansion in 1D. This would constitute the first direct evidence for FFLO."

The MUSE project is a dedicated investigation of the so-called proton radius puzzle, a very prominent topic in nuclear physics. The experiment will measure the proton charge radius with high precision via lepton-proton elastic scattering, and will compare the interactions of muons and electrons of either charge with the proton at a fundamental level. The experiment will severely constrain possible explanations of the puzzle and has the potential to reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. The DarkLight experiment in preparation at Jefferson Lab aims to discover a new particle associated with a fifth interaction suited to explain several observed anomalies in particle physics while offering a connection to dark matter. Both projects offer high-profile opportunities for students and postdocs at the forefront of international nuclear and particle physics research. The PI's research program has many facets and offers excellent opportunities for cutting-edge education and research purpose domestically and abroad. This proposal combines state-of-the-art detector development at Hampton University with its application in forefront research at PSI and at Jefferson Lab. This provides new research and educational opportunities at first-class research facilities for students from minority populations, predominantly African-Americans, and postdoctoral researchers. The development and operation of GEM detectors in the MUSE and DarkLight environments will be beneficial to advance this still novel technology with potential future applications in other experiments, as well as in the medical sector. <br/><br/>The MUSE experiment has been proposed and approved to provide key insight in the quest to explain the so-called proton radius puzzle - the over five-standard deviation discrepancy between proton charge radius measurements with electronic and muonic probes, respectively. Possible explanations also include new physics beyond the Standard Model. The MUSE experiment aims to address one of the most pressing questions in nuclear and particle science to date. MUSE uses mixed muon and electron beams of either charge (mu+, e+, mu-, e-) to make precise measurements of the lepton-proton elastic scattering cross sections and proton form factors, with the goal to extract the proton charge radius for each probe. It will determine with the highest precision, model independently and conclusively, if there is any proton charge radius difference observed in electron versus muon scattering. At the same time it will determine the role of two-photon exchange and provide tight constraints on theory. Dr. Kohl is one of the co-initiators of the MUSE project. The role of Dr. Kohl's group in MUSE is essential to this project. This project focuses on the challenging task of high-resolution beam particle tracking at MUSE with GEM detectors, in a way not done before at low beam energies. The tracker is exposed to high rate density and beam flux, and needs to operate efficiently at a trigger rate of a few kHz. The DarkLight Phase-I project at Jefferson Lab includes a focused search for a dark photon or neutral boson in the mass region around 17 MeV/c2, where evidence for a fifth-force carrier has been reported.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment.  Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter.  The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours.  Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations.  The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy.  While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos.  The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world.  The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova.  <br/><br/>SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay.  If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna.  If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out.

A major unanswered question associated with the Big Bang hypothesis is why there is more matter in the universe than anti-matter; they should have been created in equal quantities. The likely answer to this question is that there is an unknown force in nature, extremely weak, that favors matter over anti-matter. It is straightforward to show that if this new force exists, it will endow elementary particles and atoms with a property known as an ""electric dipole moment"", a small separation of electric charge along the spin axis of the particle or atom. A measurement of the electric dipole moment of 199Hg (the spin  isotope of mercury atoms) will provide unambiguous evidence for this new force that breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-matter. The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science. The study of the particles that constitute the universe and the laws of nature that govern interactions between the particles serve to advance our understanding of the physical world and stimulate the development of technologies that have arisen from that understanding. Previous experiments have not been sensitive enough to detect the electric dipole moment of atoms or particles. The 199Hg project will constitute the most sensitive electric dipole moment search ever conducted. As such, it will provide excellent training for students in state-of-the-art experimental atomic physics techniques and high precision measurement techniques. The project will advance the field of nuclear spin magnetometry, which has broad application to measurements of magnetic fields in general. Society will benefit from the training of a new generation of scientists and from a more complete understanding of the universe we live in.<br/><br/>High precision table-top experiments, such as this 199Hg project, provide a complementary path to particle accelerators for probing the underlying symmetries and forces of nature. An electric dipole moment of an atom can only exist if time-reversal (T) symmetry is violated, and T symmetry violation is directly related to the matter/anti-matter asymmetry (through the CPT theorem). One measures an electric dipole moment by observing a change in the atomic Larmor (spin precession) frequency of the 199Hg atoms as an external electric field is applied to vapor cells that contain the atoms. This experiment will use a stack of four vapor cells in a common magnetic field. Oppositely directed electric fields will be applied to the two innermost vapor cells while the outer two cells, with no electric fields, will serve as co-magnetometers. The atoms will be spin polarized using resonant 254 nm laser light and the Larmor frequencies will be read-out by the optical rotation of the polarization of non-resonant laser light that traverses the vapor cells. A previous experiment, limited by gradients in the magnetic field, achieved an upper limit on the electric dipole moment of 199Hg of less than 3 x 10-30 e-cm. this new experiment will improve the magnetic field uniformity to push the experimental sensitivity into the 10-31 e-cm range."

This project will develop a new way to study the optical fields near such a laser focus.  The electric and magnetic fields in such extreme light can rip electrons away from any substance and then accelerate the electrons at more than sextillion (thousand billion billion) g's, where one g is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.  The freed electrons are then propelled to very near the speed of light, so Einstein's equations of relativity are required to describe their motion.  Electrons under these extreme conditions scatter wavelength-shifted light out of the laser focus (called nonlinear Thomson scattering), and this can reveal the dynamics of the electron motion and thus the structure of the laser fields.   This research team has developed techniques to distinguish the scattered photons from the quintillion background photons that comprise the laser pulse that drives the electrons.  With this project, the team will use the scattered light as a probe to map the strength and polarization of the optical fields in and around the focus.  Such a laser focus is challenging to characterize in any other way, since the focus is often as small as an individual pixel on a camera.  Furthermore, at full power any camera placed in the focus would be destroyed.  Analysis of the electric and magnetic fields inside a very intense but tiny laser focus will be helpful for understanding interactions between laser light and atoms, molecules, and solids that are studied with the world's most powerful lasers.  This project will also provide an opportunity for students to be trained on optics and photonics technologies and contribute to progress in fundamental science.<br/><br/>The ability to measure individual photons scattered from only a few electrons in a laser focus enables observation of fundamental relativistic phenomena at very low densities (essentially a vacuum).  This will allow this team to avoid the confounding influence of plasma dynamics that occur for higher densities.  They will study the polarization of nonlinear Thomson scattering in the spatial distribution of the scattered fundamental, second, and third harmonic light.  The polarization contains an added dimension of information, which has not previously been investigated or measured.  The rich structure in polarization-resolved scattering plots promises new insights into electron dynamics. This team's simulations of relativistic electron trajectories within a tight laser focus show that electron trajectories are sensitive to the details of the field vectors of the laser. The use of a deformable mirror will allow them to create ideal and exotic focal shapes to test the sensitivity of nonlinear Thomson scattering to the details of the vector field distributions in the focus."

Dipole-dipole interactions are essential in protein formation and folding.  The interactions can lead to collective and emergent phenomena that cannot be understood by a simple extrapolation of the microscopic laws of a few particles. The research supported by this NSF award aims to gain an experimentally confirmed understanding of many-body dipole-dipole interactions in atomic ensembles. This will be accomplished by using an advanced laser spectroscopic technique that is uniquely sensitive to many-body interactions in complex systems. The experimental results will be compared to simulated results to help develop a theoretical model. This research will contribute to the general understanding of many-body physics in an ensemble of interacting particles, which has profound implications in fields ranging from optical atomic clocks to photosynthesis. The experimental and theoretical approaches developed in the project can be used to study other many-body systems as well. This project also includes efforts to enhance the capacity to train students at Florida International University, a minority serving institution, in science and technology, to strengthen the education of underrepresented groups in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to quantitatively understand many-body dipole-dipole interactions in atomic ensembles, at densities varying across nine orders of magnitude, and both with or without the presence of thermal motion. The effects of dipole-dipole interactions will be probed by double-quantum two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy, which provides a sensitive and background-free detection of many-body dipole-dipole interactions. The temporal resolution of femtosecond laser pulses allows one to probe the dynamics during the transient processes of interactions. The experiments will be performed on a hot atomic rubidium vapor and also with cold rubidium atoms. The hot atomic vapor provides a broad range of mean interatomic separations and many-body dynamics associated with thermal motion. In comparison, the cold atoms provide an environment in the virtual absence of thermal motion.   Comparing the results from cold and hot atoms enables this group to study the effects of thermal motion on the dipole-dipole interactions. The resulting structural and dynamic information will contribute to the development of a theoretical model based on the exciton formalism that accounts for the dipole-dipole interactions in an atomic ensemble. The study will determine fundamental parameters such as dipole-dipole interaction strength, effective interaction range, the number of interacting atoms, excitation-induced many-body states, effects of a buffer gas, and effects of thermal motion of the dipole-dipole interaction in atomic ensembles."

The experiments will use ""Rydberg atoms"" (those in which at least one of the negatively-charged electrons has much more energy than normal and moves in a large, slow orbit around the positively-charged nucleus). Because the electric forces between the nucleus and the distant electron are so weak in Rydberg atoms, they are very sensitive to their surroundings. This sensitivity will be exploited in the experiments, magnifying the atom's response to its environment and making it easier to change the electron's motion or manipulate the forces between atoms in controlled ways. Some of the experiments could have direct applications in quantum computing because Rydberg atoms might serve to store and process information. In other cases, the experiments will provide insights to problems involving more complex systems, for example energy transfer in light harvesting systems, or the use of very brief laser pulses to view electron motion in molecules over extremely short time intervals (the so-called ""attosecond"" regime, which is a million-trillion times smaller than 1 second).<br/><br/>The experiments will utilize ultrafast and cold atom techniques, separately and in combination, exploiting intense ultrashort terahertz pulses and controlled interatomic couplings to manipulate electron dynamics and/or atom-atom correlations. These systems are rich with opportunities for exploring novel aspects of few- and many-body quantum mechanics at the interface between ultrafast/strong field physics and cold atom physics. The problems to be addressed represent real challenges as the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the dynamics span many orders of magnitude, from electronic motion within individual atoms to correlations involving multiple atoms. One set of experiments will seek to further characterize the novel ionization behavior of atoms exposed to intense, true single-cycle pulses. Another will attempt to use such pulses to induce both ionization and recombination, coherently shuttling bound electrons from atoms to their neighbors. A third line of experiments will utilize efficient laser excitation of atom pairs into, and out of, Rydberg states at prescribed interatomic distances, toggling strong repulsive interactions between atoms to manipulate the position correlation of cold atoms in a magneto optical trap. Possibilities for producing self-ordered arrays of atoms without an explicit external confinement potential will be pursued. Lastly, controlled dipole-dipole couplings between atoms will be used to entangle electronic wavepackets on neighboring atoms, resulting in the transfer of coherent electronic wavepacket motion from atoms to their neighbors, at distances of several microns. New insights obtained from the proposed experiments have the potential to impact several other scientific areas including condensed matter physics, chemical physics, quantum information, quantum control, and attosecond science."

The result is a deeper understanding of important materials, and new insights into the principles of material properties.  By creating and studying models of new materials, the researchers want to find out if speculative new materials can be realized in Nature.  The experimental program employs methods developed in atomic physics to control the motion and orientation of atoms with unprecedented precision.  Those well controlled building blocks can now be assembled into new materials like Lego pieces.  These new materials may show behavior similar to naturally occurring materials which are not fully understood, or even display phenomena never seen before.   Assembling new forms of matter with well separated atoms has the advantage that the building blocks and their interactions are well known, and therefore also the basic equations describing their behavior.  This together leads to a platform where both theoretical methods (analyzing these equations) and experimental methods (using the precision of atomic physics) can be combined to obtain a deeper understanding for important materials and find new possibilities for synthesizing new materials.  The major focus of the research program is on the question how strong magnetic fields and magnetic couplings (called spin-orbit coupling) change the properties of electrons in semiconductors and metals.  Since our Lego pieces are neutral atoms, real magnetic fields are replaced by so-called synthetic magnetic fields created with the help of laser beams.  In addition, the researchers will study fundamental aspects of ferromagnetism, and create ultracold molecules.  The realization of new forms of ultracold matter will advance our understanding of materials and provide guiding principles for materials research.  The proposed work is fundamental in its immediate impact, but in the long run, it should lead to devices and advanced materials with yet unknown properties, and open new possibilities and applications.  Besides promoting the progress of science; this program educates students and postdocs and prepares them for a career in areas of advanced technology.<br/><br/>More technically, the goal of this project is to further advance the use of cold atoms as model systems for strongly correlated matter, but also to take this approach to the next level by creating materials with no known counterpart in Nature.  In the spirit of quantum simulations, samples will be prepared which are the simplest possible realizations of many-body Hamiltonians representing idealized paradigmatic forms of matter. The major foci of the proposed research in the next five years are the themes of synthetic gauge fields and spin orbit coupling.  These goals make strong connections with current frontiers in many-body theory and in condensed matter physics, including the quantum Hall effect, topological insulators, and strongly correlated states.  These materials are more profoundly quantum mechanical than ordinary materials because they exploit non-trivial quantum mechanical phases (geometric phases, Berry phase) or quantum entanglement.  In addition,it is planned to explore itinerant ferromagnetism, cooling to picokelvin temperatures using adiabatic state preparation, and the sodium-lithium dimer as a heteronuclear dipolar molecule."

Our understanding of nearly everything we see in nature relies on quantum mechanics as applied to atoms and their close cousins, molecules (two or more atoms stuck together by a chemical bond). From humans and other living things to computers and the internet, physical systems can be explained only by knowing how atoms and molecules behave in detail. Yet, although quantum mechanics has been very successful in describing very simple atomic systems, we do not yet know how to apply the theory quantitatively to describe all the phenomena that we see. In particular, to invent new technological and biological substances, we need to understand the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules better. The eventual goal of much of physics (including atomic physics) is to have a complete understanding of all matter and the tools to invent new types of matter. This project is a step toward developing a detailed quantum understanding of the interactions between atoms and molecules in a gas at a very low temperature. When cooled, the quantum nature of atoms and molecules is greatly amplified, exposing its nature to careful study. <br/><br/>The essential experimental approach to this work is to use magnetic trapping of atoms and molecules to study their collisions using laser spectroscopy. The technical method will be to use buffer-gas cooling to form a beam of atoms and molecules, which will be optically pumped into magnetically trapped states as they pass through the trapping region. Half the molecules in the beam are originally in the low-field-seeking quantum state. These molecules lose energy as they approach the magnetic field maximum of the trap, where they will be optically pumped into their high-field-seeking state. These molecules then continue to lose energy as they travel toward the trap center. Near the trap center lasers pump the molecules into their trapped state. Only two photons are scattered in this process and this (along with energy loss as the molecules pass through the trap) leads to irreversible trap loading. We will trap molecules of calcium monofluoride and other small molecules into a magnetic trap using this method. Atoms can also be co-loaded with molecules, at high enough density for evaporative cooling. We will co-load lithium and/or potassium atoms and study collisions between them and the trapped molecules, testing molecular theory and investigating a route toward ultracold molecules using sympathetic cooling. Spectroscopy will reveal both the state distribution of the molecules, as well as their number and temperature. Investigation of trap loss can be used to study spin-relaxation collisions (for which there is detailed theory for some atom-molecule pairs). The longer term goal of this work is to enable observation of exchange of energy and other phenomena in increasingly complex atom-molecule collisions, starting with diatomic and triatomic molecules. This will add to our fundamental understanding of nature and help science to design new physical systems and new tools for chemistry and biology."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  The Standard Model predicted that there were three different kinds of neutrinos, all massless, that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they undergo whenever they interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will make comprehensive measurements of neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations to investigate neutrino CP violation, determine the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates, and perform precision tests of the neutrino Standard Model. DUNE will take advantage of both an accelerator-based neutrino beam from Fermilab and be sensitive to extra-terrestrial neutrinos, including those from supernova explosions. DUNE's massive detector, a 40-kton Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) System, will both enable these precision measurements in neutrino physics and astrophysics as well as extend the sensitivity in the search for nucleon decay.  <br/><br/>The LAr-TPC System will be divided into four 10-kton modules.  At the heart of two of these large modules are wire chamber planes called Anode Plane Assemblies (APA) which record the signatures of particles propagating in the argon and provide high resolution images of neutrino interactions.  The groups leading this planning project, funded in part through earlier investments from the NSF, have led the development of wire chamber planes for LAr-TPC experiments laying the groundwork for DUNE.  These groups will now develop a construction strategy, methodology and plan to construct half of the APAs needed for the first two 10-kton modules of DUNE.  It is envisioned that 2-3 APA ""factories"" would be built at university sites that have the technical facilities and infrastructure required to host the APA production lines. These multiple regional factories would allow for direct participation by many collaborating university groups.   Ultimately, developing and then operating an APA construction program would provide excellent training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. It is anticipated that the project would interest and engage a diverse group of undergraduate students at each of the construction sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum mechanics is reversible, that is, a hypothetical movie of a quantum system looks the same if it is played forward or in reverse.  So how can damping, something non-reversible, emerge in quantum physics?  This project aims to engineer a simple model system consisting of an ""atomic quantum dot"" (an artificial atom) coupled to an empty vacuum, the simplest of all environments. This tunable experimental system, which emits matter waves rather than optical radiation, will allow for precise investigation of damping as the structure of the environment is changed. It should be possible to build laser-like sources using a large number of regularly spaced atomic quantum dots, and to exploit the coupling to the environment for a novel form of quantum tunneling, which may find use in quantum simulation of solid-state phenomena. While this first set of experiments sheds light on the nature of quantum mechanical damping, a second set of experiments will investigate whether such damping due to a large environment can be avoided. Here, the model system considered will consist of an atom moving through a one-dimensional atomic gas in a tube-like geometry. Collisions should slow down the atom and damp its motion completely, but it may be possible to harness quantum mechanics to shield the atomic motion by rendering the environment effectively transparent, such that damping is suppressed. Developing ways to control damping and dissipation are of paramount importance for quantum simulation and quantum information science, and the results of this project will be of relevance in addressing some of the fundamental challenges.<br/><br/>The project is devoted to the experimental study of novel dissipative systems in the context of ultracold atomic physics, focusing on engineered atomic quantum dots and mobile impurities coupled to a bosonic environment with controllable many-body character. The implementation of such systems is made possible through the use of ultracold, homonuclear atomic mixtures with hyperfine-state components that are independently controlled with state-dependent optical potentials. The project goals include an exploration of spontaneous and superradiant matter-wave emission, of couplings induced by evanescent matter-wave fields arising from coherent dressing, as well as couplings provided by phononic excitations of a superfluid environment, with the prospect of realizing a dissipative quantum Ising chain. Exploiting the coupling to one-dimensional Bose gases, the project furthermore aims to investigate dissipative and coherent transport for unconfined impurities near integrability, with the prospect of observing novel many-body effects."

One of the most important properties of these atoms is that when the electron is excited to a very large-sized orbit using laser light, a Rydberg atom can interact with other Rydberg atoms at macroscopic distances, on the order of microns. The interaction range is over 1,000 times larger than for typical atom-atom interactions. These unique ultralong-range interactions have many uses in exploring fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications that exploit the unique features of quantum mechanics that can be used for quantum engineering. For example, these interactions can be utilized to put collections of atoms into quantum mechanically entangled states, that is, states where the collection of atoms acts as a single ""super atom"" which interacts with light in an enhanced manner.  These types of states have many uses in the area of quantum information science and quantum sensing. <br/><br/>In this project, the group will investigate how to manipulate the interactions between Rydberg atoms with electric and magnetic fields in order to use them for quantum engineering and fundamental studies of quantum mechanics.

These interactions will be studied using multi-color excitation of Rydberg atoms at ultracold temperatures (T<1mK), and quantitative comparisons between theory and experiments will be carried out. The topology of the potentials will be investigated in terms of gauge potentials. Dephasing rates of excited super atoms will be studied.

Understanding and controlling this internal motion is important: For example, proton motion does much of the work in organic chemistry, energy storage, and biomedicine, therefore controlling proton motion with external forces may be useful in future implementations of chemical synthesis or quantum computing; or even for splitting water to make hydrogen fuel. This NSF program will explore new ways to create and control the motion of protons and electrons inside molecules using external laser fields in the laboratory. The laser field strengths must be large enough to overcome the internal fields that hold molecules together, on the order of volts per Angstrom; and they must be able to pulse on and off in well under a hundredth of a trillionth of a second as well, to keep up with the natural pace of movement inside molecules. Research using these laser tools will test basic models of molecular transformations, such as conjectures that there are special atomic geometries where molecules become especially susceptible to control by outside forces. The molecules to be tested are water and acetylene, both proton-rich building-blocks for many chemical processes. This research will also provide training for students and postdocs, and thus prepare them to contribute technical talents that are needed to support the nation's economy and security in the coming century. <br/><br/>Intramolecular motion is one of the core issues in molecular physics, and the key to many important physical and chemical processes such as chemical synthesis and energy production. This activity explores how ultrafast laser-induced strong field interactions can change the motion of atoms in molecules and therefore alter the path of chemical change. These paths are complicated in part because the motion of every atom in a molecule generally affects every other atom. The result is that motion takes place in a high-dimensional space: three internal dimensions for a simple three-atom molecule like water; but three additional dimensions for every additional atom in the molecule. The high-dimensional topology of this space is difficult to visualize and highly non-intuitive. It leads to special locations in this molecular landscape -- seams or surfaces structures embedded in the higher dimensional space -- where the interatomic bonds can rearrange without any energy penalty. Here the objective is to understand how high-dimensional features in coupled atomic motion can be altered by strong laser fields to enhance, suppress, or modify atomic rearrangement, rapid ionization, multiple ionization, and even Coulomb explosions. This tests a hypothesis that external strong fields coupled to atomic motion can control and redirect these natural processes. Water and acetylene have been selected for study because their internal motion is dominated by hydrogen atoms, which move more rapidly because of the low mass of their proton nuclei. This enhances the effects under study. The investigations use infrared, ultraviolet, and vacuum ultraviolet coherent laser fields to both excite and control these molecular systems. Results of the excitation and the control are measured by recording the velocities of all of the molecular constituents directly, either by allowing the molecules to fall apart or by forcing them apart with a laser-produced Coulomb explosion. Understanding molecular behavior in external fields has relevance for many practical applications areas, including catalysis, proton medical therapy and photo-initiated hydrogenase chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to see objects that are too small to see with the naked eye is crucial for characterizing materials, for manufacturing, and for forensic science.  New capabilities in scientific research and technology are enabled by developing novel new microscopes with enhanced resolution and sensitivity.  This project will explore ways to use focused atom beams to probe surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution.  This addresses the longstanding goal in atomic physics of making a neutral atom microscope, similar to an electron microscope, but with different chemical sensitivity and less destructive interactions.  An improved method to focus atom beams will be implemented using a pulsed magnetic lens.  This aberration-corrected lens for atoms will enable the research team to pioneer applications for a neutral-atom microscope.  The correction of aberrations is tremendously important for the performance of optical microscopes, and has enabled atomic scale resolution for electron microscopes. A breakthrough in aberration-corrected lenses for atoms will enable advances in atom lithography and the operation of a neutral atom microscope with molecular resolution.  Students working on this project will gain training in atomic physics, atom optics, and surface chemistry research methods, and this will help prepare them for careers in universities and high tech industries.<br/><br/>The principle of the microscope to be developed in this project is that neutral neon atoms in an excited metastable state are focused to a surface.  After the impact of each atom, an electron is emitted which is energy-analyzed, providing a unique fingerprint of the chemical composition of the surface.  The image will be acquired by rastering the atoms across the surface.  The research team will use a pulsed electromagnetic coil as a lens for magnetic imaging of atoms. This allows for pulsed, high-current wires to exert a brief, strong focusing field on an atomic beam, taking advantage of the high refractive power without subjecting the atoms to fringing fields as they enter and leave the lens. Aberration correction will be achieved by tapering the lens to be narrower towards the front, thereby applying a greater force to the faster atoms. The pulsed lens is well-matched to a pulsed supersonic beam which produces a very bright beam of metastable neon atoms. The team has constructed a working prototype and plans to implement methods of beam brightening and velocity selection.  With these improvements, a resolution better than 10 nm is expected. Further developments of the atomic lens will address residual aberrations.  In parallel, the group will develop metastable impact electron microscopy using an analyzer system. Combining the two developments will enable demonstration of a neutral atom microscope with nanoscale resolution."

This special atomic gas has the properties of being ""strongly interacting,"" and ""fermionic"" which causes it to behave in many ways like a liquid metal. When two clouds of these atoms collide, they bounce off of one another, creating shock waves. These experiments simulate properties of exotic matter in intellectual disciplines well outside atomic physics, including neutron stars and quark-gluon plasmas, which existed microseconds after the Big Bang. The experiments also test theories of super-high temperature superconductors, which operate far above room temperature, enabling energy-saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. The project provides an ideal learning opportunity and serves to train undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates, who work as a team in a supportive environment with the PI to devise, construct, and perform new experiments, and to theoretically analyze the results. With this broad training, graduating students and post-doctoral associates are well situated to be leaders in tackling research questions that arise in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will study hydrodynamic transport and energy flow in a Fermi gas of 6Li atoms trapped in designer optical potentials.  The potentials will imaged onto the cloud from a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) to control the spatial profiles of the atomic gas density and temperature.  Confining the atoms between two repulsive sheet potentials enables in-situ imaging with nearly constant atom density along the line-of-sight direction perpendicular to the sheets. This suppresses unwanted averaging of the measured column density over hydrodynamic and low density ballistic regions, which has plagued previous studies. With tunable interaction strength, this method offers new opportunities to explore concepts that cross interdisciplinary boundaries, including local transport properties of scale-invariant systems, recent conformal field theory predictions of quasi-steady state energy flow between scale-invariant systems at different temperatures, and shock wave formation in strongly interacting fluids.  The goals of this project include in-situ measurements of i) 1D hydrodynamic flow, local shear viscosity and thermal conductivity; ii) Energy flow between two scale-invariant clouds at different temperatures; iii) Shock wave formation versus interaction strength, temperature, and density profiles."

The more complex the device, the greater the likelihood that it will consist of many interconnected parts, as is the case, for example, with the hardware in a computer.  Physicists have long known that the behavior of interconnected systems will change in fundamental ways when the entire network (nodes and interconnects) is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, and more recent work has shown that this allows for dramatic improvements in the performance of computers, communication networks, and sensors.  Building and operating quantum devices of this sort remains a grand challenge for modern science.  This project will contribute by developing a quantum interface that can connect distant quantum systems. The main goal is to use laser light, first to connect and ""entangle"" the quantum states of atoms confined in a ""trap"" made of laser light, and subsequently to perform a quantum limited measurement on them.  Ensembles of atoms are used in the most precise sensors of time (atomic clocks), of rotation and acceleration (inertial sensors), and of magnetic fields.  The principal investigator and others have demonstrated that a quantum interface can be used to suppress the intrinsic quantum uncertainty of measurement (a phenomenon known as ""squeezing""), and thus to improve the precision of such atomic sensors beyond the ""standard"" limit. This project seeks to increase the amount of squeezing that can be generated by making optimal use of the internal structure of the atoms, with the goal of boosting measurement sensitivity by an additional order of magnitude.  A secondary goal is to explore a version of the atom-light quantum interface where the light is guided by an optical nanofiber and overlaps with atoms trapped close to its surface.  This geometry is far more compact and has the potential to operate as a quantum node in an optical fiber based network.<br/><br/>Quantum control on all scales, from single particles to complex many body systems, is a grand challenge for the second century of quantum mechanics. Over the past decade there has been substantial progress towards this goal, including significant advances in real-world technical capabilities. As a result, non-trivial quantum control has become routine in experiments ranging from quantum metrology to analog quantum simulation and rudimentary digital quantum computing. The goal of this project is to contribute new ideas and capabilities in the areas of quantum many body control and quantum metrology. The context is that of a Cs atomic ensemble, driven by magnetic fields and coupled to a quantized light field for the purpose of generating entanglement and performing quantum limited measurements. Two distinct versions will be studied: a ""free-space"" geometry with atoms in a dipole trap coupled to a paraxial probe beam, and a ""nanofiber"" geometry with atoms trapped and probed by evanescent fields around an optical nanofiber. The principal investigator brings expertise in internal state control of complex atoms that can significantly enhance the entangling power of the atom-light interface. A common measure of entangling power is the spin squeezing generated by quantum backaction when measuring the collective atomic spin.  A preliminary exploration indicates that squeezing can be increased from a baseline of ~3dB to as much as 8dB through optimal control of the atomic internal state, reaching a level comparable to cavity enhanced experiments. The nanofiber platform is less developed, but short-circuits some of the limitations that diffraction imposes on atom-light coupling in free space, and has the potential to be more compact, less complex, and far more robust than cavity-enhanced setups."

This project will focus on trapping and controlling the molecular ion N_2H+, but the approach can be generalized to many other molecular ions. The N_2H+ molecular ion will be co-trapped and sympathetically cooled with a calcium ion to near the ground state of their shared motion. Pure quantum states of the molecular ion can then be initialized by projective measurements using quantum-logic spectroscopy, as recently demonstrated on the calcium hydride ion CaH+ by the investigators.  This is important because this approach can  advance quantum chemistry and may impact materials science and the chemical, biological, and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, new and superior reference spectra for astronomical observations could lead to a better understanding of interstellar gas clouds and the universe, including stringent tests of physics beyond the standard model. Ultimately, controlling molecules at the quantum level may enable precisely orchestrated collisions and fully controlled quantum chemistry.<br/><br/>While laser cooling, trapping, and precision measurements of diatomic molecules are making tremendous progress, polyatomic molecules have eluded precision studies due to their complicated level structures and vast number of populated states. This project will extend the technique of quantum-logic spectroscopy to prepare pure quantum states of polyatomic molecules, and to manipulate and detect their states with minimal perturbations such as Doppler or pressure shifts. Precision spectroscopy will ultimately only be limited by the lifetime of the states and can therefore be pushed to levels that have only been reached previously in optical atomic clocks. The molecule N_2H+ was one of the first ions observed in interstellar clouds and remains one of the most important tracers in astrophysics. Improved spectroscopic precision might enable improved constraints on possible spatial or temporal variations of fundamental constants.

Improving the precision and sensitivity of physical measurement is therefore key to furthering the progress of science.  This project will explore a novel method to improve measurements using quantum optics to advance the art of interferometry.  Interferometric measurements, in which the phase difference between two waves is measured in order to gain information about the physical laws that cause such a phase difference, are among the most precise classes of measurements.  A spectacular illustration of the power of interferometry is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has revealed the minescule ripples of the fabric of space-time caused by the merging of black holes in the cosmos, with three such events observed since the fall of 2015. Other prevalent examples of interferometry include high-resolution phase masks in microlithography, crucial to semiconductor chip fabrication and Moore's law in the computer industry; interferometric techniques for microscopy, such as phase contrast imaging in biology; and Ramsey interferometry, used for precise atomic clocks. Thus the results of this project can have a significant impact in a number of critical areas of technology.<br/><br/>The ultimate sensitivity of interferometers such as LIGO and atomic clocks is dictated by quantum mechanics. Indeed, any interferometer, for example an optical one, possesses intrisically quantum mechanical measurement noise floors which are consequences of the quantum duality between the undulatory  (electromagnetic wave) and corpuscular (photon) nature of light. Classical interferometers, such as LIGO and atomic clocks in their current versions, are shot-noise limited, which means their phase noise floor is of the order of the reciprocal of the square root of the average particle number (photon or atom) used in a measurement. However, this is far from the ultimate, Heisenberg, limit, which is of the order of the reciprocal of the average particle number. This limit can be reached by ""quantum engineering"" the light waves used in the interferometer. This project puts forward a new type of Heisenberg-limited interferometer, in which twin optical beams, the photon-correlated beams emitted by a optical parametric amplifier, see one photon subtracted from them in an indistinguishable manner before they are used as input in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The project is unique among all previous proposals for Heisenberg-limited interferometry in that it features a Heisenberg-limited noise floor, a strong, direct interference fringe signal, and is experimentally feasible using state-of-the-art quantum optics technology that was previously demonstrated in the group of Prof. Pfister at the University of Virginia. If successful, this project could bring about multiple orders of magnitude measurement sensitivity improvement in phase-contrast imaging, which would allow nondestructive in vivo biological imaging by applying quantum light."

The team will use ""optomechanical"" control to study the quantum behavior of macroscopic objects. This is an area of particular interest for fundamental science and for potential technological applications. From a fundamental point of view, the laws of quantum mechanics describe a world in which objects may behave as though they are in multiple places at once, and in which measurements unavoidably disturb the object that is measured. These strange effects are most obvious in the behavior of small objects, and tend to become more obscured the larger the object is.  Nevertheless, quantum mechanics predicts that these effects can be observed in any object that is sufficiently well isolated from heat and friction, and which is measured with sufficient sensitivity. In this project, quantum effects in the motion of a small volume of superfluid liquid helium will be studied. Superfluid liquid helium can be cooled to exceptionally low temperatures and offers extremely low levels of friction.  Additionally, superfluid liquid helium is compatible with ultrasensitive laser-based measurements that are ideally suited to induce, control, and measure the liquid's quantum motion. Studying the quantum motion of macroscopic objects (and liquid objects in particular) will represent important scientific progress, as it will explore long-standing questions about our ability to access and control quantum effects in a new class of objects. It will also allow the team to explore the how to develop superfluid optomechanical devices for applications such as advanced sensing and communications technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to access qualitatively new regimes of quantum optomechanics. Specifically, the team will study non-Gaussian quantum effects in the motion of macroscopic objects, both when this motion can be described in terms of conventional normal modes and when this description breaks down. To accomplish this, they will use optomechanical devices that consist of a miniature Fabry-Perot cavity filled (or partially filled) with superfluid liquid He. The work will build on prior results with similar devices and will combine new conceptual and technical advances in order to realize new capabilities. These advances fall into three categories. First, the team will adapt single-photon and single-phonon detection techniques for use with superfluid-based devices. Second, the team will engineer devices in which the surface waves of a superfluid body couple to the optical modes of a high-finesse cavity. Third, the team will use multimode optomechanical coupling to study the quantum behaviors of systems with strong non-reciprocity and non-trivial topological features. The proposed activity will advance scientific knowledge on multiple fronts. Accessing and controlling non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems will enable the group to perform a broad class of quantum sensing and information processing tasks that to date have been out of their reach. Providing access to a wide range of distinctly quantum effects in massive objects will also provide a route towards testing specific questions related to quantum gravity, discrete space-time, and modifications of quantum mechanics (such as spontaneous collapse models). Measuring Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantum effects in multimode devices that can be tuned to access non-reciprocal and topologically non-trivial dynamics will also represent an important advance. This is because in the classical regime, the conventional normal mode description of coupled oscillators breaks down in such systems, as do some key aspects of adiabaticity, and it is unclear at present how this breakdown will alter the system's quantum behavior.   This highlights the opportunities for discovery that will come from exploring this system."

Advances in this area have resulted in a better understanding of quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the behavior of matter at the microscopic level, and have enabled the new field of quantum information in which quantum mechanics is used as the basis of new technologies related to encryption, information processing, and computing. Manipulating the internal states of atoms involved in chemical reactions makes it possible to produce specific targeted reaction products. Atomic interactions also give rise to collective atomic behavior that result, for example, in magnetism or superconductivity. Tuning such interactions therefore provides insights into such phenomena which, in turn, can enable the design of improved magnetic materials for computer hard drives or improved superconductors for power transmission. This project aims to improve our ability to control and manipulate atomic states and to develop a better understanding of atomic interactions.  In specific, this project will heat strontium atoms in a special oven until they boil out of a small hole, forming collimated beam to atoms and then lasers will be used to pump energy into the atoms.  After this, electric fields will be applied to the atoms to distort them, they will be allowed to interact, and then other lasers, electric fields, and cameras will be used to determine the results.  Similar studies will be done that are complementary to these, using a laser to cool the atoms rather than heating them in an oven.    <br/><br/><br/>As a starting point, strontium atoms in well-defined initial Rydberg states will be prepared by use of laser light. Techniques developed to manipulate the wave functions of such atoms using a carefully-tailored series of electric field pulses will be exploited to create strongly-interacting Rydberg systems. Initially, a dipole blockade will be employed to create pairs of (weakly-interacting) Rydberg atoms with well-defined separations. Their mutual interactions will then be increased by simultaneously exciting both to some selected higher state, the degree of interaction being tuned by choice of target state (and atom separation). The time evolution of the product two-electron wave packet will be examined to explore energy interchange and search for long-lived configurations where, due to their correlated motions, the electrons remain far apart. Measurements will be extended to include three, or more, strongly interacting Rydberg atoms and explore the onset of many-body effects. Attempts will also be made to create, within a single atom, long-lived two-electron-excited states, i.e., so-called planetary atoms. In addition, control of the interactions between ground state atoms through optical dressing with radiation tuned near resonance with a Rydberg state will be explored. Preliminary measurements have revealed unexpectedly large ground state atom loss rates and the processes responsible will be identified and means to mitigate them sought."

The outcome will be a novel, fully-working front-end instrument that can be used for multiple purposes. Based on a concept originally introduced in 1981, but never realized, this will be the first demonstration of RFQ direct injection into a compact, high intensity cyclotron. The design is potentially transformative and promises a 3-5 times increase in efficiency of bunching and injection over classic front-end cyclotron designs. It is more compact and of comparable cost, significantly advancing accelerator technology. The accelerator system planned relies on conventional, well known, proven technologies. The innovation is in the combination of these technologies. The challenges are in the demonstration of, on one hand, the individual performances of the various components (the current from a source, RFQ and transmission, and coupling to the cyclotron) and, on the other hand, their integration into a compact, high beam current, cost-effective proton driver front-end. <br/><br/>Proton drivers have a broad impact; they are research tools (for neutrino physics, secondary particles for condensed matter research, neutron sources), tools for the future of energy, and more. The development of high intensity cyclotrons has two important impacts for industry. The first is to increase the energy, intensity and versatility of radiopharmaceutical cyclotrons. Protons from a cyclotron can, for example, efficiently produce Strontium-82, important for medical imaging. In addition, this work also has relevance to Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) technology, applied, for example, to driving thorium reactors, thus supporting the development of safe nuclear energy sources. A factor of 5-10 improvement in current would have a significant impact in these areas. The development and running of the front-end will include MIT undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. This will provide an excellent educational experience, with increased accelerator science at universities and more hardware experience for young scientists. Upon successful demonstration, the new front-end could be used in the IsoDAR (Isotope Decay-At-Rest) experiment which has the potential to advance our knowledge about sterile neutrinos and shed light on several anomalies observed with neutrinos.<br/><br/>The goal is to make use of RFQ injection of H2+ into a compact cyclotron. Each H2+  ion provides 2 protons after stripping thus reducing the necessary beam current by a factor of 2 and reducing space-charge forces, overcoming the limitations of injecting an intense proton beam into the cyclotron central region. The RFQ injection uses RF radiation in a quadrupole structure as a method to alleviate the ion source requirements by improving the bunching efficiency. The efficiency of the direct coupling of the RFQ to the spiral inflector injection channel of the cyclotron (a matter of bunch matching between the two accelerators) is a delicate part of system integration; it has to be demonstrated and is a goal of the project."

Nuclear pores, for example, the tiny channels in the nuclear envelope, are filled with a hydrogel that controls the selective exchange of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Another important biogel is mucus, made from highly hydrated biopolymers from a ombination of peptide and sugar subunits. Mucus coats all the wet surfaces in the human body, providing a selective barrier that allows nutrients and information in while keeping pathogens out. Hydrogels are an integral part of Biology and, yet, clear concepts of how they function are missing. The goal of this project is to elucidate the fundamental biophysical principles that allow biogels to act as selective barriers and filters, and the cellular mechanisms involved in building and regulating them. The project also will educate and engage community health leaders, teachers and students about the state-of-the-art science of hydrogels, emphasizing the importance of mucus barriers within the broader context of the Physics of nature's bio-materials. The research will also be the cornerstone for the development of free online teaching material, including a children's book and a video contest, enabling widespread public awareness and understanding of biological hydrogels. <br/><br/>The nuclear pore filter is an ideal system in which to elucidate general principles of biofiltration by hydrogels. Its molecular composition is well characterized, and can also be reconstituted from well-defined phenylalanine-rich repeat units. A unique suite of quantitativ methods and theoretical tools will be used to characterize selective transport and to elucidate the relationship between a particle's biochemical properties, and its mobility across nuclear pore hydrogel barriers. The project will also engineer hydrogel filters with a precise control of selected elements of the barrier, including the size, the charge, and the cross-link chemistry of the repeat units. The PI's aim is to substantially extend the already existing technology to study hydrogelbased filtering, and advance the field toward new frontiers, by addressing the function of repeat domains, the basic building blocks of many biological gels, in the regulation of barrier selectivity. Her goal is to provide the foundation for a theoretical framework that captures general principles governing selectivity in the nuclear pore, and likely also in other important biological hydrogels such as the mucus, and bacterial biofilms."

Electron transfer reactions are the simplest chemical reactions but have central roles in biological systems and in human-engineered devices that seek to harness solar energy as alternative sources.  The initial stages of plant photosynthesis are exquisitely engineered to transfer electrons across large distances, wasting as little energy as possible, in order to make high-energy molecules for later use.   The mitochondria in the cells of animals use an analogous ""reverse"" electron transfer pathway to synthesize molecules that allow muscle movement from high-energy precursors.   As we seek to mimic the effectiveness of plants in harnessing solar energy it is critical to understand electron transfer processes at a detailed level.  The rate of electron transfer depends on many quantities, but the factor that controls the distance- and orientation-dependence of the rate is called the ""electronic coupling element"", a quantity that has the potential to yield unprecedented control of rates if we can understand it at a fundamental level.  Cave and his coworkers   develop new methods for the calculation of the electronic coupling that are more accurate than existing approaches.  The new methods and results are used to better design new synthetic solar energy conversion devices and understand mechanisms of biological electron transfer.  The work is carried out Harvey Mudd College, an undergraduate institution.  The work provides an excellent educational opportunity for students likely to pursue graduate work in chemistry and also supports the annual presentation of a theoretical chemistry workshop to the Society of Women Engineers? On-Campus Day for high school women, where 100-150 high school women are introduced to opportunities in science, engineering and mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>Great strides have been made over the past two decades in developing diabatization techniques for extracting the electronic coupling from standard quantum chemical approaches.  However, because of the poor scaling of correlated quantum chemistry methods with system size one is often faced with the choice between accuracy and tractability, especially for large electron transfer systems.  Given the success of these diabatization methods, it is imperative to turn attention to developing new electronic structure theory approaches, tailored to the electron transfer problem, which are accurate and able to treat considerably larger systems.  This work addresses this challenge by developing a series of approximate methods that include correlation in a balanced fashion for all of the zeroth-order states relevant to the electron transfer process.  These approaches greatly extend the size of electron transfer systems for which the coupling can be obtained accurately and thus provide useful guidance about the suitability of more approximate methods.   In particular a family of correlated methods is developed to calculate the electronic coupling element based on approximations to the Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster approach.   The methods scale no worse than MP2/MBPT2, giving access to dramatically larger systems than available to CI or CCSD.  Use of PT-based coefficients in place of CCSD coefficients in the similarity transformed Hamiltonian, coupled with truncated excitation spaces tailored to electron transfer systems, lead to the increased scope and speed.  Tests of these new methods include a series of model systems where high-accuracy calculations can also be performed, application to calculate the electronic coupling in near-degenerate donor/acceptor and bridge systems, and the study of through-solvent electron transfer.  Both of the latter two computational targets have been studied experimentally."

One of these, gravity, appears to have a very different character than the others.   Surprisingly, however, research over the past twenty years has uncovered a surprising connection between theories that include the gravitational force and those that do not.   Most striking is the fact that important effects which are very difficult to study by conventional methods in one theory often become relatively simple when approached from the perspective of the so-called ""dual"" theory to which it is connected.  Professor Freedman's research focuses on developing new ways to understand black holes by exploiting these new connections.    He will also study certain non-trivial tests of these connections, verifying their internal mathematical consistency.   Thus, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science. Such research has also proven to be an excellent training ground for junior scientists who are interested in using sophisticated mathematics to describe real and potentially real applications.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.  This project will focus on the development of a detector based on liquid argon to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using the Liquid Argon Near Detector (Lar1ND) and the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. Both of these experiments will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos.   Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment.  There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence.  The PI's Group has broader impacts programs that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved<br/>undergraduate education;and increased public scientific literacy."

QCD is the theory governing the strong force responsible for the binding of protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei. QCD describes successfully a wide range of complex processes, from sub-nuclear interactions to macroscopic phenomena, such as the state of matter in the early Universe. In this context, the proton, one of components of the atomic nucleus, represents an ideal laboratory for studying the dynamical properties of QCD. This project will investigate theoretically non-perturbative quantities that encapsulate the dynamics of quarks and gluons within the proton. Ab initio calculations will be performed in Lattice QCD (LQCD), a rigorous framework for studying the proton structure that requires numerical solutions of the QCD equations on supercomputers. A graduate student will be engaged in cutting-edge fundamental research, ensuring his/her emergence as an independent researcher. The project will also support outreach activities promoting science to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This research program will undertake calculations within LQCD using state-of-the-art simulations and modern techniques. The simulations will be performed with quark masses fixed to their physical values, the latest achievement of the field. The class of observables that will be computed are the scalar, axial and tensor charges for both valence and sea quarks, as well as the axial and electromagnetic form factors. The scientific objectives are two-fold: Reproduce observables that are well-known experimentally, as a benchmark of the formalism, which will then allow for predictions of lesser-known or difficult to measure quantities; the latter is expected to impact New Physics searches. Quantities of the former kind are the axial and electromagnetic form factors, while quantities of the latter kind are the scalar and tensor interactions that could signal Physics beyond the Standard Model. The project aims at high-precision results and quantifiable systematics, so that the outcome of these computations yield high-credibility predictions of observables. This project will result in a better understanding of the proton structure, will be valuable for the interpretation and guidance of experiments, and may shed light on long-standing puzzles in nuclear physics, such as the proton spin."

This project consists of an experimental program to develop digital control, measurement, and feedback techniques for stabilizing the quantum state of a qubit formed from superconducting circuit elements. The program will move quantum control and feedback from the analog realm to the digital realm; all of the robustness associated with digital control in the classical regime should carry over to the quantum regime.

Each of these pulses provides a delta function-like kick to the qubit, inducing a complex trajectory on the Bloch sphere that is tailored to minimize leakage errors. In parallel, the team will employ a recently developed approach to qubit measurement based on the preparation of appropriate microwave cavity pointer states and microwave photon counting, combined with SFQ-based control, to implement low-latency feedback. This will provide a path to monitor and correct leakage out of the computational subspace, which is particularly damaging to proposed approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing.

By colliding protons at the  highest-ever energy in a controlled environment, we are learning how  symmetries are broken in nature and how the universe evolved from the earliest moments after the Big Bang to the present state billions of years later. The goal of particle physics is to understand the basic laws of how fundamental particles, like electrons and quarks, interact with one another and how their collective dynamics shape the universe.  Experimental results provided by the LHC are the essential ingredient to sort through all the possible models that could describe the universe and focus on those which give us a deeper and better  understanding of what we observe.  In addition to the LHC, the  experimental program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at  Brookhaven National Laboratory probes the early-universe behavior of quarks and gluons, which formed a hot dense plasma before cooling as the universe expanded, leading to the creation of protons, neutrons and in turn atoms and molecules. Here, the relevant theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is needed with ever-higher precision to predict how this transition occurred.  As part of this project, Professors Hetrick and Holland will investigate new physics models which potentially elucidate the properties of the Higgs boson, whose relatively light mass is an unexplained mystery.  They will also study QCD and similar models, using computer simulations for better insight into strongly-interacting systems.  This work is therefore aligned with the national interest in that it reinforces the progress of fundamental science in the United States.   This work also has a significant broader impact, giving undergraduate students at the University of the Pacific an opportunity to work on modern-day research, such as learning numerical  simulation techniques. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Holland will be studying strongly-interacting composite Higgs models, which postulate a new gauge force analogous to QCD. In such theories, the Higgs boson emerges as a bound state, much like a pion forms via the strong binding of quarks. Such models could explain why the Higgs boson is relatively light if the new gauge theory has near-conformal behavior.  This leads to predictions of additional bound states that should be observed at the LHC, which are now reaching to the level of being detected or ruled out.   Like QCD, such models require numerical lattice simulations on supercomputers in order to make reliable predictions.  Professor Hetrick will be working on an alternate idea in which the properties of the Higgs boson emerge from a higher-dimensional theory via the Hosotani mechanism, where particular boundary conditions break the symmetry.  Again, numerical computations are needed to test such theories and compare them against current experimental results.  Both Professors Holland and Hetrick will also be studying properties of QCD as well, such as how the theory simplifies as the symmetry is increased, as well as providing technical support for the sharing of numerical resources across the international research community."

These theories often lead to testable predictions in experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was built in order to search for undiscovered particles and to study their properties.  The LHC is best known for the discovery of the Higgs boson, a particle whose existence is related to the origin of the masses of the other known elementary particles.

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award is to support the NSF-funded DarkSide (DS) groups for the construction and operation of DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), a direct WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 tons (20 tons).<br/><br/>The LAr TPC relies heavily on the utilization of argon obtained from underground sources, or UAr. The planned Aria project for UAr purification may improve the worldwide availability of valuable stable rare isotopes such as O-18, N-15, and C-13, used for various medical, industrial and energy generation applications. The production of hundreds of tonnes of low-radioactivity UAr for DS-20k and for other technical uses requiring detection of Ar-37 for nuclear test ban verification, and Ar-39, for radiometric dating. Special E&O programs are planned with focus on educating K-12 teachers about basic physics and how it relates to dark matter detection, re-starting a summer school experience for high-school and undergraduate students, as well giving research opportunities to undergraduate students at participating underrepresented-minority serving institutions.<br/><br/>DS-20k builds on the success of DarkSide-50 (DS-50), operating at LNGS since 2013, which produced two zero-background science results using atmospheric argon (AAr) and then underground argon (UAr) fills. DS-50 demonstrated an 39Ar reduction of 1400 in the UAr. Electron recoil (ER) background was shown to be completely suppressed in the region of interest, with discrimination better than 1 part in 1.5 x 10^7. These results demonstrated the ability of large LAr TPCs to operate in an ""instrumental background-free mode"" - a mode in which less than <0.1 events (other than actual nuclear recoils from elastic scattering of atmospheric and diffuse supernova background neutrinos) are expected in the region of interest for the planned exposure of DS-20k. DS-20k will have ultra-low backgrounds, with the ability to measure its backgrounds in situ, and sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 1.2 x 10^-47 cm2 (1.1 x 10^-46 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run with exposure of 100 t yr.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since dark matter has only been observed through its gravitational effects, there is a wide range of possible dark matter candidates, and a large number of direct and indirect searches for dark matter interactions with standard model particles. Axions and axion-like particles are prominent dark matter candidates: they are predicted to exist by string-theory-inspired extensions of the Standard Model, are hinted at by a number of astrophysical phenomena, and, in the case of the QuantumChromoDynamic axion, offer an elegant solution to the strong-Charge-Parity problem. In addition, discovery of light axion-like dark matter may provide insights into the earliest epochs of the universe, specifically the energy scale of inflation. The experimental search funded by this award has the potential to shed light on these important puzzles. This award integrates research and outreach by developing a program designed to spark interest in science among young students and the general public, and to teach problem solving skills and strategies that are better-suited to complex real-world challenges. This program will include creating a collection of non-standard conceptual physics problems that will be made available to physics educators and the broad public via the world-wide-web.<br/><br/>This award will provide funds for a direct experimental search for light axion dark matter, via the axion-photon interaction. This interaction between axion dark matter and the azimuthal magnetization of a magnetized ferrite toroid creates an axial magnetic field, oscillating at the axion Compton frequency. A SQUID magnetometer is inductively coupled to the sample in order to detect this field. Both non-resonant and resonant coupling schemes will be explored, in order to find the optimal search strategy for this experimental design. The apparatus will be placed inside a liquid helium cryostat, and superconducting magnetic shielding will be used to screen external electromagnetic interference. The experiment targets a very broad range of axion masses between ~ 10^-16 eV and 10^-8 eV. The experimental sensitivity reach extends several orders of magnitude beyond existing bounds on axion-photon interaction, exploring the range of couplings that are favored by a number of astrophysical observations, such as the transparency of the universe to TeV photons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon.  Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging.  This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."

The physical properties are determined by parameters like the molecular spacing, degree of order, and orientation. These parameters are typically fixed by self-assembly into the equilibrium crystal state and can only be changed by synthesizing a new batch of materials. This award supports research to use optical trapping methods to prepare molecular assemblies where these parameters can be tuned by external fields. This capability will permit the study of basic properties of solid-state materials in a cheaper, more flexible way. Polar molecules will be trapped in optical lattices, mimicking the molecular arrangement and properties of a solid crystal, and be oriented using external electric fields. Such a lattice configuration renders systematic tuning and exploration of relevant properties of solids feasible. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to explore novel quantum phenomena, like collective optical response, in such systems. In the future, this research has the potential to inform the synthesis of real molecular materials, from molecular crystals to nanocrystal assemblies to metal-organic frameworks. It provides a new approach to ""crystal engineering"" by combining advances in Physics, Chemistry and Materials Science. The project's broader impacts include student training in various areas, including lasers, vacuum technology and optical setups, as well as providing a broader, interdisciplinary research experience than typically accessible. Finally, regular visits to K-12 schools to present experimental demonstrations and lectures on trapping and manipulating particles, e.g. molecules or ions, will be part of this research effort.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to load a quantum degenerate gas of polar AlCl molecules into an optical lattice to study novel quantum phases and simulate solid-state crystalline materials. This research has four specific goals: First, perform precision measurements of molecular properties, such as the energy spectrum and the Franck-Condon factors of AlCl; Second, cool the polar AlCl molecules to quantum degeneracy and study the dynamics and stability of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The group will also explore correlated phases due to the anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction, including liquid crystal and density-wave phases, and probe the interplay between superfluidity and charge-ordering in low-dimensional materials; Third, create a one-dimensional optical lattice of polar molecules and study its non-linear optical response by measuring the second harmonic generation. By varying temperature and ordering, the optical lattice can be tuned from the limit of independent, noninteracting molecules to a strongly correlated one-dimensional crystal; Fourth, use Raman scattering to explore the transition from intramolecular vibrations of noninteracting molecules to intermolecular phonon structure by continuously tuning the lattice parameters. The experiments will demonstrate that ordered structures of diatomic molecules can exhibit phenomena that are directly relevant to solid-state materials. These results will motivate future experiments to expand the lattice to two dimensions and finally to fully mimic three-dimensional crystal systems.

Size control optimizes fitness under variable environmental conditions in unicellular species, and is critical for proper organ development and maintenance in multi-cellular organisms. In humans, disruption of the networks that control cell growth, division or size is linked to many diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. In budding yeast, size is modulated by nutrients. Cells grow fast and are large in rich nutrients and slowly and are small in poor nutrients. The PI will use a unique combination of state-of-the-art quantitative imaging methods, genetic manipulation, and mathematical modeling to construct a systems-level framework for cell size homeostasis in budding yeast. These studies will answer the longstanding question: How do cells know when they are big enough to divide? Application of the approach proposed here to other important cell state transitions will provide the foundation for the development in the private sector of new products or processes for in-tissue engineering and drug discovery. The proposed project provides highly interdisciplinary graduate training in biology, genetic engineering, physics, computation and mathematics. The Royer group hosts a large number of undergraduate students as part of the CBIS Undergraduate Research Program, the BCBP Summer internship program for predominantly minority institutions and the CBIS High School Scholars Program. Students participating in these programs will experience a ""real life"" application of their knowledge. The uniquely broad set of skills implicated in the research will help to prepare them for the increasingly interdisciplinary word of science and technology. The PI as Director of the RPI Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Biophysics will organize outreach to four-year colleges in the Northeast and to the public annually during Biophysics week.<br/><br/>The hypothesis is that the transcription factors which activate the G1/S regulon leading to commitment to division, differentially and dynamically integrate nutrient signals to coordinate growth and division, thereby enabling adaptive nutrient modulation of cell size. This project has three specific objectives: i) Map the G1/S transcriptional activator nuclear organization at super-resolution as a function of size and nutrients, ii) Measure and model nutrient dependent Start dynamics, and iii) Define the upstream signaling pathways and targets for nutrient modulation of cell size. Despite the identification of literally hundreds of genes implicated in size control in budding yeast, it remains a mystery how this complex genetic network impacts the Start machinery to control size. The PI will move beyond the qualitative genetic characterization of the size control network to a quantitative understanding of how this network dynamically processes information. The strategy that will be used by the PI will provide a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of a complex biological state transition, commitment to division. The measurements of Start factor concentration and super-resolution localization will identify the key parameters for nutrient control of cell size. The mathematical models will serve as a conceptual framework for testing hypotheses, and will inform physical principles of cell division in higher organisms, including humans. Finally, the results will reveal the impact of cell-to-cell heterogeneity, or biological noise, on cell growth and the dynamics of commitment to division and size homeostasis. This work will provide the foundation for a rigorous understanding of how evolution has shaped molecular networks to cope with a stochastic environment and how robust cellular decision-making is established.

This project seeks to build upon these studies to demonstrate reservoir engineering techniques for state preparation, manipulation and quantum control of a multifunctional hybrid system that interfaces ultracold atoms and silicon carbide defect qubits within a MEMS-based optomechanical resonator. In addition to elucidating universal principles governing reservoir-engineered open quantum systems, this multifunctional hybrid system will also be used to demonstrate quantum-enhanced metrology in a scalable, integrated platform. <br/><br/>The multifunctional hybrid quantum system leverages unique capabilities of this team including (i) fundamental conceptual advances in the use of reservoir-engineering techniques to create topologically protected forms of entanglement in an open quantum system, (ii) expertise in strong coupling of ultracold quantum spins to MEMS-based optomechanical resonators for spin-mediated control and sensing, (iii) expertise in fabrication of high quality single crystal silicon carbide optomechanical resonators, (iv) expertise in the deterministic placement and control of silicon carbide defect centers. The achievement of augmented strain coupling between defect qubits and optomechanical MEMS devices will enable the stabilization, state readout and dissipation control of the hybrid system.

These so-called ""conformal field theories"" are crucial for understanding diverse phenomena ranging from the behavior of materials such as those used in the semiconductor industry to the physics underlying the microscopic (quantum-mechanical) nature of gravity.  Because the interaction scales are so diverse, these theories cannot be described using conventional theoretical tools, and this project is aimed at developing improved theoretical tools in order to achieve a better understanding of these systems.   This research advances the national interest by furthering our basic scientific knowledge of systems that are likely to have numerous broad-ranging applications.   This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.

He also intends to promote the public understanding of science through efforts to make the scientific literature broadly available to the public at large.<br/>  <br/>More technically, Professor Morrison will investigate supersymmetric conformal field theories in dimensions four and six by using F theory and the algebraic geometry of elliptic fibrations.  F-theory is a variant of a superstring theory which relies heavily on constructions from algebraic geometry (in mathematics) to produce desired physical effects.  Professor Morrison will use algebraic geometry to develop new F-theory tools and improve our understanding of six-dimensional conformal field theories in this way.  He will also utilize a general method for producing four-dimensional theories from six-dimensional ones, adapting that method to the F theory context."

The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed dark matter. Particle physics suggests that dark matter comprises relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds. The motion of the Earth through the galaxy produces a head-wind of WIMPs. The angular distribution of recoils from WIMP interactions has a ~100% asymmetry, and is modulated at the sidereal rate on account of the Earth's rotation. No known background can mimic this signal. <br/><br/>The practical implications of the technology being developed for such searches have promising applications to low background alpha and neutron measurements. This work also includes the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.<br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment leads the field of directional dark matter detection. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's sensitivity to this modulated signature, which provides a unique window into one of the most important questions in science today.

In coming years, the LHC will explore even smaller scales and with improved accuracy. Combining these results with results from complimentary terrestrial and astrophysical experiments, particle physicists will hunt for new particles and forces.

In particular, Professors Bigi, Delgado, and Martin focus on investigating what new phenomena may exist, how we might measure it at the LHC or in other experiments, and how it can be connected to pressing questions such as the identity of dark matter or why there is more matter than antimatter. Specific directions to be explored include effective field theory, new LHC searches, and flavor physics. This work is also envisioned to have broad impact in that it will guide future experimental searches and involve close collaboration with experimenters, both locally and at the CERN laboratory where the LHC is located.

Professor Delgado will explore novel resonances signals at the LHC, both in the context of simplified models and from a ""clockwork"" dimension. Together, Professors Martin and Delgado will explore models of Dirac supersymmetry and investigate novel ways to hunt for dark matter, such as through interference in visible final states at the LHC or in high nuclear-recoil bins of direct-detection experiments.  Professor Bigi will continue his work investigating the effects of new physics in flavor-violating processes.

Understanding the nature of this ""dark matter"" is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.  Primordial black holes (PBH's) are fascinating dark-matter candidates.  PBH's could have formed in the infant Universe, before the first stars even existed.  Professor Ali-Haimoud aims to develop tests of PBH's by predicting their effect on maps of the early Universe and examining the gravitational waves they would emit, and by comparing these predictions with observations. In addition, he will develop a novel way to study the initial conditions of the Universe by quantifying their impact on certain cosmological phase transitions.  As such, this research serves the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science in the United States.  This research will also have significant broader impacts.  Professor Ali-Haimoud will include the results of this research in his graduate and undergraduate physics courses and will also directly engage students in these investigations.  In addition, he will develop a course for underserved New York City high-school students on the physics of sailing in which he hopes to foster enthusiasm for physics by drawing parallels between sailing and gravitational waves and black holes. <br/><br/>More specifically, the first and main focus of this research is to establish robust limits on the abundance of PBH's of about one to one thousand solar masses through their impact on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and especially their gravitational-wave signals for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).  Professor Ali-Haimoud will extend his analytic calculations of the merger rate of PBH binaries to realistic mass distributions, estimate the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background accounting for high eccentricities, and establish through numerical simulation whether PBH binaries formed in the early Universe are significantly affected by non-linear structures.  He will also extend his work on CMB limits by estimating the self-consistent luminosity of accreting PBH's, and by studying the nature of accretion (spherical vs. disk-like).  The second project involves exploring an entirely new idea:  the impact of small-scale baryon perturbations on the global recombination history.  This effect can probe the currently unconstrained small-scale baryon isocurvature perturbation.  Professor Ali-Haimoud will explore this idea quantitatively by studying perturbed radiative transfer in the Lyman-alpha line during recombination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will study the dynamics of QFT's in various dimensions, a topic of fundamental importance since QFT's provide a general framework through which physicists study subjects ranging from the behavior of the elementary particles to the physics of condensed matter.   Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will approach this problem from multiple perspectives, including the use of string-theoretic tools. They will also investigate the entanglement of quantum states --- a mysterious phenomenon that has bearing on diverse topics such as quantum computing and strange new phases of matter.

This research also has significant broader impact components.  Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates in their research, providing ideal training to junior physicists entering research in this field.  This research project will also strengthen the close collaboration between City College and Lehman College. Maintaining a joint research program has had a positive impact on attracting students to these research areas, especially from minority and underrepresented groups which constitute a large part of the student body at both colleges.

These three forces are the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force (which is responsible for radioactive nuclear decays), and the strong nuclear force (which holds atomic nuclei together).  The fourth fundamental force, gravity, stands as the notable exception.  The discovery of gauge theories is undoubtably one of the great scientific achievements of the 20th century, crucial not only for our modern understanding of elementary particle physics but also for vast swaths of modern geometry and topology.  Yet many foundational questions about the dynamics of gauge theory remain poorly understood.  These questions have bearing on such topics as the structure of the proton, the character of dark matter and dark energy, or even the mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity.  Professor Beasley will conduct research to develop new mathematical methods and tools, inspired by string theory, for analyzing a special class of gauge theories defined in two spatial dimensions. These gauge theories preserve supersymmetry, which relates particles of different spins to each other and is among the possible extensions of the Standard Model now being tested in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  The project will also have significant broader impacts.  Substantial portions of the project involve joint work between Professor Beasley and his graduate students.  The project thereby serves to train the next generation of mathematical physicists in the methods of quantum field theory and string theory, as well as to disseminate those methods more broadly throughout the mathematical community.  Professor Beasley will also give a series of popular scientific talks for first-year undergraduates, will supervise junior and senior mathematics majors in a Research Capstone, and will videotape his lectures in a graduate course on quantum field theory for mathematicians.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Beasley will study perturbative and non-perturbative properties of supersymmetric Wilson loop operators associated to Legendrian knots in contact three-manifolds.  He will investigate a relation between these operators and infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras known to occur in two-dimensional quantum field theory, as well as a new localization method for Feynman integrals.  Professor Beasley will also construct a novel, time-dependent topological supersymmetry on three-manifolds which fiber over the circle.  These ingredients will be applied to perform a variety of exact computations in gauge theory.  The project invokes deep notions from contact geometry and topology, and so will establish further interdisciplinary connections between theoretical physics and mathematics."

These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."

The resulting theory is called ""quantum gravity"" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of the project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in.<br/><br/>James Hartle will continue exploring the interface between quantum mechanics and cosmology. He will work on extending the predictions of the no-boundary quantum state of the universe for observations today to increasingly general and detailed situations. He will further develop the generalizations of quantum mechanics that are necessary for cosmology and investigate cosmologically motivated extensions of quantum mechanics. He proposes to continue to refine our understanding of the origin of the quasiclassical realm of every day experience as an emergent feature of our quantum universe. Gary Horowitz will investigate a variety of topics in classical and quantum gravity, focussing on singularities and the origin of spacetime. He will explore whether classical singularities can be visible, or must always be hidden behind event horizons. He will also examine a recently discovered connection between potential visible singularities and charged matter. In addition, Horowitz will study how spacetime geometry emerges from a holographic theory of quantum gravity. He will consider the roll of quantum entanglement, but also pursue a new direction based on special cross-sections of the boundary at infinity. Don Marolf will explore a variety of issues in classical and quantum gravity generally related to black holes, thermodynamics, and entropy. While there is already much evidence that black holes are in some sense thermal systems (with entropy proportional to their surface area), and while this is expected to hold deep and fundamental lessons for physics, the argument has not yet been made in complete generality. Marolf will explore the required extensions and the resulting implications. Another part of his work seeks to more deeply understand so-called holographic descriptions of gravity, where phenomena in a dynamical spacetime are in fact equivalent to the quantum physics of a seemingly very different non-gravitating system. In this regard, Marolf is particularly interested in understanding the dictionary that allows one to translate physics inside black holes into the language of the non-gravitating formulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe. Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted.  Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass. <br/><br/>CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is an experiment to search for NLDBD in the isotope 130-Te and is currently being built at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. CUORE is an array of TeO2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. The crystals act as both the source and the absorbing calorimetric material. These kinds of detectors offer good energy resolution and efficiencies and are well-suited for NLDBD searches. <br/><br/>This award will enable the PI to continue to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate on the CUORE experiment. This will involve tasks such as monitoring the gluing of thermistors and heaters on the 988 crystals, helping to assemble the calibration system and elements of the electronics and assisting with cryostat alignment, with tests of the various subsystems of the detector and with cryostat cool down or warm up diagnostics. This will give students invaluable experience working with a cutting-edge physics experiment in a world-class underground laboratory. <br/><br/>An exciting sector of public outreach that Cal Poly will pursue is to develop an interactive visualization scheme for CUORE physics. This software will serve as a channel for the public to gain insight into the scientific process and explore the mysteries of particle physics. Through Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education they will help local teachers develop project-based-learning modules for high school physics courses that incorporate the underlying physics of CUORE."

This goal is increasingly becoming achievable thanks to the progress in recent years in cooling and trapping molecules and controlled manipulation of their interactions at temperatures close to absolute zero. The fundamental question of how chemical reactions proceed at a collision energy close to absolute zero can now be explored both by experiment and theory. Such controlled manipulation of atoms and molecules is an integral part of current research in quantum technologies, including quantum information processing and quantum computing. Theoretical studies of molecular encounters in this area face significant obstacles as computations become intractable when all relevant quantum states and external field effects are included. The goal of this NSF award is to develop and implement new methodologies to study ultracold chemical reactions with full quantum state resolution of both reactants and products. The research may lead to new computational programs capable of describing chemical reactions at ultracold temperatures. The research crosses disciplinary boundaries in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and astrophysics and develops a highly skilled science and engineering workforce. <br/><br/>An ultimate goal in chemistry is the complete control of quantum states of both reactants and products with high selectivity and specificity.  The quantum state resolution applies both to the internal states of the molecules and the angular momentum partial waves involved in the collision process. Restricting partial waves requires reducing the collision energy to a kelvin or below for most molecular systems. Even in this regime, electronically non-adiabatic and geometric phase effects play an important role in governing the outcome of a chemical reaction. However, such processes remain largely unexplored in the utracold regime. The main goal of this NSF Award is to develop new methodologies and computer codes to study electronically non-adiabatic effects in chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A quantitative description of their collisions and interactions requires a quantum mechanical approach, but it is computationally challenging for many molecules of interest to current cooling and trapping experiments. The primary difficulty is the proliferation in the number of quantum states and degrees of freedom to be included in the calculations and the sensitivity of results to both short-range and long-range intermolecular forces. This work will develop new theoretical and computational tools that go beyond existing models for the treatment of chemical reactions at temperatures below 1 degree Kelvin. It will significantly enhance theoretical capabilities for the description of chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures and provide an efficient tool for quantized studies of chemical reactions at low temperatures. The proposed research transcends disciplinary boundaries, and the computational algorithms developed will also be equally applicable to molecular processes in diverse environments ranging from atmospheric chemistry to astrophysics.  Funding of this project will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and Technology.<br/><br/>This project deals with the development of accurate and efficient methods to study chemical reactions and energy transfer in cold molecular collisions. The full Close-Coupling (CC) method will continue to be developed and optimized. A hybrid method that uses full CC at short range and Multi-Channel Quantum Defect Theory (MQDT) at long range will also be developed and benchmarked. These methods will be applied to a number of reactions including F + H2 and OH + H. In addition, the PI will explore the importance of the geometric phase in chemical reaction dynamics using the O + OH reaction at the ultracold limit as a illustrative case."

Accurate measurements from the LHC experiments brought high-energy physics to a new realm of precision that allows us to deepen our knowledge of the structure of matter and its elementary constituents and to shed light on possible new physics interactions.  This field of research is vibrant and its rapid progress is of high importance for the national interest as it promotes advances of fundamental science that are crucial for new discoveries. Theoretical and experimental analyses at the unprecedented energies of the LHC demand precision.  This is essential for meaningful comparisons between theory and experiment and a correct interpretation of the results.  In his research, Professor Guzzi aims to calculate precise theoretical predictions and use efficient methods for phenomenology to improve our current knowledge of the structure of the proton and set stringent tests on the Standard Model of the elementary particles, as well as search for new particle signatures predicted by theories of new physics.  The proposed research also has significant broader impacts:  Professor Guzzi will involve students in his research, give public lectures on his research results, and develop new course curricula based on the results of his research.<br/><br/>On the technical side, Professor Guzzi will use precise theory predictions for kinematic distributions of top-quark pairs produced at the LHC to reduce the uncertainties associated with parton distribution functions (PDF's). PDF's of the proton map out the longitudinal momentum distribution of its constituent quarks and gluons and they are a crucial limiting factor in the accuracy of theoretical predictions for many important observables at the LHC. A second part of the proposed project aims to improve the theory predictions for searches for extra neutral vector bosons at the LHC, generically referred to as Z' bosons. They differ from the Standard-Model Z boson by having different masses and couplings. With the improvements of the proton PDF's discussed above and with new precise measurements of dilepton pair production in Drell-Yan processes at LHC Run-II energies and luminosities, Professor Guzzi will study the parameter space of Z's of generic origin and will scrutinize a large number of new physics models. Finally, Professor Guzzi will determine with high precision the nonperturbative parameters of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions of the proton by using high-order perturbation theory and recent precise LHC measurements for Z-boson production in terms of a novel angular variable that has the advantage of being very sensitive to nonperturbative effects. TMD distributions represent the ultimate frontier of factorization theorems in QCD and allow us to have a unified framework in which to describe hadronic reactions in different energy regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those parameters are called ""little a"" and ""little b"", and they are related to the momentum of the decay products and to the strength of the radioactive decay.  The experiment will be done with the Nab spectrometer that is presently being installed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This project also prepares the way for an extension of the program, in which two more parameters, A and B, can be determined. The precise measurement of these parameters furthers a better understanding of the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The goal of this experimental program is to test the Standard Model of particles and interactions in regions that were inaccessible before, or not as precise. A discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model would have important implications for nuclear and particle physics, as well as cosmology.  The project will have a valuable impact on higher education:  most of the work will be done by students at undergraduate and graduate levels, and these students will learn valuable skills and experiences for their future careers. <br/><br/>More specifically, the motivation for the experimental program for the Nab experiment is to (1) determine the ratio of the coupling constants in free neutron beta decay, lambda =g_V/g_A, with unprecedented precision, (2) to contribute to a test of the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and (3) to search for non-Standard Model (SM) forms of weak interaction that manifest themselves as scalar and/or tensor interactions, that is, which interact with fermions with the ""wrong"" helicity. The current Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science devotes a paragraph to this effort. The studies are performed by the Nab collaboration, of which the PI is the experiment manager and the DOE project manager. The award supports the specific contributions of the PI and his group, the most important of which are the characterization of the superconducting magnet, the assembly and characterization of the spectrometer vacuum system, high voltage and main electrodes, and the characterization of the efficiency of the proton detection in a dedicated proton source.   The PI is responsible for the development of the present main analysis method for Nab. In addition, the PI will work on the planning of the future program, which is the analysis of uncertainties for the ""A"" and ""B"" coefficients, and the preliminary design and prototype testing of a novel supermirror polarizer concept that would minimize the leading systematic uncertainty in those measurements. The project will have a valuable impact on higher education. Several undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable research experience working on the proposed projects. The PI is strongly committed to attracting members of underrepresented groups, to help broaden the human resource base of the field.

However, string theories generally require that there exist extra dimensions beyond those of width, length, and height.   Such extra dimensions must be rolled into very small spaces, and the shapes of these spaces determine which elementary particles are predicted by string theory.  For these reasons, it is important to understand the detailed shapes of these extra dimensions.  Likewise, combining Einstein's theory of gravity with quantum mechanics involves a hypothetical particle --- the so-called ""graviton""  --- which transmits gravitational interactions and carries two units of spin.  However, string theory can also give rise to remarkable extensions of Einstein's theory which involve higher-spin analogues of the graviton.   For these reasons, string theory can have profound consequences for early-universe physics.  In their research, Professors Becker, Becker, and Sezgin aim to investigate these and other fundamental questions involving the connections between string theory, gravity, and higher-spin theories.

Immune cells such as T cells and B cells use surface receptors to directly engage other cells as they search for molecular signatures of pathogens. An emerging paradigm in immunology is that forces at the cell surface regulate antigen recognition and cell activation. Understanding antigen recognition by T cells and B cells remains one of the most significant unresolved issues in immunology. This project will contribute to fundamental immunological understanding and provide mechanistic guidance for designing immuno-modulatory materials and therapies. The project will leverage a recent initiative to increase the number of Tennesseans with college degrees by engaging high school and community college students in active learning modules. Additionally, first-year undergraduates will be targeted with a new seminar on physical biology, and an emphasis will be placed on engaging students from Tennessee's Appalachian region. These efforts will help to recruit new students into science and engineering, and will expose a broad range of students to the interface of physics and biology. All research students will be involved in educational activities. A graduate student will spend time embedded in an experimental lab, and a workshop organized by the PI will bring theorists and experimentalists together to explore the physical regulation of immune cells. <br/><br/>This project will investigate processes that are essential for a proper immune response. It will resolve how membrane and cytoskeletal forces couple with force-dependent dissociation kinetics to influence the dynamics of T cell receptors, elucidate mechanical processes that enhance the ability of B cells to discriminate between and internalize membrane-presented antigens, and characterize how dynamic membrane protrusions on the T cell surface impact the antigen search process. Investigating these processes will result in a new computational framework that can be used to address other emerging questions in immunology and cellular bio-mechanics. Many physical features of antigen recognition are difficult to explore experimentally, and there is no framework for systematically investigating the underlying mechanisms. This project will address this gap by developing computational and theoretical approaches that capture important biophysical interactions at cell-cell interfaces, including stochastic receptor-ligand binding kinetics, membrane mechanics, and actin-mediated forces on the membrane. Such approaches are essential for understanding antigen recognition, as they allow systematic investigation of physical features that are experimentally inaccessible. The computational framework will generate hypotheses that can be experimentally tested, thus providing feedback between theory and experiment. Receptor-mediated interactions between cells are ubiquitous in biology, and as such, the approaches developed in this proposal can be used to study diverse biological phenomena extending far beyond immunology.

Neutrinos are light, fast-moving particles produced in stellar environment via cosmic radiation and in nuclear decay processes, but they interact so weakly that many of their properties remain mysterious.  At colliders, and especially now at the Large Hadron Collider, familiar particles impact with sufficient ferocity to recreate conditions of the early universe.  Through its gravitational effects, dark matter is known to represent a quarter of the energy of the universe, but we have never directly observed the particle or particles of which this dark matter is made.  Connecting each of these efforts is a desire to better understand the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions.  Thus, research in this area advances the national interest by fostering the progress of basic science.  Professors Dent and Walker will develop new physical models, propose improved search strategies, contribute software tools, and interpret constraints imposed by new observations. Significant broader impacts are realized through the close supervision of undergraduate research students at Sam Houston State University, a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a diverse student population.  Professors Dent and Walker are dedicated to providing an environment that develops the analytical, numerical, and creative skills of their students through participation in journal publications and conference presentations and by creating a foundation for graduates to thrive in doctoral programs at major research universities.<br/><br/>More specifically, the process of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (observed for the first time in 2017) will be used to place limits on physics beyond the Standard Model, including short-baseline oscillations induced by a massive sterile neutrino, and on non-standard interactions in the light-mediator and effective field theory contexts.  In support of these goals, Professors Dent and Walker serve as theory advisors with the Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER) collaboration, contributing analysis and interpretation.  At the Large Hadron Collider, since new physics beyond the Standard Model is not yet manifest in obvious ways, the community must shift attention to processes which may be kinematically concealed, which require large statistics for discrimination, or which are intrinsically rare.  This proposal advances that worldwide effort via direct analysis and by contributing public software and algorithmic tools, including the development of a new scale-invariant jet-clustering algorithm.  Toward the goal of discerning the nature of dark matter, Professors Dent and Walker will investigate the capacity for current and future attempts at direct detection to characterize dark-matter properties such as mass, spin, and non-gravitational interactions, including the effects of an irreducible neutrino background.  This study will also extend to more general dark-sector frameworks, including the wide variety of experiments designed to search for such particles, especially in the sub-GeV mass range.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We live in a region where inflation has ended, and other such regions with diverse properties are constantly being formed.  Professor Vilenkin will develop methods to test this multiverse theory observationally.   As part of this research, Professor Vilenkin will also study possible observational signatures of cosmic strings.  Cosmic strings are very thin and highly energetic linear objects.  Many models of particle physics predict that such strings must have formed in the early universe, and if so they can produce a variety of effects which are observable at the present time.  In particular, such strings could be responsible for cosmic rays at the highest energies, which are hard to explain through conventional astrophysical processes.  A detection of cosmic strings would be of great importance, as it would open a unique window into the physics of very high energies, inaccessible in particle accelerators.  As such, this research is in the national interest by furthering the development of basic science in the United States.  Professor Vilenkin will also continue his efforts to communicate these ideas to the general public.  <br/><br/>At a more technical level, the predictions of the multiverse model will be explored using the powerful statistical methods developed by Professor Vilenkin and his collaborators.

It is the basis of special relativity and implies that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  However, attempts to unify our two most fundamental descriptions of nature, the Standard Model of particle physics and general relativity, into a single all-encompassing theory suggest that Lorentz invariance might be broken slightly.  The research of Professor Mewes focuses on violations of Lorentz invariance, with the goal of extending the theoretical description of Lorentz-invariance violations and identifying experimental signatures in an effort to aid the search for new physics. This research advances the national interest by promoting science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  Parts of this work will be accessible to undergraduates and will provide research opportunities for physics majors at Cal Poly, a primarily undergraduate institution.  Students involved in this research will also gain valuable exposure to theoretical physics.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project seeks to fill several major gaps in the theoretical framework known as the Standard-Model-Extension (SME). The SME provides a general description of Lorentz violation in any system. The generality of this approach implies that the full SME contains an infinite number of violations. To keep the problem tractable, early studies focused on the minimal SME, which restricts attention to operators of renormalizable mass dimension.  However, there are reasons to suspect that nonrenormalizable violations may dominate. This project will extend our understanding of Lorentz-invariance violations by completing the extension for linearized gravity and by exploring various consequences in that sector. It also seeks to fill gaps in the Lorentz-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics by classifying violations in fermion-photon interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neutrinos have very small mass and zero electric charge so they could be their own anti-particle. If that is the case, this might explain why there is more matter than anti-matter. The only experimentally feasible way to answer this question is to look for neutrinoless double beta decay (NLDBD), a very rare form of nuclear decay. This award will support a project that adds to and brings together the best U.S. (Majorana Demonstrator) and European (GERDA) experiments using germanium to look for neutrinoless double beta decay into a new experiment called LEGEND-200.  The experiment will use 200 kg of special detectors made out of enriched germanium and will take place at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy.  Among the fields that may benefit from the new technology developed as part of the experiment are:  environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities.  Students and postdocs will be trained in underground science related disciplines, such as low-background techniques, detector technology, nuclear physics and neutrino physics. <br/><br/>The current generation Ge-76 experiments, GERDA and the Majorana Demonstrator (MJD), utilizing high purity Germanium detectors with an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.12%, have achieved the lowest backgrounds by over an order of magnitude in the NLDBD signal region compared to other NLDBD experiments.   Building on this success, the LEGEND Collaboration is developing a next-generation NLDBD experiment with discovery potential at a half-life of 1028 years.   This award provides mid-scale support for U.S. involvement in building and commissioning an  almost-next-generation NLDBD experiment using up to 200 kg of Ge-76 diodes ie LEGEND-200 (L-200) that has potential to deliver physics and serve as a forerunner to a future ton-scale experiment.   L-200 is based on combining the techniques developed by MJD to produce ultra-clean components and GERDA's background suppression from shielding the detectors in a liquid argon bath, in addition to physically combining the existing MJD and GERDA detectors, resources and infrastructure with new detectors.  L-200 will be based at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy, and deploy the detectors in the existing GERDA cryostat.

Rydberg atoms within an ultracold gas move very slowly, resulting in long collision times and large cumulative effects of even very weak interatomic forces. The large spatial extent of the Rydberg electron also renders the Rydberg atom sensitive to local field environments. The combination of these two factors, slow speed and large spatial volume, makes ultracold Rydberg atoms ideal probes of delicate correlations and other novel phenomena within the ultracold environment. During the past few years, experimental progress in preparing and manipulating ultracold Rydberg atoms has led to many new developments in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics. For example, Rydberg atoms have made possible the detection of a new class of long-range molecules, the so-called ""trilobite""-like molecules, and of fast quantum gates relevant to the quantum information revolution. They are now utilized to make small regions of an otherwise opaque gas transparent, using what is known as electromagnetically induced transparency. Rydberg atoms can also generate single photon sources and mediate photon-photon interactions. Accordingly, ultracold Rydberg atom research bridges AMO, condensed matter and mesoscopic physics, and quantum information science, as well as ultracold chemistry. This theory project models the interactions of Rydberg electrons with their environment in order to better understand and predict observed spectra, which are expected to depend sensitively on the distribution of atoms in the gas, and enhance their utilization in the range of areas mentioned above. <br/><br/>This research program explores how Rydberg electrons can be used to investigate few- and many-body phenomena. Rydberg electrons provide a low-energy and well-localized probe for AMO, condensed-matter, and chemical systems. While their wave function extends to large volumes, Rydberg electrons, being excited near the ionization threshold, have a small kinetic energy that minimally perturbs a system to be investigated. Rydberg electrons can scatter from one, two, or many ground-state atoms depending on the density of neighboring atoms. The effect of those scatterers on the Rydberg electron wave function can be used to study the properties of the ground-state atoms, such as their distribution and correlation, including in degenerate Bose or Fermi gases. In particular, the special case of two scatterers can shed light on Efimov physics, a three-body system with peculiar properties introduced in nuclear physics. To carry out this research, accurate wave functions are essential ingredients that current methods struggle to provide. Here, a non-perturbative approach based on Green's functions to compute wave functions and potential energy surfaces for Rydberg trilobite-like dimers, trimers, etc., will be developed. These accurate wave functions will then be employed in the calculation of photo-association (PA) spectra whose detailed lineshapes will unlock the information about the ground-state atoms, including their correlation (from two, three, four, or N-body). Finally, together with the computation of the Efimov wave functions, the probing of those elusive states with spectroscopic accuracy will be made possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will aid in the development of quantum technologies by adding to the theoretical approaches that can be used to plan optimum control of quantum systems. In particular, this project will investigate how to avoid errors in quantum computation that arise because of prior correlations between quantum systems and their environment.  This is important because understanding how quantum systems behave in various environments will lead to new knowledge in several fields ranging from biological systems, to materials science, fundamental physics, and molecular scale machines.  This work could thus enable better health care, better materials for use in industry as well as everyday life, and a variety of technologies that operate on the molecular scale.  This project will train students to use quantum physics techniques and to understand the physical concepts.  Outreach activities intended to reach a broader audience will also be undertaken as part of this project.<br/> <br/>In order to achieve reliable quantum information processing we must develop methods for controlling quantum systems.  This includes modeling quantum systems that are noisy due to interactions with their environment.  A standard method for describing the evolution of open quantum systems is to assume the environment and the system in question are initially decoupled, evolve under some joint evolution, and then average over the environmental degrees of freedom to obtain an effective noisy evolution.  This method of modeling the evolution is inadequate under some conditions such as strong coupling and quantum systems that are initially coupled to their environment.  The objective of this work is to aid in the development of quantum technologies by helping understand and describe requirements for practical modeling and error prevention strategies in these circumstances by understanding the limitations of previous work and finding ways to describe systems that do not satisfy the standard assumptions.

These are hydrogen-like states in which one electron is excited quite close to the ionization threshold. These states are very fragile, and easily perturbed by surrounding electric and magnetic fields; such Rydberg atoms interact strongly with other particles due to their large spatial volume. These states contrast with the low-angular momentum (low-L) states that are easily accessible in the lab by laser excitation from the ground state, and which have been studied extensively.  The less studied high-angular momentum (high-L) Rydberg states have unique advantages and pose certain challenges to both experimental and theoretical approaches. They are important due to the role they play in key processes in a wide range of environments. For example, Rydberg states played a critical role in cosmology during the recombination era, shortly (approximately 200 thousand years) after the Big Bang. Rydberg atoms are also now being studied for potential use as building blocks in quantum computation, somewhat similar to the role that semiconductors play in classical computers. Indeed, both Rydberg atoms and semiconductors owe their value to their exceptional versatility, sensitivity to environment and ease of control. This project will involve undergraduate students from underrepresented communities, providing valuable experiences in theoretical atomic physics research through year-long active mentoring, and summer research programs.<br/><br/>This research makes progress in the following three specific science projects: (1) Calculate the rates for angular momentum mixing of Rydberg states in dilute plasmas, (2) Optimize and design pulse shapes that facilitate intrashell coherent population transfer among degenerate highly excited Rydberg states, and (3) Calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for electron spin changing collisions of Rydberg atoms. The common theme for the three aims is to expose the rich, undervalued physics qualities of high-L Rydberg states that emerge from the underlying SO(4) symmetry group of the degenerate hydrogenic shell states. The Hilbert space of problems involving Rydberg states is extremely large, so direct exact quantum mechanical solutions are often numerically difficult due to extreme fluctuations in the wave functions. This program proposes to use a dual quantum-classical strategy, in which results obtained from feasible quantum mechanical calculations for low enough n values are compared and extrapolated by using classical mechanics calculations, by virtue of the correspondence principle and the underlying symmetry. Since it acts at a rather fundamental level, this research program is favorable to engaging junior and senior undergraduate students in relevant research at the forefront of atomic and molecular physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How can one characterize chaos in quantum systems with many particles? Does information get lost in a black hole? How can we develop a quantum gravity theory that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics? These seemingly distinct fundamental questions are all deeply related to the concept of quantum entanglement.  In classical mechanics in systems with many particles (many-body systems), because of chaos, it is difficult to predict anything about the future of a complicated system.  At the same time, however, the complexity induced by chaos can generate a kind of simplicity that allows us to ignore most details about the individual motion of the particles and describe a many-body system efficiently by macroscopic theories such as hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. This project will investigate how to describe chaos in quantum many-body systems, as opposed to classical many-body systems, and how to relate it to thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. Since the famous work of Bekenstein and Hawking, it has been gradually realized that thermodynamics is also deeply related to another deep mystery of nature, namely gravity. Einstein's general relativity theory describes gravity as a theory of curved and dynamical space-time geometry.  This project will investigate how the space-time geometry may emerge as a description of quantum entanglement in many-body systems. The project will provide graduate students with a unique research experience in the interdisciplinary area of quantum information science, high-energy physics and condensed matter physics. The PI will make sustained efforts to introduce the proposed research to undergraduate students and to disseminate the research results of this project beyond the physics community, by lectures, classes and articles.<br/><br/>This project studies quantum chaos and quantum gravity using quantum entanglement. The PI plans to characterize quantum chaos by the nonlocal propagation of quantum information, and generalize the criteria in classical chaos such as Lyapunov exponents to quantum systems. Using entanglement criteria of many-body quantum chaos, the relation of chaos with thermalization of an isolated system will be investigated. Physically, chaos in many-body systems is associated with nonlocal propagation of quantum information, which plays an essential role in thermalization process of an isolated system. In addition to providing a more solid foundation to understand quantum thermalization, the PI plans to further develop a general framework of non-equilibrium dynamics based on the new understanding of quantum chaos. Furthermore, chaos will also be studied using special models that are solvable under certain limit but still preserve chaos. Related to quantum gravity, the PI plans to study holographic duality and quantum gravity using random tensor networks, a framework suitable for describing highly entangled quantum states. With the new language of random tensor networks, it is possible to quantify how entanglement properties are encoded in emergent geometry. Different aspects of the holographic duality will be investigated, including global symmetries, geometrical fluctuation and how Einstein's equations can possibly emerge from entanglement. The PI also plans to apply the new understanding obtained to the long-standing black hole information paradox."

Thus far, the best candidate theory for accomplishing this fusion is string theory.   Professor Sahakian's research explores several key areas in string theory and quantum gravity.  It investigates the idea that our awareness of space may be only an ""emergent"" perception which arises from the unique ways in which quantum mechanics spreads (or ""entangles"") information across different objects.  This new rethinking of the nature of spacetime has recently shown great promise and may be key to addressing the longstanding problems in this field.  This project also explores some of the unique properties of black holes.  Black holes are extreme objects that test the limits of validity of our physical laws and hence are the ideal playgrounds for understanding quantum gravity.  This project therefore advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  An extensive undergraduate research program is also a key part of the proposed project, including a course-development component for an undergraduate course on modern topics in theoretical physics.   Such a course will help to provide undergraduate physics students with solid foundations for graduate school.   The PI will also continue preparing an undergraduate textbook on classical field theory, a subject which forms one of the cornerstones of physics.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Sahakian will study the emergence of spacetime from quantum entanglement.  This will be done primarily within the context of Matrix theory, a non-perturbative formulation of M-theory and hence of quantum gravity.  Professor Sahakian will test these ideas of emergent spacetime within the setting of black-hole physics, attempting to unravel the nature of the black-hole horizon where recent work suggests the possible breakdown of spacetime geometry, even at long distances.  It is also hoped that this research will lead to a better understanding of black-hole evaporation and the details of entanglement evolution in the process of transferring information from the interior of a black hole to the outside."

The laser-induced ionization and excitation of individual atoms and molecules beget in turn various nonlinear optical phenomena in the plasma medium. One such phenomenon, laser filamentation, is enabled by self-focusing of the laser beam, which results in a drastic contraction of the laser pulse and generation of an extended filament at a controllable stand-off distance. Partially ionized plasma is left in the wake of the filamenting laser pulse; it can be probed by subsequent laser pulses and is open to various practical applications. This theoretical research addresses a new realm of transient nonlinear optics in evolving filament-wake channels; it explores longer-lasting optical consequences of strong-field ionization occurring in a relatively dense plasma. The research will advance broader understanding of means to control strong-field light-matter interaction on a microscopic scale. It also directly addresses recent developments of filament-based, multiplex methods of remote detection of complex mixtures, which is a challenge with many technological applications. It is related to control of filamentation dynamics with the aim of remote lasing in the atmosphere, and to developing new sources of attosecond and X-ray pulses.<br/><br/>This research concerns the interrelated dynamics of ions, energetic free electrons, and excited neutrals in wake channels of femtosecond laser filaments, as well as the interaction of the evolving system with probe laser pulses. The expected outcomes will form a basis for effective control of filament-wake nonlinear optical effects. The task will be addressed using a combination of ab initio calculations for nonlinear response of individual ions, kinetic modeling of inhomogeneous ionized-gas medium evolution, and density matrix calculations for probe laser coupling with the medium. The objectives include:<br/>1) developing predictive models of the evolution of ion density profiles and molecular/atomic excitation in filament wake channels and ionization gratings, which is driven by competing processes of impact ionization, impact electronic excitation of neutrals and ions, dissociative recombination, vibrational excitation, and elastic scattering; <br/>2) calculating dynamic polarizability and hyperpolarizability coefficients of ions in the wake of the ionizing laser pulse (when perturbative approaches become applicable) by implementing the auxiliary-field approach and ab initio calculations, and applying the results to obtain evolving spatial profiles of dynamic quadratic and quartic nonlinear refractive indices in filament wake channels; and<br/>3) predicting outcomes of nonlinear interactions of probe laser pulses with the wake channels, including two-beam coupling mediated by ionization gratings, ionic rotational revivals, and controllable spatial-spectral patterns of dynamic Rabi sideband emission. <br/>The expected results will be applied to experiments on ionization-related polarization rotation, rotational-revival spectroscopy, and dynamic Rabi sidebands in filament wake channels at the Center for Advanced Photonics Research (CAPR) at Temple University.

The second is through continued participation in both the Space Explorers inner-city K-12 enrichment program and the Life-Long Learning (L3) program.  The final aspect involves improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration, and through the organization of relevant scientific meetings.<br/><br/>More technically, the goals of Professor Sethi's research center around two broad themes.  The ""structure"" aspect of this research involves exploring landscapes in field theory and string theory.  This will involve a number of topics, among them the description of flux backgrounds from a field-theory perspective and their realization in string theory via a novel landscape of anti-de Sitter space solutions;  the development of flux vacua in M-theory and type IIA string theory;  the role of anti-branes in flux vacua;  the exploration of constraints on inflating and de Sitter constructions in string theory;  the construction of accelerating space-times using stringy domain-wall solutions;  and the study of chiral gauge theory in two dimensions and its relation to new geometric structures.    By contrast, the ""symmetry"" aspect of the proposal involves exploring the implications of spontaneously broken symmetries in gravity and in effective field theory.  The questions in gravity revolve around the extent to which the dynamics of gravitational lumps is determined by symmetry.  In a broader context, anomalous and non-anomalous global symmetries can constrain effective field theory couplings with implications for condensed-matter systems such as quantum Hall systems.  The final set of questions involve supersymmetry in two ways:  first to develop a symbolic computation package that can generate supersymmetric Lagrangians with higher-derivative couplings (a long-needed tool that will have a host of applications in both string theory and field theory), and second to explore surprising simplifications in the vacuum structure of supersymmetric quantum-mechanics models."

These latter forces are very well understood in the framework of quantum field theory. In contrast, the gravitational force, because of its extreme weakness, is sizable only for macroscopic objects and is therefore mainly understood only at the classical level. Professor Chamseddine's research focuses on the development of a quantum theory of gravity. As such, research in this area promotes the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.    Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in high-energy physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.   Moreover, this project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East.

This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe.  <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless.   Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: The work proposed here is to develop a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the LAr1-ND Experiment.  This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations.  At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments.<br/> <br/>Broader Impact: This research program will serve as an invaluable proving ground for LAr TPC technology and in the reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments a success.  The construction effort at the three collaborating institutions Yale, Syracuse and Chicago will enable students and postdocs at each institution to participate and acquire invaluable hands-on experience with advanced detector technology that is a vital component of training scientists in the field of high-energy physics."

The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to study the properties and characteristics of this newly discovered particle as a laboratory to see if it behaves as the SM predicts or if there are deviations suggesting evidence for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. This group will participate in these studies.  The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples. It is possible that evidence for BSM physics could emerge at this higher energy and with the higher event statistics from the current run and by means of further upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS to follow.<br/><br/>To facilitate a detailed study of the Higgs Boson and search for other new states of matter, the NIU group will be focusing their studies on Higgs couplings, including self-coupling, in order to determine whether this particle is the sole Higgs boson postulated in the Standard Model, or one of multiple neutral scalar bosons postulated in various BSM scenarios. Much of the analytical effort is focused on searches for pair production of the only Higgs particle discovered so far.   Additionally the group has had a long-standing interest in the ATLAS searches for charged Higgs bosons featured in certain extended Higgs models, and in differential cross section measurements of Higgs boson decays into two gamma rays.  <br/><br/>The NIU group is also engaged in the Phase 2 Upgrade of the TileCAL, hadronic calorimeter, and experimental subsystem essential for energy and missing energy measurements, and in advanced Fast Track Triggering for the experiment called the FTK, which is central to being able to trigger on important physics objectives as the LHC luminosity increases.<br/><br/>An integral part of the NIU group activity is outreach to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.

Using analytical and numerical techniques, this project studies correlations between spatial positions and spins in such ultracold atomic few-body systems. These theoretical studies are conducted in close collaboration with experimentalists exploring ultracold matter. The project aims at developing a microscopic, bottom-up understanding of the correlations in different prototype quantum systems, where theoretical predictions can be confronted with experimental results. The long term goals of this branch of physics include the development of significantly improved imaging systems and sensors, which could have widespread applications. As part of this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in science and technology areas, in which there currently exists a high demand across the US. While conducting this research, the students will develop subsidiary skills in high performance computing.  <br/><br/>The idea behind the first study, which is motivated by on-going experiments in Jochim's group in Heidelberg, is conceptually simple. Preparing an initial few-fermion state in an external trap and then inducing an expansion by weakening the trap potential, the group will study how correlations of the initial state get imprinted on the time-evolved wave packet. They will try to develop methods to distinguish between ""trivial"" correlations induced by the particle statistics and ""non-trivial"" correlations due to the short-range contact interactions. Likewise, they will try to identify correlations which are signatures of the initial state, and contrast them with those developed during the expansion. The second and third topics are interrelated. They consider ultracold few-atom systems in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which introduce a coupling between the spin and the linear momentum of an atom. The spin-momentum coupling leads to non-quadratic single-particle dispersions, which modify the large interparticle-distance-asymptotics of oscillatory scattering wave functions and exponentially decaying bound state wave functions. The second topic entails developing two-particle scattering frameworks for various spin-momentum coupling schemes that account for the correlations between the spin and momentum. The anticipated findings are expected to significantly modify the standard textbook framework of partial wave scattering. The third topic entails determining bound state spectra and wave functions of few-atom states in the presence of spin-momentum coupling. Particular emphasis will be put on the enhancement of the correlations in the near-threshold regime. Spin-momentum coupling is an essential component in a myriad of applications including the study of (fractional) topological insulators, interferometry and gravimetry, spintronic devices, and the creation of Majorana fermions and their use in quantum computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores a breakdown of reductionism known as ""universality"" that is sometimes displayed by ensembles of ultra-cold atoms. Ensembles of ultra-cold atoms provide especially important examples of universal phenomena because they can be controlled and probed with exquisite precision. They also provide valuable paradigms for universality in other fields of physics, including nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics, and condensed-matter physics. Examples of the universal properties observed in dilute, ultra-cold gases, independent of the species of atom employed, include the binding energies of weakly bound clusters, the reaction rates for collisions between atoms and clusters, and the stability or lifetime of trapped ensembles.

Proton therapy for cancer treatment and food irradiation to eliminate pathogens are among the most remarkable applications. These successes are paving the way for new applications for particle accelerators, such as materials science experiments and nuclear waste transmutation, which would require much more intense beams than are currently available. A difficulty is that at such high beam intensities, beam induced damages on the accelerator structures cannot be tolerated. Achieving a high beam quality throughout the acceleration process thus becomes a critical issue. The dynamics of beams in accelerators is described by equations which can only be accurately solved with long and expensive simulations run on supercomputers. Accelerator design studies therefore involve time consuming, computer intensive simulations, limiting the range of design options which can be investigated. This project addresses this limitation by developing a numerical method that will significantly reduce the run times of existing numerical codes while maintaining a high level of accuracy. By accelerating beam dynamics simulations in accelerators, the new solver will help improve design optimization for the next generation of high intensity accelerators.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop new methods to predict the dynamics of high intensity beams in cyclotrons. The beam dynamics is described by the Vlasov equation, a six-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation, and quantitative results can only be obtained through numerical simulation. Particle codes based on the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm have been successfully used for this purpose. Still, a limitation of these codes is that a large number of particles need to be followed to limit statistical error, which leads to long run times. To reduce run times, the PI and graduate students will develop a novel noise reduction technique for the standard PIC algorithm, based on the use of sparse grids. In order to maximize the leverage from this new technique, they will implement high performance algorithms in their sparse-PIC solver, and optimize the sparse grids using model reduction techniques tailored for cyclotron simulations. At every stage of the development of the solver, they will compare the performance of the new code with the state-of-the-art code OPAL. The code will be available to collaborators at major cyclotron facilities to answer unresolved questions regarding the stability of high intensity beams in cyclotrons and to design new machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important direction for the research is to use mathematical models to explore these entangled states. This may have important applications, for example in managing the security of communication channels and in quantum information science.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop a complete catalog of correlation relations among a large number N of fundamental physical systems (spins, atoms, photons). This will be done by the technical process of bi-separation of quantum states. We have used both analytic and computer-based mathematical procedures to carry out, but have not yet published, a preliminary exploration of pure state bi-separations. These lead to constraints on occupation of what can be called entanglement-shared quantum state space. These constraints have a geometrical interpretation via simplexes and polytopes in N dimensions. The consequent description of N-party additivity leads to entanglement sharing relations and they substantially extend in a new direction the concurrence-based results called quantum monogamy. In the important but still simple case of 3 entangled parties, there are three bi-separations: a|bc, b|ac, and c|ab, and the consequent polytope in this case is a pair of base-to-base tetrahedrons inside a unit cube. Cross sections of the polytope transverse to the body diagonal of the cube are triangles, and we have found that their areas serve to quantify the amount of entanglement sharing that is possible among the three parties a,b,c. Exchanges with the fields of quantum information and quantum optics appear desirable and feasible, for example in developing protocols for multi-mode entanglement swapping at the macroscopic level."

This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/><br/>The work proposed here is to develop the front-end electronics for a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the Liquid Argon, Near Detector (LAr1-ND) Experiment. This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations. At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. The electronics developed through this award will also advance an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, which is the likely technology in the future large-scale Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) being constructed at FNAL."

T cells are central effectors of the adaptive immune response. They recognize molecules on the surface of cells, and initiate signaling that results in the immune response. An essential step during this process is the reorientation of the T cell microtubule-organizing center (centrosome). Proper positioning of the centrosome is required for normal signaling through the T cell receptor and the directed release of lymphokine molecules in T helper cells or cytotoxins in cytotoxic T cells. While the signaling pathways between T cell activation and centrosome positioning have been well studied, the physical mechanisms underlying asymmetric centrosome positioning are not understood. The PI will combine quantitative imaging and biophysical measurements with molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the role of cytoskeletal forces in centrosome positioning. The PI will develop a course on Biophysics of the Cell covering topics ranging from cytoskeletal forces to mechano-chemistry of signaling. Research results from the proposed projects will be used to develop a novel laboratory component. The PI and co-PI will offer a beginning undergraduate course focused on introducing students to concepts of critical thinking and research practice using hands on research experience on relevant themes such as cellular force generation. The PI and co-PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate student research and encourage minority students and high school students from the area to participate in research. The PI will organize a week-long biophysics lab demonstration as part of the Summer Girls Program in the Physics Department to encourage participation of female high school students in science. The co-PI will develop user friendly educational software modules teaching how complex cytoskeletal dynamics emerges from simple molecular interactions.<br/><br/>These studies, using an integrated experimental and computational approach, will lead to fundamental understanding of centrosome positioning which is critical in many cellular functions in many cell types. The group will use state-of-the-art imaging techniques to quantitatively analyze the 3-dimensional shape and dynamics of microtubules. In parallel, they will develop a computational model of centrosome movement driven by MT dynamics and motor activity. Model parameters will be set by comparisons with experimental observations (Objective 1). The PI will investigate the interactions between the acto-myosin cytoskeleton and the MT-dynein systems and their respective roles in centrosome positioning. The PI will also extend the model to include both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and associated motors, their mutual couplings and systematically model perturbations carried out in parallel experiments (Objective 2). This research will unravel novel physical principles involved in the collective dynamics of two distinct but interacting force-generating biopolymer filament systems and associated motors. The development of the mechano-chemical model will be applicable to many other phenomena in cell biology and hence a valuable contribution to the field. More broadly, this work will provide novel insights on the principles of self-organization in highly complex active matter systems.<br/> <br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. Should this next period allow the Borexino detector to measure the CNO neutrino flux sufficiently well to infer the metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) of the sun's interior, it could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. <br/><br/>This award provides funding for the continuing role of Virginia Tech in the Borexino experiment, the world's purest large-volume liquid scintillator detector located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, designed to measure the principle components of the neutrino spectrum coming from the Sun as it converts hydrogen into helium through fusion. They have measured the 7-Be, 8-B, and pep neutrino fluxes from the Sun, and set a limit on the CNO neutrino flux. The next three-year period with ultra-low background requires re-calibration to verify these results, and to prepare the collaboration to move into a new 'CNO focused' phase. The principle physics goals are 1) measurement of the CNO neutrino flux, 2) more precise results for the 7-Be and pep neutrino flux, and 3) a better result for the pp neutrino flux. <br/><br/>The broader impact on science, technology and outreach that is expected from the program includes: the training of graduate and undergraduate students in current topical physics research; experience with deployment and utilization of ultra-clean calibration techniques; presentations of this research program to undergraduates, through research projects, student presentations, lectures, and problems - exposing the next generation of scientists from multiple fields to the excitement of astroparticle physics; and a broad engagement of the neutrino community through their Center for Neutrino Physics."

Notably, dolphins are one of a handful of species that are vocal learners; thus the dolphin presents us with a unique and alternative model to songbirds to advance our understanding of the processes that underlie vocal learning and communication in a large-brained mammal showing high social and behavioral complexity. Despite decades of research on dolphin vocal communication, the constituent elements, the sequential and temporal organization of the elements, and the nature of vocal transactions between dolphins remain enigmatic. In order to decipher dolphin communication and further elucidate these issues, the PIs will use observational approaches in the wild and in an aquarium as well as two experimental approaches in an aquarium. A first approach studies how dolphins coordinate their behavior in the face of novelty: How do dolphins synchronize their behavior when requested to present novel behaviors in tandem? How do they succeed in working as a team when confronted with a new challenge? In a second approach, the researchers will provide dolphins with a two-way, interactive touchscreen and audio system. Their proclivity for vocal learning and their other cognitive processes will be probed by giving them choice and control over the interactive system and observing and documenting how they use and respond to the contingencies of their interactions, which shall be obtaining novel acoustic signals temporally paired with objects, interactions or activities. The aquarium studies are particularly conducive to outreach efforts and informal science education since the dolphin-related activities will be conducted in an open amphitheater environment at a leading aquarium. The exhibit has changed from dolphin shows to more educational demonstrations about animal care, behavior, and conservation. The research activities will take place concurrently with visits of the public and field trips of school children and therefore, the research endeavor will be communicated to the public in real time. Virtually all the activities proposed can, with modest effort and cost, be made into an open exhibit at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, instructing visiting schoolchildren on the research process and on collaborative research across scientific boundaries. The field trips to the research sites are organized jointly with undergraduate and graduate courses in field research for Hunter College students and are excellent opportunities to showcase and engage actual cutting edge research to these students. This tightly-knit interdisciplinary collaboration between the labs of animal cognitive psychologist and marine mammal scientist and physicist, computational neuroscientist and bio-acoustician, seeks to and extend high-throughput settings to dolphin communication studies in captivity.<br/><br/>A key intellectual merit of this proposal is to address these fundamental questions in the field of animal cognition and communication through powerful methods drawn from statistical mechanics, machine learning, and signal processing.

Another technical problem is the design and deployment of an advanced two-way interactive system consisting of an underwater touchpad and real-time audio input/output, plus the associated set of interaction interfaces.

Gravitational forces change the position and speed of a mass. The most precise measurement  devices for gravitational forces are laser interferometers sensing the motion of mirrors acting as test masses, in particular those built for the detection of gravitational waves. Theoretical research in quantum metrology has predicted the possibility to improve force measurements  by realizing a quantum non-demolition (QND) scheme for position and speed. Such a scheme surpasses the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL), which is a direct consequence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation and a fundamental, yet not ultimate, limit in gravitational-wave detectors. Up to now, neither a position nor a speed measurement noise spectral density beyond the SQL has been demonstrated. This project studies and demonstrate strategies toward improving the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors upon this limit. It has an experimental component at the University of Hamburg, led by Schnabel, and a theoretical component at Caltech, led by Chen. This project will serve as a training ground for young scientists, in particular teaching Ph.D. students how to conduct research within a close collaboration between experimental and theoretical research groups. Research carried out here will benefit the broader community of quantum optomechanics, adding new tools for preparing, manipulating and observing the quantum states of mechanical objects. Techniques developed in this project will also be applicable to other precision measurement systems.<br/><br/>The aims of this project are the theoretical analysis and the construction of a new type of a cavity-enhanced optomechanical interferometer; the characterization of the interferometric measurement of speed as a QND variable; and the employment of the new setup's unique properties for demonstrating a noise spectral density beyond the SQL. The new setup will be table-top  and will comprise for the first time a membrane inside a ring cavity. In contrast to previously investigated coupled cavities with a membrane in the middle, the new setup avoids optomechanical instabilities and will allow for much higher intra-cavity light powers. Furthermore, the new setup has two output ports, whose combination enables the simultaneous monitoring of membrane position and membrane speed. This unique feature will be used for a direct comparison between position measurements that are affected by quantum back-action and QND speed measurements. The high intra-cavity light powers, together with the back-action evading property of the  new system and the injection of squeezed states of light will enable reaching and even surpassing the SQL at temperatures above 5K. The first demonstration and verification of QND techniques as planned in this project will be accompanied by a detailed analysis of scalability with regard to detection frequency and test mass size. This would be development towards a new interferometer topology with unprecedented sensitivity for the detection of gravitational waves."

Understanding how physical theories fit together in challenging regimes has in the past led to insights of spectacular consequences. An example of this could be Maxwell's understanding of how electricity and magnetism fit together, a synthesis that led to the discovery of radio waves, with the ensuing transformational changes they induced in our society. A second very important objective of this type of work is the formation of human resources of very high quality. Physicists trained in these disciplines have moved on to make contributions leading to rewarding careers in industry and in finance, as well as science.<br/><br/>The group will study the application of techniques of loop quantum gravity in spherically symmetric contexts with the ultimate goal of understanding black hole evaporation. They will study the back-reaction of quantum fields living on spherically symmetric quantum space-times that they developed in a previous project. The discreteness of the quantum space-time naturally regularizes the infinities of quantum field theory yielding all results finite. To study the back reaction will require quantum space-times more realistic than the ones we have up to now, including dynamical evolution. They propose to find the quantum space-time of a collapsing shell and compute the back reaction of fields living on it. In addition to this they propose studying the structure of the quantum space-times we have up to now, in particular their singularity structure in the case of extremal and super extremal charged black holes and the Cauchy horizons that appear in the solutions. They also propose to continue the study of uniform discretizations as a quantization approach, in particular comparing with the exact quantization that was used to construct the spherical quantum space-times, which relied on the Abelianization of the algebra of constraints, a condition that one does not expect to generalize for more complex models. They will also explore a proposal for the problem of time and an ensuing proposal for solving the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. They wish to explore more general models than the ones worked out up to now and to study the issue of strong emergence."

Although there are a billion neutrinos for every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-called ""weak"" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of the fundamental particles.  One of the big mysteries in neutrino science is how they change (or ""oscillate"") from one type to another. The study of neutrinos has progressed rapidly over the past 25 years. The ultimate goal of neutrino oscillation experiments such as this is to determine whether neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently. This can tell us about the evolution of the universe a fraction of a second after the big bang, and provide clues about why the universe is currently filled with matter and not anti-matter.<br/><br/>Neutrino oscillation experiments produce neutrinos in one particular type (referred to as flavor), which is measured at a near detector close to the neutrino production point, and search for the disappearance of this flavor and/or the appearance of a new neutrino flavor at a far detector.

Without appendages or membranes to use as lift-generating surfaces, flying snakes flatten from head to tail and glide using the body as a single ""wing"". In the air, the snakes simultaneously send traveling waves down the body while oscillating in the vertical plane, a flight behavior unlike any other found in the natural or engineering world. This project aims to understand the mechanisms that explain the unique flight abilities of flying snakes. Gliding in live snakes will be recorded to determine their detailed body movements and sectional shapes, including experiments to understand how snakes remain stable and maneuver in the air. Physical and computational models will be used to understand how the snake's shape and continuously changing body posture contribute to the production of aerodynamic forces for weight support and stability. Additional theoretical and physical models will be developed to investigate the requirements for producing snake-like locomotion in the air. <br/><br/>The subject of this study is an exciting topic for students and the broader public, and the proposed research will additionally serve as a springboard for new initiatives that integrate physics, biology, and engineering into novel educational programming. Animal groups that fly have been tremendously successful in the biological world, and yet no clear picture has emerged to explain how powered flight has evolved from terrestrial species. In particular, we lack an understanding of how species have transitioned from static gliding to active flapping flight. The undulating movements of the gliding snake, which can be considered as a continuously morphing wing, present characteristics that bridge from passive gliding to powered flight. The flying snake is an active glider, representing the only functional intermediate across the spectrum of gliding to flapping flight. Understanding the mechanics of gliding flight in snakes will therefore lend insight into how one group of species has successfully overcome the biomechanical challenges resulting from shifting forces and rotational torques on the body, a similar problem associated with active flapping flight. Additionally, the aerodynamics of flight at low Reynolds number has received far less attention than the flight dynamics of larger engineered flyers, and this project will elucidate how a craft with symmetrical airfoil shape, but asymmetrical and dynamic body posture, can be physically advantageous. Specifically, the unexpected aerodynamic performance of the snake may originate in its ability to ""surf"" on its own wake. The determination of muscle activity patterns during perturbation and turning trials will provide the first evidence of the neuromuscular control system required for this type of undulating flyer. In combination, the proposed research to understand how snakes glide will provide contributions across disciplines and will potentially lead to the development of novel micro-air vehicles. <br/><br/>Gliding flight in snakes is perhaps one of the most spectacular behaviors in the natural world, and has the potential to inspire new generations of students to take interest in STEM fields. This project taps into the natural appeal of this animal to develop new educational content for teachers and the public. Two major synergistic initiatives will be launched based on flying snake research. The first creates exciting, web-based multi-media material that can be easily adapted and used by teachers across educational levels. The new material will include informative video developed in collaboration with a professional television producer with years of experience creating programs for the National Geographic Channel. The second effort will use research in this project to create a new museum exhibit on flying snakes at the Science Museum of Western Virginia, with assistance from a public school teacher to help translate research into pedagogy. This exhibit will be offered for adaptation at museums worldwide, including the integration into a new exhibit on biomechanics at the Field Museum in Chicago. In addition to the global reach of these efforts, the appeal of flying snakes will be used as a mechanism to recruit underrepresented students into research at the undergraduate and graduate levels through targeted recruiting and visits to local universities with traditionally underserved student populations."

Virtually all the activities proposed can, with modest effort and cost, be made into an open exhibit at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, instructing visiting schoolchildren on the research process and on collaborative research across scientific boundaries. The field trips to the research sites are organized jointly with undergraduate and graduate courses in field research for Hunter College students and are excellent opportunities to showcase and engage actual cutting edge research to these students. This tightly-knit interdisciplinary collaboration between the labs of animal cognitive psychologist and marine mammal scientist and physicist, computational neuroscientist and bio-acoustician, seeks to and extend high-throughput settings to dolphin communication studies in captivity.<br/><br/>A key intellectual merit of this proposal is to address these fundamental questions in the field of animal cognition and communication through powerful methods drawn from statistical mechanics, machine learning, and signal processing. Central technical problems in ""decoding"" dolphin communication are the difficulty in sound localization and attributing the detected vocalizations to specific individual dolphins, the lack of automated behavioral analysis methods, and the crucial step of creating an integrated picture of attributed vocal and behavioral transactions or ""conversations"" that can be subjected to high-through analysis. Another technical problem is the design and deployment of an advanced two-way interactive system consisting of an underwater touchpad and real-time audio input/output, plus the associated set of interaction interfaces. Finally, this project also addresses important technical problems in the deployment of aerial and aquatic drones for field studies."

Forces could depend on several properties of the test objects involved, such as mass (like gravity), or charge (like electromagnetism).  The proposed experiments concentrate on forces that depend on spin, which can be thought of as the rotation of an object around its axis. Most subatomic particles (including the protons, neutrons, and electrons of ordinary matter) have non-zero spin, which determines their magnetic properties: magnetic forces depend on spin.  The discovery of an additional macroscopic force that depends on spin would have enormous implications for physics from subatomic to cosmological scales.  A variety of extensions to the Standard Model (the most successful theory of particle physics to date, but widely believed to be incomplete) predict short-range spin-dependent forces.  These forces are mediated by particles that could contribute to ""dark matter,"" the otherwise unknown quantity hypothesized to make up about one quarter of the mass of the universe and to explain the apparent mass distributions of galaxies. During its execution, this fundamental project will also provide all participants (including undergraduates who have contributed to this proposal) with experience in mechanical design, vacuum technology, low-noise electronics, semiconductor and magnetic materials processing, and other practical techniques useful in a wide range of science and engineering fields.  The experiment will also be a key focus of the Indiana University Center for Spacetime Symmetries (IUCSS), which was founded by the PI and his colleagues to strengthen and publicize IU's growing expertise in the investigation of the structure of spacetime.<br/><br/>The experiment uses 1-kilohertz planar oscillators as test masses with a thin shield between them to suppress backgrounds, a technique that has demonstrated the capability to probe micron-scale distances using relatively large (square-centimeter) masses, and to operate at the limit of instrumental thermal noise at room temperature.  The principal challenge will be to overcome the anticipated magnetic backgrounds associated with the use of polarized test masses.  To this end we have developed spin-polarized test masses with very low intrinsic magnetism. We will use them in our experiments to conduct initial searches for several velocity-independent spin-coupled forces with unprecedented sensitivity below one millimeter, and to search for several more velocity-dependent interactions that are presently unconstrained by experiment. We will also investigate polarized materials that have the potential to improve our experimental sensitivity by several additional orders of magnitude. At the completion of the award period, it is our expectation that, in the absence of a discovery, we will have set limits on as many as eleven previously unconstrained spin-coupled interactions of electrons in the sub-millimeter range, and up to four more limits with sensitivity at least order of magnitude greater than present constraints."

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored.  Currently the most successful theory for explaining how these elementary particles interact at the highest possible energies is string theory.   String theory has the advantage of not only explaining the existence of all of the elementary particles as different excitations of a fundamental string, but also explaining how gravity might be unified with the other, non-gravitational forces. In his research, Professor Anchordoqui aims to develop methods to search for and test some of the ideas coming from string theory at the LHC.    As a consequence, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.

Assuming that the fundamental string mass scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, Professor Anchordoqui will develop a number of search strategies that would signal string physics at the LHC. These include a re-examination of the so-called ""Green-Schwarz mechanism"", a modification of an action functional of a quantum field theory involving higher gauge fields that makes a quantum anomaly of the original action functional disappear, as well as the study of the minimal left-right symmetric intersecting D-brane model.  He also plans to investigate whether the (possible) discrepancy between observation and theoretical calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be explained in the context of low-mass-scale string resonances.    Professor Anchordoqui will also undertake a phenomenological analysis of inflationary potentials exhibiting S-duality.

The former governs the large-scale structure of the universe and is manifestly classical.  The latter describes the fundamental interactions --- electromagnetic, weak, and strong --- that operate at a subatomic level.  But, could it be possible that these two seemingly different theories were actually two different sides of the same coin?  Could they be regarded as dual manifestations of an overarching set of physical principles?  If this were the case, general relativity and quantum field theory would complement rather than conflict each other, as they would be equivalent, albeit with different applicability regimes.  In his research, Professor Varela will develop aspects of this idea, which is commonly known as the so-called ""AdS/CFT correspondence"".   This research advances the national interest by promoting the development of science in a fundamental direction, by developing relations among the laws of physics at deeper and deeper levels.  It will also have broader impacts by providing training for junior physicists and by disseminating its results to the general public, especially to members of under-represented groups.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Varela will study different aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence with a focus in the supergravity regime where tighter control of the correspondence is attained.  New tools will be introduced and developed to construct solutions to the supergravity equations that contain anti-de Sitter space.  These methods will exploit the reformulations of higher-dimensional supergravities that make exceptional symmetries manifest, and will also utilize restricted tensor and duality hierarchies.  Effective lower-dimensional supergravity theories with AdS vacua will be constructed and their embeddings into string theory elucidated.

However, it is challenged by two dramatic breakdowns of dimensional analysis---the incredible smallness of the vacuum energy and of the Higgs mass, compared to the characteristic scale of gravity. With the hope of helping to resolve these puzzles, Professor Dubovskiy aims to enrich the effective field theory toolbox with new sophisticated techniques and to come up with and test new radical theoretical ideas beyond the traditional framework. At the same time he will be looking for new observational probes, which may provide new hints on the origin of the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy. The research of Professor Dubovskiy will cover a broad spectrum of physical phenomena, ranging from the superradiant instability of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover new particles to the dynamics of flux tubes, responsible for the confinement of quarks. <br/><br/>The research that will be funded covers not only a wide range of topics in high energy theory and cosmology, but has an impact throughout the Physics Division.   For example, studies of the vacuum structure of string theory has led Prof. Dubovskiy to propose a new type of particle related to the axion, which would constitute the dark matter.   Studying the interactions of this dark matter with black holes has led to extraordinary experimental signatures, ranging from astrophysical studies of black hole masses to specific gravitational wave signatures that are in the range accessible to the Advanced Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).   These will be studied in detail.   There are also substantial interrelations with atomic physics and with nuclear physics.    One of the other projects will contribute to understanding the dynamics of flux tubes, which hold quarks together in the nucleon.<br/><br/>The award will also fund community outreach activities.  Professor Dubovskiy will contribute to the development of the NYU Science Communication Workshop program, which helps train a generation of scientists in effective communication with the public, and the award will support numerous scientists.    He also will give presentations on particle physics and cosmology at a local high school.  In addition, the research project relies on the active involvement of graduate students and postdocs, thereby bringing junior physicists to the frontiers of fundamental physics research."

These are grand science questions and a significant part of the world's physics and astronomy endeavor is directed toward answering them. For example, recent experiments have revealed some of the properties of the ghost-like neutrinos, and planned experiments seek to uncover more. An objective of this Project will be to better understand the implications of these properties for the grand questions described above. This will require honing humanity's fundamental theory of nature, i.e., Quantum Mechanics, into a tool capable of modeling the behavior of neutrinos in the extreme environments provided by the cosmos. Another key product of this Project will be the training of young nuclear physicists, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. <br/><br/>The research supported in this Project will be directed toward probing the fundamental physics of neutrinos and nuclei by exploiting the intersection of exciting new developments in nuclear physics and neutrino physics on the one hand, with rapidly advancing probes of astrophysical environments on the other. A key issue in this enterprise will be studying how neutrinos interact in dense matter and how these interactions may cause neutrinos to change their flavors (e.g., electron type neutrinos changing to tau type and vice versa) and/or their spins (e.g., left-handed to right-handed, and vice versa - if neutrinos are Majorana in character this is tantamount to changing neutrinos to antineutrinos). This is a fiercely nonlinear problem because neutrino flavor/spin determines how neutrinos interact, and how they interact determines how flavors/spin change. To these ends, the P.I. and his graduate and undergraduate students will work toward: (1) Understanding and modeling the quantum kinetic equations which govern neutrino flavor and spin evolution in a general medium; (2) Constructing large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor/spin evolution in various supernova, stellar collapse, and compact object merger environments and assessing the feedback of this neutrino flavor physics on the prospects for the synthesis of nuclei in these sites; (3) Understanding nuclear structure, neutrino-nucleus interactions, nuclear partition functions, and weak strength distributions in high temperature environments."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>There have been hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos, and clarifying these ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of this project. The work itself will be the further development of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology for use in neutrino physics as part of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment and the MicroBooNE experiment. These neutrino experiments are all located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The MicroBooNE experiment should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether predicted ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. In addition to the contribution to the fundamental neutrino physics mentioned above, this research will serve as an invaluable proving ground for the calibration, reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments, such as the planned DUNE experiment, a success.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the project involves bringing current techniques in high energy physics to the broader local community. The south side neighborhoods surrounding the UChicago campus are largely populated with underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and this project aims to build a program within the Department of Physics that connects university students with local elementary and middle school children to introduce them to concepts in physics with the aid of fun, interactive demonstrations."

Gravitational wave detectors are interferometers in which an intense laser beam bounces between two sets of mirrors in orthogonal arms.  Gravitational waves cause differences in the path length of the laser beam between the two interferometer arms, giving rise to a distinct interference pattern that when analyzed identifies the event that created them. The detection sensitivity of GWD is determined by various noise sources, among which, thermal noise of the coatings in the mirrors of the interferometer is a main component. Thermal noise in the high reflectance amorphous oxide coatings in the interferometer's mirrors causes path length differences that can mask the signals from gravitational waves. To increase the sensitivity of present GWD and meet the demands of future GWD, a concerted effort to understand and control the mechanisms that give rise to thermal noise in amorphous oxide coatings is imperative. This work will form part of that effort. <br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at demonstrating  amorphous oxide coatings with significantly reduced thermal noise and superior optical properties that will enable an approximate 10x increase in sensitivity of state-of-the-art GWD. The research effort has two specific aims: 1) to  realize  amorphous metal oxide thin films by ion beam sputtering with reduced thermal noise through a systematic parametric study of the deposition conditions used to grow single films; and 2) to engineer  multilayer dielectric coatings using these materials with reduced mechanical loss compared to state-of-the-art. A synergistic characterization effort will support the materials' growth. In particular the CSU researchers will collaborate with Caltech researchers to assess mechanical loss in single and multilayer dielectric coatings. This research will support the LIGO program in different ways. Through fundamental studies in amorphous oxides it will enable investigations of the physical mechanisms that  come into play in affecting thermal noise. It will also offer the opportunity to seek for new coating designs that will increase sensitivity of advanced LIGO and of the next generation GWD.

In addition, this research is relevant for important practical applications with important societal implications, such as the development of better clocks for GPS systems. To date success in this area has been primarily restricted to studies of the simpler atomic systems; comparable levels of understanding have not been achieved for more complex atoms in the Periodic Table.  This project focuses on developing a high-precision theoretical and computational approach that seeks to bring the theoretical understanding of complicated atoms of transition metals to the same level of sophistication afforded presently only to much simpler atomic systems.  If successful, the results could open up much of the Periodic Table to applications that heretofore could only be pursued with the simplest atoms. As such, this project provides ample opportunities for the training of students and post-doctoral fellows on topics at the leading edge of scientific research in physics. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a next-generation fully relativistic broadly applicable atomic code, based on the combination of large-scale configuration interaction and all-order linearized coupled-cluster method capable of predicting properties of open-shell atoms with precision of a few percent. The main feature of the code is to be able to treat systems where no accurate description of atomic properties is presently possible. While tremendous progress has been made recently in high-precision atomic calculations, treatment of correlation in d- and f-shell open systems present frontier challenges to AMO theory. This project will address the following short comings of current approaches needed for the treatment of correlations in d- and f-shell atomic open systems: omission of three-body interactions, limited choice of the starting potential, and the need for efficient selection of most important configurations for the construction of very large configuration spaces. The resulting code will be able to calculate a wide range of atomic properties including energies, g-factors, hyperfine constants, various transition matrix elements, electric-dipole and electric-quadrupole static and dynamic polarizabilities, long-range interaction potential parameters, various P(parity)-odd and T(time)-odd effects, sensitivity factors for tests of variation of the fine-structure constant and atomic tests of local Lorentz invariance. The performance of the new-generation code will be tested for systems with several valence electrons."

Undergraduates will also be sent to perform research at the University of Washington through a collaboration formed with a gravity research group there. This collaboration gives the students experience working in a world-class research environment. Alumni of the laboratory have secured prestigious graduate fellowships and industrial positions.

This award also allows undergraduates to participate in valuable dissemination efforts  through presentations at national and regional conferences, as well as publication of research results. Finally, tests of gravity are of great interest to research in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to particle physics and precision measurement science.<br/><br/>     This award supports high-precision experiments that will test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) of General Relativity and the gravitational Inverse-Square Law (ISL) at unprecedented levels. The WEP will be tested at the millimeter scale and the ISL will be probed over sub-millimeter distances with unmatched sensitivity down to approximately 25 microns. Both tests use a novel parallel-plate torsion pendulum and attractor mass design. In recent years the study of the gravitational interaction at short (sub-millimeter) distance scales has gained much attention due in a large part to unification scenarios arising in string or M theory that require more than three spatial dimensions, some of which could be macroscopic. Short-range tests of gravity and the WEP also investigate possible proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, generally attributed to Dark Energy. Finally, such tests present the possibility to search for hypothetical new interactions due to exotic particles or other phenomena. Many scenarios concerning these effects predict a violation of the WEP or ISL at short distances. Since 1999, experimental limits have improved dramatically so that the ISL has proven valid over distances down to approximately 55 microns. A dedicated test of the WEP, however, has not been performed below the millimeter scale. The work described in this proposal will probe the WEP for test mass separations at the sub-millimeter scale. This measurement will be accomplished with a parallel-plate torsion pendulum design that will provide an essentially null experiment and use multiple composition dipole combinations. Similarly, an unparalleled test of the gravitational ISL will be pursued by decreasing the pendulum/attractor test mass separation to 100 microns."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe.  A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another, i.e. oscillate. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  This particular project will focus on the study of the oscillations of the neutrinos between different types. The award will support the work of one post-doctoral researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on the neutrino experiments: MINERvA and MicroBooNE, both measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. These oscillations are of great interest to the scientific community since they could show indications of BSM physics.  To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions with nuclei is required. This award will be used to measure these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL, which will be beneficial for both neutrino and nuclear physics. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away)."

The residual strong interactions between protons and neutrons give rise to all of nuclear physics, from the simplest nuclear reactions responsible for fusion, to the intricate structure of large unstable nuclei. In essence, nuclei are to the strong 'chromodynamic' force what molecules are to the electromagnetic force. Tremendous progress is being made by solving the theory of strong interactions numerically. Current computing power and algorithms have put one within reach of realistic computations. Quantitative knowledge of the strong force will ultimately render nucleons and nuclei into laboratories for investigating fundamental symmetries and probing the limits of the Standard Model of particle physics. The comprehensive research program of the PI will combine advances in theoretical physics and high-performance computing to help advance our knowledge about nucleons and nuclei to the most advanced level yet. Moreover, the scope of this program affords both student and post-doctoral researchers considerable opportunities for training in nuclear and computational science, two areas in which an advanced technical workforce is much needed.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to study electromagnetic and parity-violating properties of strongly bound systems directly from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The distribution of charge and magnetism within nucleons will be explored by calculating their magnetic moments and electromagnetic polarizabilities using lattice gauge theory. Effort will also be geared toward studying the electromagnetic structure of light nuclei and hyper-nuclei using lattice QCD techniques, including the challenge of reducing the quark mass. Manifestations of the weak interaction at low energies will additionally be investigated from QCD. The parity-violating component of non-leptonic weak interactions introduces hadronic parity violation, and probes quark-quark correlations deep within hadrons. Due to feasibility of lattice QCD computations in the isotensor channel, lattice renormalization of isotensor parity violation will be determined and electromagnetic mixing will be addressed for the first time. Novel methods will be sought for future lattice calculations in the remaining isospin channels."

As a familiar example, consider how a hot cup of tea or a cold glass of water equilibrate to room temperature.  One cools down while the other warms up; but in each case individual molecular interactions affect the rate and the fluctuations with which these systems approach equilibrium.  A more nuanced example comes from the field of quantum computing, where information can be encoded in the quantum mechanical spin states of individual molecules.  One compelling motivation for this is to produce more powerful computers with memory and information processing capabilities far superior to today's classical computers.  However, since relaxation towards equilibrium can disorganize the quantum information stored in molecules, equilibration is normally considered an obstacle or a hindrance for quantum computing.  The goal of this project is to find ways to utilize the stability of states near equilibrium in order to improve quantum computing protocols.  Methods to characterize and influence the stability of multi-particle quantum states will be developed.  Techniques to ""attract"" or nudge any given initial state towards a set of stable equilibrium states that contain genuinely non-classical multi-particle correlations (""entanglement"") needed for quantum computing will be explored.  This research will address fundamental questions about the conditions under which stabilization to a desired quantum state may be achieved, and it will expand the toolkit and of methods to characterize and control dissipative quantum systems.  This project also provides education and training for students working on subjects at the cross-disciplinary boundaries between quantum information science, quantum control theory, applied mathematics, and many-body and statistical physics.  <br/><br/>Over the last few years, the principal investigator has established rigorous conditions for a general quantum state of interest to be the unique fixed point of a class of continuous-time ""frustration-free"" Markovian dynamics, subject to realistic locality constraints. Building on these results, this project aims to explore quantum stabilization problems in physical settings that remain largely uncharted as yet -- for instance: (i) Continuous-time Markovian dynamics under more general constraints than imposed by locality, including sensitivity to perturbations and periodically time-varying Floquet-Markov generators; (ii) Constrained discrete-time Markovian dynamics, for which the intriguing possibilities of exact dissipative state preparation and dissipative encoding in finite time arise; (iii) Randomized open-system dynamics, which may shed light on the stabilizability properties of generic (random) target states or subspaces. The methods to be employed will be both analytical and numerical, and will draw on a diverse range of tools from applied mathematics and quantum control theory (including operator algebras, Lyapunov stability techniques, and semi-definite programming), to quantum information theory and many-body physics (notably, entanglement theory, information-preserving structures, and tensor-network techniques). Theoretically, a central theme will be to clarify the extent to which core features from many-body and statistical mechanics -- in particular, the complexity of quantum correlations in the equilibrium state, the lack of frustration, the gapped nature or the commutativity of the underlying ""parent"" Hamiltonians -- may be brought to bear on the feasibility and efficiency of stabilization tasks for quantum information processing.  From a practical standpoint, the goal of these investigations is to improve protocols for dissipative quantum state preparation and quantum information encoding."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter (DM) is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. Our knowledge about DM existence has grown significantly over the past decade, mainly through observation of its gravitational influence. However, fundamental questions still remain unsolved: Is DM a particle? Is there more than one type of DM? Does it interact via non-gravitational force? We are systematically searching for DM and scrutinizing the claims of its detection, but to date, no one has reported a conclusive DM signal. This forces us to broaden our search, as well as to develop technologies capable of making measurements orders of magnitude more sensitive than what is currently available. Direct DM detection experiments aim to measure the energy deposited by DM as it scatters off the atoms in a detector. Among them, noble-liquid-based experiments are presently leading the field and are expected to improve the sensitivity of DM searches by two orders of magnitude by the end of this decade. To achieve this, the experiments rely heavily on increasing target mass and achieving a very low background environment. The current generation of noble-liquid DM detectors is limited by the radioactivity in the detector materials, the photomultipliers (PMTs), and the target itself. <br/><br/>This award will support the development of radio-pure hybrid photosensors with a simpler internal structure, much lower intrinsic sensor radioactivity, and significantly better charge resolution than a PMT. The UC Davis team will also design and construct a noble liquid test cell that will precisely tailor the effects of detector design parameters on the charge-to-light ratio background rejection. This effort will be combined with a related analysis in the liquid-argon-based DarkSide-50 DM search program. Employing the charge-to-light ratio rejection can extend the sensitivity of the DarkSide-50 detector in the energy region of importance for low mass DM searches.<br/><br/>The main focus of the broader impacts is hands-on experience for students, ranging from high school to graduate school, combined with providing mentorship on how to successfully develop a STEM career. The PI will coordinate these efforts with two summer school programs: Nuclear Analytical Techniques (NAT) and the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS). This award also aims to increase participation in the NAT School of students of underrepresented groups who will be selected through the application process of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Physics program at UC Davis."

A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award will fund the continued participation of this group in the DarkSide-50 (DS-50) Dark Matter experiment at the Gran Sasso underground national laboratory in Italy. A detailed understanding of the DS-50 backgrounds and performance is key to the design of future liquid argon (LAr) dark matter detectors with substantially better sensitivity for heavy WIMPs.

The primary goals are: 1) To further our knowledge of how conformal symmetry constrains correlation functions in CFTs. While the forms of 2-point and 3-point functions are fixed by conformal symmetry, 4-point functions are not completely determined, and can in general be expanded into a basis of functions called conformal blocks. Knowing how to perform these expansions explicitly is extremely important for formulating basic consistency conditions (called crossing symmetry) in any field theory with conformal symmetry. The PI will develop the theory of conformal blocks, focusing on situations (e.g., correlation functions of operators with spin and CFTs in odd dimensions) where these decompositions are poorly understood. 2) To perform detailed analytical and numerical studies of the implications of crossing symmetry and unitarity (the conformal bootstrap) in CFTs. These studies will produce general rigorous bounds on physical observables (operator dimensions) and develop techniques to predict their values in a wide variety of physically relevant theories. By pursuing these studies, the PI is seeking to map out the space of CFTs, identify new CFTs and learn about known ones, make quantitative predictions for experimentally realizable condensed matter systems, explore the validity of ideas in physics beyond the standard model, and test and formulate new theoretical conjectures related to the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity. <br/><br/>Conformal invariance is a generalization of scale invariance that only requires that the angles between corresponding curves do not change.  Conformal field theories (CFT) lie at the heart of theoretical physics, linking all the fields of physics represented within the Physics Division as well as other programs in other Divisions in NSF.  They are ubiquitous in the space of quantum field theories; they holographically describe (connect properties in a volume to the information encoded in the surface of that volume) consistent theories of quantum gravity; they are realized in a wide variety of real-world condensed matter systems such as the critical three-dimensional Ising model of ferromagnetism in terms of the coupling between spins of neighboring atoms; and they may even play an important role in physics beyond the Standard Model, the concept that accurately describes the known elementary particles in terms of quarks, leptons and gauge fields. There are wide classes of physically relevant CFTs where conventional field theory techniques such as perturbation theory and large-N expansions cannot be used. The recursive conformal bootstrap approach is currently underdeveloped and appears to be an extremely promising way of making quantitative predictions for physical observables in these otherwise intractable theories.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : The education and outreach component of this program will introduce students at all education levels to the power of symmetry in physics. 1) The PI is developing a series of hands-on demonstrations illustrating principles of symmetry in physics, being made available to middle and high school students in racially diverse and high poverty school districts through Yale's ""Math Mornings"" lecture series and during a ""Theoretical Physics Day"" hosted by the PI. 2) The PI is developing a public lecture on ""Symmetries in Physics"" to be given in multiple venues. 3) The PI is developing and teaching two distinct 3-day Modules for Yale's Pathways Science Collaborative Hands-On Learning and Research (SCHOLAR) program, one focusing on symmetries of space and time and one focusing on exploring scale invariance and extra dimensions. 4) The PI is actively involving Yale undergraduates in his research as well as including their participation in outreach activities. 5) The PI is developing a new graduate level course on ""Conformal Field Theories"", introducing Yale students to modern research topics, giving them opportunities to develop their oral presentation skills, and producing a set of lecture notes that will be disseminated publicly."

The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and from community colleges. The project plans to be informed by an on-going evaluation, which examines clear goals."

This project will test the limits of how living things detect light and study how the laws of quantum mechanics apply to biological systems. Single photons (individual particles of light) will be used to study both the human visual system and light-sensitive bacteria. In the human visual system, this project will determine whether humans can see a single photon (a longstanding question in psychology) by using a method of creating one photon at a time to test the vision of human observers. This project will also investigate what human observers see when they detect a photon in a superposition - a state of being in two places at the same time - which is allowed by quantum mechanics. Light-sensitive bacteria will also be studied using single photons, to understand the limits of light detection and the possible effects of quantum laws in a different biological system. In addition to advancing our knowledge of how living things detect and use light, this research might help us understand why particles such as photons show strange quantum behavior such as superposition, while the familiar world around us behaves differently. Making quantum effects available to human perception would also have broad popular appeal, and could be a gateway for students and the public to learn about quantum physics.<br/><br/>To produce single photons, this project will use a well-known heralded single-photon source design based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. Single photons at 505 nm and 440 nm will be used for experiments with humans and E. coli, respectively. To determine whether humans can see single photons, observers will complete a series of trials in which they must choose whether the stimulus photon appeared on the left or the right side of their visual field. If observers are able to choose left or right with accuracy statistically greater than 50%, this is strong evidence that they can see single photons. An EEG-contingent stimulus delivery method will also be developed to improve the likelihood of detection. If single-photon vision is confirmed, a subsequent experiment will attempt a test of quantum nonlocality with a human observer replacing one single-photon detector. Finally, to test perception of superposition states, observers will be presented with both a classical mixture of photons at the left and right spots, and photons in a superposition of left and right. The observer's frequency of choosing left and right will be compared between the two cases, with any unexpected difference suggesting a deviation from standard quantum mechanics. To study phototactic bacteria (which move in response to light), individual E. coli cells will be immobilized in an IR optical trap and stimulated with single photons. In an established technique, the response of the cells can be measured by tracking their swimming and tumbling behavior with the trapping beam. Other species will be studied in following experiments, including photosynthetic Rhodobacter sphaeroides."

In addition, the center will host seminars and symposia that will connect CPBF with the larger scientific community and will engage in public lectures in New York City.<br/><br/>The CPBF research activities are organized around four themes, each of which will involve close collaboration between theory and experiment.  The first focuses on animal behavior from the development of organisms to locomotion.  The second considers the emergence of collective phenomena in groups of molecules, genes, neurons, and organisms. The third theme studies the role of physical limits on information transfer and processing in the genetic code, neural circuits, cellular sensors, and genetic and biochemical networks.

Ionized gas, or in scientific terms plasma, is the most common state of matter in the Universe. In the solar system, for example, the solar corona where solar eruptions occur, the solar wind that carries the erupted plasma and magnetic field from the Sun to the Earth, the magnetosphere surrounding the Earth and protecting us from the harmful effects of the eruption, and the ionosphere through which radio communications and GPS signals propagate and get disturbed, all consist of plasma. Understanding plasma is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of space weather. Plasmas also play an important role in engineering, for example in the design of fusion type reactors that promise to provide an inexhaustible source of clean energy for humanity. Computational modeling of plasma dynamics is very challenging due to the different spatial and temporal scales and the complex behavior of the system. The project is aimed at improving the efficiency of present plasma simulation models by a factor of 1000 or even more. If successful, the new model will provide accurate and affordable simulations for systems that currently cannot be modeled even on the largest supercomputers.<br/><br/>There are different approaches for plasma modeling that all have advantages and drawbacks. The most accurate kinetic methods describe all the important effects of plasma by describing the full distribution function in a six dimensional phase space, but they have tremendous computational cost. Even on today's supercomputers, modeling a large three-dimensional system with kinetic methods is far out of reach. Alternative fluid-type methods describe the plasma distribution function with a handful of moments, such as density, velocity and pressure. Solving for these quantities in addition to the magnetic field can be done quite efficiently, and in fact one can model the solar corona, the solar wind, and the magnetosphere with global fluid models with reasonable computational resources. Unfortunately, in most systems there are some parts of the domain where the fluid description is not sufficient, and this can have consequences for the global solution. The project aims at combining the kinetic and fluid type methods in an adaptive and dynamic fashion. The expensive kinetic model will be restricted to the small parts of the domain where the fluid description is not accurate enough, while the efficient fluid methods will be employed in the vast majority of the domain. This hybrid approach promises to provide accurate solutions at a tiny fraction of the cost of the fully kinetic models. A speed up of factor of 1000 or even more is expected. This will allow modeling global plasma systems with unprecedented accuracy and vastly improve our understanding and predictive capabilities."

In most cases, cells do not move in isolation but move in groups. This collective motion is a process that is not yet well understood. In particular, it is not clear how cells that move within a group communicate and how cell-cell interaction and intracellular communication result in asymmetric, polarized cells. To tackle these questions using in vivo experiments is challenging since these experiments are hard to visualize and manipulate. In vitro experiments that follow large sheets of cells are slightly less difficult to visualize and probe but their results are not always easy to interpret, and are thus not ideal to determine the fundamental mechanisms of cell-cell interactions. To build a physics-based model for collective migration is also challenging, not only because the precise cell-cell interactions and intra-cellular mechanisms are unclear but also because the physical properties of cells, including membrane tension and rigidity, and cell morphology changes are difficult to implement. In this project the PI will overcome these challenges using an approach that combines theoretical and experimental investigations. He will formulate an efficient physics-based model that can incorporate the physical properties of deformable cells. The general framework of this model should be applicable to a wide variety of cell motility problems. He will also carry out careful and quantitative experiments. The proposed theoretical and experimental research will lead to deeper and fundamental insights into the mechanisms and processes involved in collective cell migration. The results will have direct relevance to many biological processes, including embryogenesis and wound healing. The PI anticipates that the theoretical and computational models developed as part of the proposal will be applicable to a wide range of multi-cellular processes and will have broad implications for biological modeling. In addition, the experiments should shed light on how cells interact when they collide, and how small groups of cells coordinate their motion. The PI will include the training of high school, undergraduates, and graduate students who will be directly involved in the proposed research. He will recruit talented underrepresented minorities through the on-going outreach efforts and programs of the Department of Physics and the Division of Physical Sciences and will offer two Research Experiences for Undergraduates internships. These students will be integrated into the lab and taught how to design, carry out, and interpret experiments and simulations. The goal is to attract diverse students to a career in the biophysical sciences. Furthermore, the PI will extend his existing collaboration with the Preuss Charter School, a top local high school that accepts students only from disadvantaged families. He will offer three internships to interested students, who can participate in all aspects of the research. Finally, the results of the project will be broadly disseminated to the academic community through publications, conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>The PI's experimental approach consists of first studying how a collision between a pair of cells affects their motion and polarity. He will then extend these investigations to a small group of cells and will determine how these cells move in a collective fashion. The experiments and simulations will be carried out on micro-patterned surfaces which enables the PI to carefully control cell polarization and will allow him to quantify not only cell motion but also the spatio-temporal dynamics of intra-cellular communication. By comparing the experimental and theoretical results on cell collisions the PI will be able to determine cell-cell interaction mechanisms and parameters. He will then simulate collective cell migration and generate predictions that can be experimentally verified, resulting in a two-way dialogue between experiments and modeling. Specifically, he aims to: 1) Develop a computational framework that is able to model multiple deformable cells, physical cell membrane properties and different cell polarization mechanisms, and apply it to cell-cell collisions and collective motion of groups containing a small number of cells, and 2) Perform experiments using eukaryotic cells confined to micro-patterned surfaces that quantify cell-cell collisions and collective cell migration using confocal microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A better understanding of these processes will help us understand the origin, nature, and fate of the universe.  A new way forward is possible using neutrinos, tiny particles with zero charge, almost no mass, and only weak interactions.  Neutrinos are abundantly produced in astrophysical systems.  Detecting neutrinos is extraordinarily difficult, but, when successful, it reveals physical conditions of sources that are otherwise hidden by thick layers of matter that neutrinos can readily stream through.  The PI will lead a broad program of theoretical work on neutrino astrophysics, closely coupled to experimental physics and observational astronomy, designed to lead to breakthroughs in understanding astrophysical systems and neutrino properties.  Junior scientists will be trained on cutting-edge research as well as the general skills needed for career success.  The PI and junior scientists will work to share results with the public and to broaden participation by under-represented groups, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.<br/><br/>The PI will lead a research program with four thrusts: solar neutrinos, supernova burst neutrinos, the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), and the particle properties of neutrinos.  These thrusts are closely connected.  Eventual outcomes could include sensitive new tests of solar-neutrino mixing and first detections of certain solar-fusion processes; precise observation of a Milky Way supernova and detailed probes of the hot proto-neutron star and possible black hole formation; and unprecedented new tests of neutrino properties plus the discovery of new neutrino sources.  An especially important goal is the detection and interpretation of the DSNB, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the core collapses of massive stars over billions of years.  The latter is now within reach because Super-Kamiokande has accepted the Beacom-Vagins GADZOOKS! proposal to add gadolinium to enable neutron detection.  Detection of these neutrinos will probe the cosmic star formation history that shapes the visible universe and builds up chemical elements, neutron stars and black holes, and cosmic rays.  It would also probe the neutrino emission per core collapse that reflects the physics of neutron stars and black holes, and allows new tests of neutrino properties.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences."

This ubiquitous process of ""biomineralization"" depends on the precise action of specialized proteins within cells to form minerals where they are needed and prevent their accumulation in sensitive tissues.  Although progress has been made, much is not understood about how biomineralization is realized inside of individual cells and which genes control the process.  This collaborative project will address this challenge by applying recent advances in magnetic imaging technology to detailed studies of biomineralization in a simple and well-controlled biological system: the production of nanoscale magnetic particles within magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), and the use by MTB of chains of these particles (known as magnetosomes) for orientation and travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines (known as magnetotaxis).  During this project, students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in scientific practices at the interface of the physical and life sciences.  In addition, the project may inform the development of improved materials with broad practical relevance, as products of biomineralization have superior properties compared to those currently engineered by humans.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this project are to study the molecular mechanisms governing biomineralization and the development of magnetic nanoparticles in MTB.  The studies will employ a ""diamond magnetic imager"" that exploits a nanoscale layer of quantum sensors at the surface of a diamond chip, enabling imaging of magnetic field patterns from individual MTB in a population under ambient laboratory conditions, with better than 50 nanometer spatial resolution and greater than 1 millimeter field-of-view.  The investigators will apply the diamond magnetic imager to studies of magnetic nanoparticle growth in various MTB species and biomineralization mutants.  The project will open a new window onto the physical processes enabling magnetotaxis, including the transition of magnetic nanoparticles from a superparamagnetic to a stable single-domain magnetic state during magnetic nanoparticle growth, and the role of interactions between magnetic nanoparticles within individual MTB.  Magnetic measurements on genetic mutants will provide biological insights into the genes controlling the biomineralization process.  Observations will also be made of the dynamics of the magnetic nanoparticle chain during the cell division cycle, both through time series magnetic measurements on different MTB as well as magnetic imaging of individual living MTB."

The situation in physics is particularly alarming: fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one shortage area for new K-12 teachers. The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project vision is that every student will have the opportunity to learn physics from a highly qualified teacher, thus enabling the U.S. to meet the high demand for STEM professionals. Since 2001, PhysTEC, led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), has been working to engage physics departments in establishing the educational infrastructure needed to address the national physics teacher shortage. The project developed over 40 model teacher preparation programs that more than doubled their production of highly qualified physics teachers, and these new teachers have high retention rates. These PhysTEC Sites also demonstrated considerable success in sustaining their programs beyond their funded period. To disseminate effective practices and knowledge, the project established a national coalition of more than 300 Member Institutions; these institutions collectively prepare over half of the nation's highly qualified physics teachers. Building on this widespread engagement of the physics community and project knowledge and experience from many successful programs, PhysTEC will pursue three interrelated goals toward building a solution to the national physics teacher shortage. The project will: (1) directly engage dozens of institutions to prepare greater numbers of highly qualified physics teachers, (2) test the effectiveness of ""levers"" for engaging physics departments to enable the development of scalable change initiatives, and (3) validate a model for thriving programs that prepare large numbers of highly qualified physics teachers. PhysTEC will develop ""next generation PhysTEC Sites that offer improved models for physics teacher preparation, including Comprehensive Sites that establish thriving programs to prepare 5 or more physics teachers per year, and Recruiting Sites to develop an appropriately scaled model for smaller institutions. The project will also explore innovative modalities for directly engaging larger numbers of institutions at lower cost and offer readily scalable solutions. Improving the national infrastructure for preparing greater numbers of highly qualified physics teachers will help ensure excellence in physics education for tens of thousands of K-12 students across the nation each year, and thousands of college students including future teachers will benefit from transformed courses at PhysTEC Sites. In addition, PhysTEC will disseminate knowledge on teacher preparation to a broad national audience, including the 60,000 combined members of APS and AAPT, through conferences, workshops, publications, online communications, and a website. Further, the project will engage with disciplinary professional societies and other organizations to offer PhysTEC as a paradigm to address teacher shortages in other STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project integrates knowledge gained from previous efforts with theories of institutional change to inform a complex, systems approach to change initiatives. A comprehensive evaluation plan will investigate the effectiveness of PhysTEC initiatives to engage physics departments, develop capacity for change, and improve physics teacher preparation; formative evaluation will guide improvements to PhysTEC initiatives. Participating institutions will adopt research-based practices, including instructional practices shown to increase student learning and develop knowledge and skills for teaching physics. Peer-reviewed publications will add to the knowledge base for STEM teacher preparation.

In condensed matter, strong interactions determine the formation of topological phases giving materials unexpected physical properties that could revolutionize technology through robustness to noise and disorder. In quantum chemistry, determining the electronic structure of molecules is a problem of strongly correlated matter that establishes the static, dynamic and interaction properties of molecules as well as being key in tackling questions ranging from basic biology to translational medicine. This project will tackle these problems through the analog and digital simulation of their quintessential strongly-interacting properties on an apparatus with ultracold neutral atoms in optical tweezers. In the analog simulations, all the physics of the strongly correlated systems will be simultaneously emulated or mimicked, while the digital version will use a stroboscopic approach. The breadth and depth of this project, both in experimental tools and novel theoretical developments, will provide a rich educational environment for students at all levels and from all backgrounds, and inspire them to purse creative scientific careers in industry and academia. This environment will reach far beyond the research through a program for middle and high school students, the Young Physicist Program, by bringing the students to the University of California - San Diego labs and facilities to learn about fundamental topics in the quantifiable world via simplified college-level laboratories and interactive demonstrations.<br/><br/><br/>This project will use ultracold fermionic strontium atoms in polychromatic optical tweezers and beams to realize an analog simulator of fractional Chern insulators and to demonstrate the building blocks of a digital simulator of many-body fermionic open systems. The simulation of the topological insulating state will follow an optical flux approach, which engineers the lattice in reciprocal space through polychromatic beams driving a manifold of Raman transitions, and will benefit from ultracold strontium's low temperatures and reduced heating by spontaneous emission. The digital simulator, on the other hand, uses a stroboscopic approximation of the many-body Hamiltonian, or Liouvillian for open systems, through a set of elementary operations, much like a quantum computer, but with fermions instead of qubits, and arbitrary hopping and interactions between fermionic modes, instead of qubit gates. Polychromatic and mobile tweezers will exquisitely trap and precisely transport strontium atoms, both tasks achieved selectively for atoms in their ground or long-lived excited states. The prospects of exquisitely controlling, manipulating and interacting single fermions would exceed by far that achieved over the last two decades of doing the same with qubits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying the larva's simplified olfactory system will advance understanding of the basic principles of human sense of smell. Insects are mportant disease vectors and agricultural pests who rely extensively on smells to locate food, hosts, and mates, so this work will have important applications in pest control. Undergraduates and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups, will be actively involved in the research. An additional component of this project is outreach to local elementary students, especially the creation of a program to engage students in tinkering and construction. <br/><br/>How do brains make decisions based on noisy and often conflicting sensory input? Why does the same input elicit variable behaviors, even in the simplest organisms? This project aims to use the fruit fly larva's sense of smell as a model to explore these questions by studying the olfactory system of the Drosophila larva. A given odor stimulates or inhibits a set of odor receptor neurons, yet on the basis of this pattern of stimulation, organisms from flies to humans recognize and classify odors rapidly and reliably. The PI will image the responses of odorant receptor neurons in the larva's dorsal organ (its ""nose"") to understand how olfactory information is first presented to the brain, taking advantage of the genetic tools available in Drosophila, the larva's transparency, and custom built apparatus developed in the PI's lab. A second goal of this project is to develop the technology necessary to take full advantage of the larva as a model for decoding the neural circuitry of olfaction. To move towards or away from an odor, the larva uses sensory input to drive motor output. In this process, it modulates a number of behaviors, e.g. moving forward, stopping, and sweeping the head to one side or the other. The rules by which the larva changes its motor output in response to sensory input in order to move towards a goal represent a navigational strategy. Using light activated ion channels the PI will evoke activity directly in the sensory neurons in order to measure the computations involved in transforming temporal variations in sensory input into directed motor output. The promise of the larva, a small crawling animal with a transparent skin, is that the neural activity in freely behaving animals can be visualized. In practice, we do not have a microscope capable of keeping up with a moving animal. The project will develop a microscope that can track individual neurons in a moving larva making possible to ""read the larva's mind"" as it goes about its business, allowing us to link together sensory input, neural activity, and evoked behavior in order to understand the function of neural circuits. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrated Orgamismal System, and the Emerging Frontiers program in the Biological Sciences Directorate."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

The very high energies that can be reached through accelerators today has been enabled by the use of superconducting magnets to supply the energy to the cavity.  But with any cavity, the behavior of the beam is strongly influenced by the structure of the magnetic field within the cavity.  This work aims at improving the performance and efficiency of superconducting resonator cavities used in modern particle accelerators by addressing the impact of irregularities in the magnetic field within the cavity. A novel experimental apparatus will be developed along with new theoretical models to carry out this study.

Such colliding electrons and molecular ions initiate a network of chemical reactions, and these processes determine various properties of the partially ionized gas. Due to the richness of its chemical properties, such systems have many technological applications. These include the semiconductor industry, where they are used to fabricate integrated circuits. They also occur in thermonuclear fusion efforts, in medical physics (plasma healing), in high-power chemical lasers, and in depollution technologies. The observation of the molecular ionized gas present in the interstellar medium and the upper atmosphere allows researches to study its properties using ground- and space-based telescopes. For its efficient use in applications, it is important to understand and predict the behavior of the ionized gas under different conditions (temperature, density, presence of other molecules, etc.). High chemical reactivity makes this difficult. Because the behavior is governed by microscopic processes such as electron-ion collisions, a quantum mechanical approach is necessary to determine properties and to predict macroscopic properties. That is the goal of this effort.  In this project, researchers focus on two types of processes: destruction of molecular ions in collisions with electrons and the detachment of an electron from negatively-charged molecular ions due to radiation. There processes are important for cold molecular plasmas, at room temperature and below.<br/><br/>Despite the significant progress in theoretical description of fundamental mechanisms in collisions of electrons with neutral molecules and positive molecular ions in low temperature plasma, there remain a few key mechanisms that require the development of new theoretical methods. The need of the theoretical development is dictated not only by a lack of fundamental understanding, but by very practical interests in applications to plasma engineering, plasma-depolution technologies, and space sciences technologies. One such problem that is extremely important in applications, but not satisfactorily described by the present state of AMO theory, is the branching ratios (BR) in dissociation of polyatomic molecules after a collision of the positive molecular ion with an electron - dissociative recombination (DR): branching ratios in DR with respect to electronic, vibrational, and rotational states of the products. Another problem related to even colder systems is how negative molecular ions are formed and destroyed. There is no satisfactory theoretical approach that can describe the photodetachment (PD) process accounting for the rovibrational structure of the parent anion and the resulting neutral molecule, especially, for photon energies near detachment thresholds, where rotational channels are coupled. This research program will focus on two objectives: <br/>1. The development of a set of simple theoretical approaches to determine branching ratios in DR of small polyatomic ions. A theoretical description of the BR is difficult because the process involves non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling between motion of the incident electron and rovibrational dynamics of the target.<br/>2. The development of a theoretical method for the description of the PD process in polyatomic anions and a study of the role of the weakly-bound electronic state in the PD and the inverse process - radiative electronic attachment. In this project the investigators will develop a theoretical method describing the PD process in molecular anions with resolved rovibrational structure and accounting for the correct near-threshold behavior and the multi-channel interaction in the final state. The method will be applied to several anions that are important in astrophysics and being studied experimentally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

Photocathodes with improved emission properties are desirable for certain next generation light sources, such as those based on Free Electron Laser (FEL) or Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) technologies.  They are also needed for high-resolution microscopy tools such as Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscopy (DTEM) devices.  Accelerators are also used by industry for a variety of manufacturing tasks.  Thermionic cathodes are typically used for industrial accelerators, although the beam properties of photocathodes would in some applications be more desirable.  Some examples are medical radiological accelerators, and electron beam machining and welding.  The cost and complication of photocathode operation discourages their use in industry.  A goal of this award is to apply a multidisciplinary research approach to discover methods to modify the photocathode surface to manipulate emission properties, making them cheaper to operate, or else improve their performance.<br/><br/>With this award, an investigation of the use of thin film deposition to modify photo-emissive surface properties in a systematic way will be carried out.  Specifically, development of novel photocathodes including plasmonic cathodes with thin coatings, and thin epitaxial multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures is planned.  It may be possible to make robust, high quantum efficiency metallic plasmonic nanostructured cathodes by deposition of a thin layer of material such as BaO on the surface.  The goal is to manipulate the photocathode to operate at visible, rather than ultra-violet wavelengths, making the technology more accessible for industrial applications.  The thin flanking layers of MgO utilized in multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures modify the surface band structure; and emission properties vary systematically with layer thickness.  Previous research can be continued, both to investigate how robust these structures are in an accelerator environment, and to determine more fully how performance depends on properties such as the surface roughness."

This ubiquitous process of ""biomineralization"" depends on the precise action of specialized proteins within cells to form minerals where they are needed and prevent their accumulation in sensitive tissues.  Although progress has been made, much is not understood about how biomineralization is realized inside of individual cells and which genes control the process.  This collaborative project will address this challenge by applying recent advances in magnetic imaging technology to detailed studies of biomineralization in a simple and well-controlled biological system: the production of nanoscale magnetic particles within magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), and the use by MTB of chains of these particles (known as magnetosomes) for orientation and travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines (known as magnetotaxis).  During this project, students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in scientific practices at the interface of the physical and life sciences.  In addition, the project may inform the development of improved materials with broad practical relevance, as products of biomineralization have superior properties compared to those currently engineered by humans.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this project are to study the molecular mechanisms governing biomineralization and the development of magnetic nanoparticles in MTB.  The studies will employ a ""diamond magnetic imager"" that exploits a nanoscale layer of quantum sensors at the surface of a diamond chip, enabling imaging of magnetic field patterns from individual MTB in a population under ambient laboratory conditions, with better than 50 nanometer spatial resolution and greater than 1 millimeter field-of-view.  The investigators will apply the diamond magnetic imager to studies of magnetic nanoparticle growth in various MTB species and biomineralization mutants.  The project will open a new window onto the physical processes enabling magnetotaxis, including the transition of magnetic nanoparticles from a superparamagnetic to a stable single-domain magnetic state during magnetic nanoparticle growth, and the role of interactions between magnetic nanoparticles within individual MTB.  Magnetic measurements on genetic mutants will provide biological insights into the genes controlling the biomineralization process.  Observations will also be made of the dynamics of the magnetic nanoparticle chain during the cell division cycle, both through time series magnetic measurements on different MTB as well as magnetic imaging of individual living MTB."

Atom interferometers are the most sensitive force measuring devices ever constructed and are well suited for precision measurements and detection of electric and magnetic fields, gravity, and inertial forces, such as accelerations and rotations. Applications of atom interferometers include inertial navigation in a GPS-denied environment, remote sensing of underground structures, measuring atom-surface forces, and searching for deviations of the gravitational force from the inverse square law. While most atom interferometers operate with freely propagating atoms, one of the main scientific goals of this project is to develop and evaluate atom interferometers based on trapped atoms. Furthermore, the project will control these atoms using AC Zeeman potentials, a novel and little explored quantum control mechanism for applying forces on atoms using microwave fields generated in the vicinity of an atom chip. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers will be trained in atom interferometry, ultracold atom technologies, microwave engineering, and micro-fabrication techniques, as well as in the broadly enabling sciences of atomic and optical physics.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will construct ultracold trapped atom interferometers that are capable of long phase integration times with well localized, positionable atomic packets. These trapped atom interferometers will be spin-dependent so that the two arms of the interferometer have atoms in different quantum spin states. The spin-dependence will enable the interferometer to use atoms in many different spatial states so that it can employ ultracold thermal atoms or degenerate fermions, which are expected to suppress atom-atom interactions. The project will use AC Zeeman potentials generated by microwave near-fields from an atom chip to implement the spin-dependent forces and traps for the interferometer. Notably, the project will design and micro-fabricate a microwave atom chip for efficient generation of AC Zeeman potentials. An important objective of this project is to develop and characterize AC Zeeman traps and potentials, and thus evaluate them for inclusion in the toolbox of ultracold atomic physics techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These elementary interactions are the essential ingredients for the study of quantum many-body systems throughout physics and chemistry, and, increasingly, in biology and the life-sciences as well. In most applications of quantum mechanics to complex many-body systems, the pairwise interactions between atoms and/or molecules are approximated with simple analytical forms dictated by practicality and expedience, but which neglect essential physics. Better representations of these interactions through accurate, first-principle calculations, by contrast, are simply too complicated to incorporate into many-body studies. This project is part of an effort to resolve this conundrum and to develop quantum theories of fundamental atomic interactions that are both sufficiently simple and systematic to be incorporated into quantum many-body theories, and simultaneously accurate enough to capture all the essential physics. The degree to which this can be accomplished may well determine the relevance of theoretical models and simulations of many-body systems to real-world experimental observations.  <br/> <br/>The project builds on the recent success of quantum defect theories for atom-atom and ion-atom interactions. It intends both to apply them to develop better models for many-atom systems, and to extend them to other fundamental atomic interactions such as the electron-atom interaction. Quantum defect theories are general theories of structures and interactions that take advantage of the fact that over most energy ranges of interest, the complexities in atomic interactions, such as their energy and partial wave dependences, are due almost entirely to the long-range interaction, which makes them amenable to systematic and often analytic treatment. The project also intends to take initial steps towards the developments of quantum defect theories for anisotropic interactions, such as the atom-molecule interaction, with the ultimate goal of achieving a unified and an efficient framework for all aspects of atomic and molecular structures and interactions."

Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory.

Professor Olum will study how the shape and motion of cosmic string loops changes during their lives and how this affects their emission of gravitational waves that become part of this background.  If and when the gravitational wave background is discovered, this research will help us to distinguish whether it comes from cosmic strings or some other source, and to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if it is the source of the background.

The award supports the discovery and development of a technique to detect and uniquely identify one barium atom in five tons of liquid xenon using novel methods of laser spectroscopy.   The ultimate goal is the discovery of a rare radioactive decay, called neutrinoless double-beta decay, of the isotope 136Xe.  The proposed single-Ba detection technique would make the experimental search for this decay significantly more sensitive.  A discovery of this decay would show that neutrinos are the same as anti-neutrinos.  This would fundamentally change our view of the elementary components of matter and would potentially contribute to an understanding of why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe.  Instruments and methods developed in this project may be relevant to the kinds of matrix isolation experiments used in chemistry.   The proposed work also has very important educational and outreach components, as it connects high school teachers to state-of-the-art research.  <br/><br/><br/>A major breakthrough in detecting barium atoms in solid xenon at the single atom level has recently been achieved. Continued interdisciplinary research will be supported in which individual atoms of Ba will be imaged by laser-induced fluorescence while trapped in a matrix of solid Xe grown first on a sapphire window and then at the end on an optically accessible probe.  Research on grabbing and detecting Ba atoms on a probe from liquid xenon is also planned.  The ultimate goal of the work is to capture and detect a single 136Ba daughter of neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136Xe, advancing what may be the ultimate background suppression method for ton-scale experiments. The possibility afforded by this technique is unique to 136Xe and, coupled to a second phase of the nEXO detector, could substantially improve its sensitivity beyond 10^28 year half life, allowing the exploration of part of the normal hierarchy regime of neutrino mass.  The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay answers a grand challenge in nuclear physics, whether or not 2-component Majorana fermions exist in Nature.  This may shed some light on the puzzling fact that neutrinos have a finite mass and yet they are so much lighter than all other known particles. In addition the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would provide a measurement of the neutrino mass scale and demonstrate the first case of lepton number violation."

The specific aim is to extend the planned activities by supporting and encouraging participation by a larger number of leading American researchers, including 12 junior researchers, who would otherwise not be able to participate.  The planned program at the Newton Institute is to mark the centenary of D'Arcy Thompson's influential book, ""On Growth and Form"" - arguably the first treatise on the physics of living systems - by bringing various contemporary strands of inquiry in the spirit of his work into focus and to look into the future of understanding biology. The program will stimulate new interactions and collaborations between physicists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, biologists, and other researchers interested in morphology, broadly understood. It will aim to open fruitful lines of inquiry and invite new approaches to address the fundamental issues and features of form and function in living as well as inanimate systems. <br/><br/>The program will provide opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas within and across disciplines on various aspects of shape dynamics in diverse contexts and at diverse scales. Program participants will foster, and in turn be immersed in, an energetic and informal research atmosphere, conducive to innovative ideas, daring propositions, and potential breakthroughs, and to forming new kinds of fruitful collaborations. The Institute offers an ideal environment for such a ""ferment"" and actively promotes diversity. The program and the Institute work together to attract and ensure participation of women researchers. Considerable efforts and funds will also be devoted to supporting junior researchers and students, assuring lasting impact. All lectures and seminars will be open to the public, filmed, archived and made freely accessible on the Institute's website. The four planned thematic workshops will provide further opportunities for sharing and developing ideas, which will be disseminated through proceedings, papers, and newly emerged research directions and endeavors."
